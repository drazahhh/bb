I've heard of the vast knowledge held by the revered Eme-ans, and I was hoping you could shed some light on them for me.

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> My name is Poteh.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> I bow beneath the majesty of Pharaoh, beneath the radiance of the Sun, may Pharaoh's reign endure forever, as eternal as the Sun's unceasing light.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> By Pharaoh's decree, I record my observations here, to dispel wicked and corrupt rumors, ensuring the brilliance of the Sun is remembered for generations.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Names hold power, the names of things grant them their form of existence.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Different names for the same thing reveal different aspects of its essence.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> That is to say\

  ["13228"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> That blazing sphere crossing the skythe Delphians call it Helios, the Javanites call it Apollo, and the Ubaid call it Mithra.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> The scribes and priests of Pharaoh, however, address it with more arcane and enigmatic names and their variants:\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> Ra, Horus, Atum, Khepri, Amun.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> I, Poteh, bear witness that all of these are but false names.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> The true nature of a thing is revealed only by invoking its true name.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> The city where Pharaoh resides is sacred and supreme, named Ehtaton.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> Ehtaton cannot be marked on mortal maps, just as one cannot mark the Sun's position on a star chartfor when the Sun appears, the stars vanish.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> Sailing north along the White River from the old city of Memphis, when you see the river stretch vast as the sea, Ehtaton is near at hand.",
  ["13229"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> Do not attempt to measure the distance or calculate the direction, for a perpetual mist veils the surface of the waters, obscuring all sights beyond the city of Pharaoh.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> In Ehtaton, I bore witness: the river stretched boundlessly, transforming into the Eternal River.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> In Ehtaton, I bore witness: the holy city stood solemn and majestic, like the throne of the Sun.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> In Ehtaton, I bore witness: golden arches rose from the Eternal River, shaped like a great serpent spanning the heavens, with Pharaoh's city nestled beneath, as a lotus rests beneath the divine Memphis.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> In Ehtaton, I bore witness: the Sun traversed the arch, rising in the east and setting in the west, as wheels roll within their tracks.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> In Ehtaton, I bore witness: the earth once trembled, the walls of the Eternal City crumbled, and the Sun fell from one end of the arch, floating dim and lifeless upon the waters.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> In Ehtaton, I bore witness: the true form of the Sun is neither eagle, nor ram, nor bull, nor cobra.",
  ["1323"]="Character Name",
  ["13230"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> It was a massive metallic sphere, etched with intricate patterns and designs, crafted with such extraordinary precision that all artisans of the mortal realm would feel ashamed in its presence.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> At that time, Pharaoh approached aboard the Solar Bark, accompanied by priests. The priests prostrated themselves at the prow, chanting prayers and invoking the names of Ra, Horus, Atum, Khepri, and Amun. The Sun remained motionless.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Then Pharaoh stepped forward and called upon the true name of the Sun.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> And so, the Sun awakened, its light rekindled, ascending once more along the golden arch to resume its celestial course, endlessly repeating the cycle.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Thereafter, Pharaoh decreed that all subjects of Upper and Lower Memphis must not call the Sun by its false names, for the true name of the Sun is unique and unparalleled.\
 \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> It is \"Aten.\"",
  ["13231"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> I, craftsman of Ehtaton, humble servant of the gods, await the commands of the Lord of Upper and Lower Memphis to repair walls, roads, palaces, and tombs.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> My name is Lifitu.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> With my heart and soul, I curse the false sun god and the false Pharaoh.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> The Pharaoh is bewitched, and the blind priests know only how to pander to his deluded desires.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Here, I swear, our Sun is Ra, our Moon is Horus, our Wind is Shu, our Sky is Nut, and our lord in the afterlife is Osiris.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Here, I swear to reveal the true face of the false god.",
  ["13232"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> In the twenty-second year of the Pharaoh's reign, divine wrath descended upon Ehtaton. The ground trembled, and the palaces and walls crumbled into ruins.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> The false sun atop the golden arch ceased its motion, rolling down the arch and falling to the earth, into the Eternal River, where it floated upon the water's surface.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Night fell upon Ehtaton, leaving only the vast expanse of stars in the sky.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Yet, these were not the stars familiar to the people of Memphis, nor were their strange constellations mentioned in the oldest legends.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Has anyone ever heard of a true sun falling from the sky? Thus, it could only be a false sun, struck down by the gods as punishment for its arrogance.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> The priests declared: All things have names, and all names have power. A name gives form to an object, and form fixes that object's spirit into place.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Simply by calling upon the false sun's name, it could be made to rise back into the heavens.",
  ["13233"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> The Pharaoh commanded the priests to call upon the names of Ra, Horus, Atum, Khepri, and Amun, but the false sun gave no response.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> Of course, these are the names of the true sun; how could the false sun ever be worthy of such names?\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> Thus, the Pharaoh ordered the priests to uncover the false sun's true name.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> The priests, bound to the ancient records of their books, could do no more than follow their decrees. Beyond the texts, their wisdom and abilities were no greater than that of a three-year-old child.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> The priest Poteh commanded the artisans to fulfill the Pharaoh's demand.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> I was unwilling to commit such a blasphemous act, yet the gods resided far beyond the Reed Fields, while the Pharaoh's executioners stood near at hand.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> Therefore, I have recorded the whole truth here. May the Nine Judges of the Divine Tribunal forgive my heart.",
  ["13234"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> This task was not difficult. Within the languages of Upper and Lower Memphis, there are a total of thirty single-syllable words, eighty double-syllable words, and fifty triple-syllable words.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> Within the rules of hieratic script, the names formed by these syllables and characters are finite. A simple calculation revealed approximately 47,960,000 possible combinations.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> The number was vast, yet not beyond human effort.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> In the lands of the Pharaoh, the subjects were as numerous as the grains of sand along the banks of the White River.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> The Pharaoh issued a decree, summoning all laborers from the temples and tomb construction sites along the western bank of the White River to come to Ehtaton. Their task was to recite, day and night without rest, every possible name derived from the combinations of hieratic script.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> This endeavor consumed nearly a year.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color> The long night persisted for an entire year as well, during which only candlelight and the strange stars illuminated the Pharaoh's city.",
  ["13235"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> Yet, if one simply sailed upriver and left Ehtaton, once the perpetual mist upon the waters dispersed, the true sun would again reveal itself.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> It continued to rise in the east and set in the west, shining upon the White River, shining upon Memphis.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Finally, someone spoke the false god's name, and the patterns on the surface of the false sun suddenly began to shimmer.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> The priest Potaheh immediately commanded the chanting to cease, and the axe bearers executed the unfortunate soul who first uttered the true name of the false god.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> The honor of awakening the false sun could belong only to the Pharaoh.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> The Pharaoh stepped forward and called the false god's name nine times.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> With each invocation, the false sun grew brighter. By the ninth call, it burned with an unbearable brilliance, rolling across the waters toward the golden arch and ascending once more into the heavens.",
  ["13236"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> The Pharaoh, overcome with joy, decreed the abandonment of his own exalted true name: Amenhotep, and instead declared himself the servant of the false god.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> He further commanded his subjects to cease venerating the ancient gods, proclaiming that there was but one true god in existencethe false god of the sun.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> I spit upon such blasphemy.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> When sparrows and house cats lie asleep, their masters may rouse them merely by calling their names.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> The false sun is no different from sparrows and house catsit is of the same ilk.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> When the Pharaoh dies, the Nine Judges of the Divine Tribunal will surely judge his soul and weigh his heart.",
  ["13237"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> I, once a general of the Pharaoh, bear titles too numerous to inscribe at this moment.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> My name is Taharqa.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> May the sun god ensure that my name is never erased from the stone. I curse the despicable Pharaoh and no longer acknowledge him as the son of the sun.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> By the Pharaoh's command, I guarded Memphis's capital, Ehtaton.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> In the twenty-fifth year of the Pharaoh's reign, I first beheld the secret at the heart of Ehtaton.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Beneath the Pharaoh's palace lay an abyss, and within that abyss, the sun continued its course.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> That night, the Pharaoh ordered the execution of the priests who had secretly worshipped the sun within the abyss.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Over the past several years, these priests had sought to manipulate Ehtaton's sun and undermine the authority of the Pharaoh.",
  ["13238"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> Despicable traitors, their deaths were well-deserved.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> By the Pharaoh's command, I first severed their tongues, so they could never again utter blasphemies. Then, I cast them into the abyss.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> But the Pharaoh himself proved to be just as vile.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Upon returning to the surface, my men and I found a hundred fully armed archers awaiting us within the palace chamber.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> I fought my way out, taking refuge in the palace library, where I barricaded the door. Even as I write these words, they are battering it with a siege ram.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> I hastily inscribe my final account here, hiding it among the countless scrolls. May it escape the grasp of the treacherous Pharaoh and reveal to those under the sun in future generations the crimes of Ehtaton.",
  ["13239"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> I, Pharaoh, the Son of the Sun, the Radiance of the Sun on Earth, and the Sovereign of Upper and Lower Memphis.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Many Pharaohs of generations past favored the temples and priests of Ra, granting them wealth, land, and slaves, allowing these priests to grow increasingly arrogant.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> To remind the priests who truly holds divine authority, I decreed the capital be moved from Memphis to Ehtaton.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> This decision stemmed from my discovery, years ago, of true wonders in Ehtaton.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> The greatest miracle of Ehtaton is the golden serpent arch and the sun that rests atop it.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> That, of course, is not the true sun, not the god Ra sailing his celestial barque across the sky.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> But I commanded the priests to venerate it as though it were the true sun.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Beneath the golden serpent arch, I built Ehtaton. The construction took nineteen years.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> By day, laborers toiled on the surface. By night, my trusted artisans and priests labored in secret underground.",
  ["1324"]="Requirement Description",
  ["13240"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color> The secrets of Ehtaton are as numerous as the stars in the heavens.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> Beneath my royal palace, descending into the earth some one hundred and twenty steps, lies a bottomless abyss, akin to the edge of the underworld.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> The other half of the golden serpent arch spans this abyss, the two halves forming a perfect ouroborosa ring with its head and tail joinedencircling Ehtaton and the River of Eternity within.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> The sun of Ehtaton rises each day from the eastern horizon of the River of Eternity, sets in the west, and each night traverses the abyss to return to the east.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> At night, the sun's radiance fades, cold and pale as the moon.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> In the twenty-second year of my reign, Ehtaton was struck by an earthquake, and the sun tumbled into the river's surface.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color> I commanded the priests to discover its true name. Summoning two hundred thousand laborers, they recited all combinations day and night until they finally uncovered its name: Aten.",
  ["13241"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>I decreed that all Upper and Lower Memphis should revere Aten, just as they once revered Ra and Horus.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>If a name could make Aten shine once more, it naturally begged the question: could there be other utterances that might compel Aten to perform other actions?\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>If so, I would become the greatest Pharaoh in the thousands of years of Upper and Lower Memphis. I would become the sun incarnate on earth.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I commanded the priests to recite every spell and prayer they could conceive to Aten as it passed through the abyss each night.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>This work was long, monotonous, and utterly exhausting.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>High Priest Poteh, overcome with tedium, abandoned meaningful words one night, instead uttering nonsensical babble: \"Ah-ah-ah-ten-ten-ah-ten-ten-ten-ah-ah-ah-ah-ten.\"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>This meaningless ramble wrought a miracle. The cold, dark Aten began to glow faintly in the night.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The priests immediately realized that to command Aten, one needed only to use the syllables \"Ah\" (j) and \"Ten\" (tn).",
  ["13242"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>We touched upon the language of the gods, the language used by the gods who created Aten. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>For the following 1,097 nights, Aten repeatedly lit up and dimmed beneath Ehtaton, as my priests tirelessly tested what effects could be achieved using the two-syllable language. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>At last, they presented me with a lexicon. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I am proud to have such intelligent and loyal servants. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>This lexicon revealed that Aten's light could not only illuminate the Eternal River but also shine on a specific place or even a single person. Its color, temperature, and intensity could all be altered. Moreover, the light could be transformed into tangible forms. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I abandoned my old name, Amenhotep, and renamed myself Akhenaten. \
 \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I am ready to become the sun incarnate on Earth.",
  ["13243"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>I, the general of Pharaoh Akhenaten, the loyal servant of the Son of the Sun, and the blade of the Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>My name is Sabataka. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I write here all that I have witnessed: the fall of Ehtaton and the demise of the Pharaoh. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>In the 25th year of the Pharaoh's reign, my former comrade Taharqa rebelled, leading troops to secretly invade the Pharaoh's palace at night. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The Pharaoh ordered us to eliminate the rebels, and we carried out the command. May the Nine Gods obliterate Taharqa's deceitful heart. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The next day, Aten rose and illuminated the sky. The Pharaoh bathed in the Eternal River and held a grand celebration. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>At noon, the Pharaoh ascended the high platform. When Aten reached its zenith, the Pharaoh extended his hands and chanted a peculiar incantation, the likes of which no one had ever heard before. It sounded much like \"A-Aten-Aten-Aten-Ten-A-Aten-A-Aten.\"",
  ["13244"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Soon after, a miracle never before seen unfolded. The light of Aten folded inwards like the tail feathers of a peacock, dimming the sky and revealing the stars. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The gathered light cascaded down upon the high platform. Across all of Ehtaton, only the Pharaoh was graced with the sunlight's radiance. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I saw the beam of light shining upon the platform narrow further, converging entirely upon the Pharaoh. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Within the beam of light, it seemed as though a hand extended slowly from Aten, descending until it touched the Pharaoh's body. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I saw, at the moment of contact, the Pharaoh began to burn. He ceased his incantation and let out a cry of agony before disintegrating into a wisp of ash. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>No one dared step into the light, for the ground within its radiance began to melt, glowing red like molten iron. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I also saw Aten, cold as the moon, extend numerous similar \"hands,\" each as slender and brilliant as the beams of light. These hands reached from the sky to the earth, and everything they touched burned and melted.",
  ["13245"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>No one could count the number of handsperhaps a hundred, a thousand, or even ten thousand. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Each hand of Aten brought death, terror, and destruction. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ehtaton was consumed by a sea of firethis was the gift borne of the Pharaoh's prayer to Aten. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I fled from Ehtaton and returned to the sacred city of Memphis, but no one believed the story I told. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The priests thought I had lost my sanity and sent me to live among the sick. In this stifling, polluted room, I write these words, hoping they may be passed down to future generations.",

  ["13771"]="\"There dwells a beast named Xingxing, resembling an ape with white ears, always crouch walking. Consuming its meat grants amazing movement.\"\
Apes roaming the forests in Mount Tianque, their bodies toughened with an eerie cerulean hue, their arms hardened with Crystals from the influence of Cerulean Blight.\
Legends tell of a time so ancient that the concept of \"human\" had not yet emerged, when both Xing and the ancestors of early humans roamed a shared wilderness. However, as humans embraced civilization, the Xing clung to primal instincts. Overwhelmed by these primitive urges, the innate agility typical of apes vanished from the bloodline of the Xing, replaced by a ferocity akin to that of a predator.",
  ["13772"]="\"On Mount Gong dwells a beast characterized by its tortoise-like form, white body, and greenish bones, known as Gui.\"\
Turtles that once dwelt by rivers, now displaying a cyan hue as the Cerulean Blight infection intensifies. Their shells have transformed into jagged Cerulean Crystals, altering their once-mind appearance.\
The calm demeanor of turtles is never inherentit is actually a survival instinct to regulate body temperature and conserve energy. However, with the Eternal Summer erasing seasons, they no longer hibernate. The feral instincts, awakened by Cerulean Blight and reflected in the Cerulean Crystals on their shells, are devoid of all hints of their former gentleness.",
  ["13773"]="\"Hui the Serpent is three inches wide, its head resembling a huge thumb.\"\
Reptiles inhabiting the forests of Mount Tianque, now exhibiting metallic-black scales, unnaturally greenish bellies, and crowns covered in hardened scales due to the Cerulean Blight's influence.\
With the onset of the Eternal Summer, snakes start displaying primal tendencies to revert to ancient forms. Despite the impossibility of regrowing lost legs over millennia of evolution, they develop grotesque venom sacs and twisted, claw-like appendages.",
  ["13774"]="\"In the realm of Hanze dwells a bird much like a crane, with one leg, green plumes, and a white beak, known as Bifang.\"\
A colossal bird hovers above QingYu City, its beak as sharp as blades and its wings as vast as storm clouds. Beneath its tri-colored plumage lie metallic feathers, giving it the appearance of the divine crane from ancient myths.\
The ancient people of Qian revered Bifang as an omen of prosperity, believing that its presence promised peace and bountiful harvests. However, if such a primordial being truly survived from the dawn of time, the eons it enduredthe landscapes it witnessed, the solitude it borewould be beyond all human understanding.\
Every being harbors a soft spot in their soul for their homeland, even for Bifang. Perhaps it soared across the skies and journeyed thousands of miles... simply to reunite with an old friend.",

  ["14131"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Qian has long been home to many unique families, each with its own special craft, and Yuli hails from one such family of puppetmasters. However, Yuli remembers little of her past, having lost her memory in a tragic accident. Only her puppet companion Sue and her natural talent for puppetry provide clues about who she once was.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>With no living relatives and grateful for the kindness of Yuanquan, who took her in, Yuli chose to stay with Weishi as Yuanquan's personal bodyguard.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Like adding colors to a blank canvas, Yuli is discovering her new life while searching for the meaning of her existence alongside her companions in the Weishi.",
  ["14132"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Although Sue is not a living being, Yuli considers her a true friend, perhaps because the two have been inseparable since Yuli first regained her memories.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Sue is one of the few links to Yuli's past, and in many ways, she holds a wealth of knowledge about puppetry. It was Sue who helped Yuli rediscover the touch and skill needed to control and create puppets. Sue even remembers Yuli's birthday, her age, and her hometown. When Yuli visited the address Sue mentioned, she found the place abandoned, and no one knew what had happened to the mysterious family of puppetmasters.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Over time, Yuli has come to accept the reality of her memory loss. As she began to find her footing in CangLin City and started a new life, Sue played a crucial role. Whenever Yuli found herself in a pinch due to a lack of everyday knowledge, Sue would always provide the necessary information to help her navigate the situation. Sue even taught her how to manage household chores and cook, allowing Yuli to contribute what she could for the WeiShi members, earning their gratitude. \"Little Yuli is like our mom,\" Azi once remarked fondly, holding the hand-woven scarf Yuli had made for her.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Being able to help others brings Yuli great joy, and she shares these thoughts with Sue, even though Sue never responds like a real human. Every night, Yuli talks to her about her day before drifting off to sleep... After all, Sue is her dear friend!",
  ["14133"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>To a puppetmaster, puppets are like children to a mother. For Yuli, each puppet she creates holds special meaning. She always carries them with her, ensuring they blend seamlessly into the crowds as they move in unison.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>It is unclear who first created Sue, but Yuli suspects that Sue was crafted by someone from her ancestral line long before her birth and passed down through the generations until it reached her. Yuli has not yet mastered the skills required to create another puppet like Sue, but she can understand the feelings of Sue's original creator. Crafting even a small puppet takes countless hours of effort, so one can only imagine the dedication required to craft a powerful and intelligent puppet like Sue. It must have been like carrying a child for ten months, with every ounce of care and devotion poured into it.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Once crafted, a puppet becomes an independent entity. Even if the puppetmaster turns to dust or disappears, the puppet remains. This is why Yuli seldom parts with any of her puppetsshe desires to be with her \"children\" as much as she can during her limited life. Among all the puppets, her favorite is Sue, followed by a small puppet named \"Chuhuang,\" designed in his likeness, responsible for reconnaissance and communication.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Perhaps one day, someone might enter her life, occupying a place in her heart even more significant than a mother's love for her \"children.\" At that time, Yuli will craft a puppet, dedicating it as a gift to that person. Even as her own body decays, the puppet will forever carry their shared memories, preserving them until the end of time and beyond.",

 It reads:\
 I, Darius, the King of All Kings, blessed by a thousand gods, have erected this monument in memory of my deeds at the place where the great waterfall of the Memphis River cascades down.\
 I have conquered all the lands through which this river flows, I have lifted up the sun from its depths, and the borders of my empire have reached the southern end of the world.\
 I have pardoned all the prisoners of Memphis, provided that they obey my laws henceforth.\
 I have also given the warriors of the Immortal Army land and wealth of their choice.\
 I have freed slaves, relieved beggars, and sheltered the elderly, women, and children.\
 Let all the world know that I, Darius, the King of All Kings, blessed by a thousand gods, am a hero and a brave, merciful, and generous man.",

  ["15533"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>During the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten, his capital was the ancient city of Memphis, which was also known as the \"City of the Sun\" though it was actually an Anomaly located in the Memphis River Basin. According to ancient records, Ehtaton was a city floating on the \"Great River\"  though of course this could not be the real Memphis River. The river was wide and boundless, and a towering golden arch rose from its surface, spanning the sky above the city. A dazzling \"sun\" moved along the arch every day, rising in the east and setting in the west. Pharaoh Akhenaten called this the \"True Sun God,\" and its name was \"Aten.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Despite much opposition, Pharaoh Akhenaten moved the capital from Memphis - which, in the minds of the people, was the ancient capital of the gods - to here. It is said that Ehtaton was majestic and solemn, and the huge stones that made up its walls, palaces, and towers were so large that the craftsmen of Memphis were completely unable to cut or move them. The shapes of those buildings did not seem to be meant for mortals, but rather for beings much taller. Some documents that have survived to this day mention that the starry sky of Ehtaton was completely different from how it looked along the Memphis River. In addition, no records of the moon or its phases can be found in any documents related to Ehtaton, so it is difficult to determine which events in these documents occurred on which dates.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>But sometime during the later years of Akhenaten's reign, the city of Ehtaton inexplicably disappeared, as did the pharaoh himself and countless ordinary people in the city. Only a few people managed to escape back to Memphis, but the stories they told were difficult to believe. The priests of Memphis then sent people to investigate the location of Ehtaton, but they found nothing there except an endless stretch of yellow sand. Later generations therefore viewed Ehtaton as nothing more than a legend, and so it disappeared from the history books.",

Yet, the appellation \"Dragon Pillar\" appears to be a mere simplification stemming from the limited knowledge of ancient civilizations, for the true significance behind these designs remains an enigma to this day.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The anomaly caused by the Dragon Pillar is known as \"Cerulean Water\". In ancient times, Ji Xia enlisted a cadre of scholars to encase the water and the Dragon Pillar in bronze, averting the spread of the water's influence. These erudite individuals would later become the founders of WeiShi. Following the containment of the Cerulean Water and the Dragon Pillar, the First Emperor resumed his voyage, leaving the custodianship of the Dragon Pillar in the capable hands of WeiShi for millennia. The enigma surrounding this mystical relic even eluded the awareness of numerous subsequent emperors.",
  ["15602"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The ancient Qian Empire's thousand-year-old imperial capital was said to have been built by its first emperor Ji Xia and his close friend Li Jun, the \"Lord of Weaponry.\" It is located in the middle of Qian, built on Mount Tianque and overlooking the Grandeur River, giving it a significant geographical advantage. All of QingYu City is made of bronze, with indestructible doors and impregnable walls. It is said that after its completion, Li Jun laughed and clapped his hands, saying that even if he personally led his troops to attack the city, it would still be difficult to break through the city's defenses. During its subsequent history, the imperial throne of Qian was passed down from generation to generation, but the imperial capital never changed.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Modern archeology has confirmed that QingYu City has undergone many expansions. The palace that was built during Ji Xia's reign was the same palace on the top of the mountain and surrounding Tianchi Lake, which was ancient and solemn. It was the true core of the Qian Empire's power, the so-called \"Inner Palace.\" The emperor lived there on weekdays, and ministers also visited it regularly to pay homage and to discuss official matters. The imperial city outside the palace city was obviously a large-scale expansion, because its architectural style was significantly different from that of the Ji Xia era. It was used as a residence for royal relatives and important ministers, and the six ministries and other institutions - the so-called \"Outer Court\" - also worked there. What is puzzling is that given the levels of productivity at the time, it would have been almost impossible to complete such a large-scale expansion. Below the imperial city is the inner part of QingYu City, where the rich and middle-level officials live. This is also the most entertaining part of the city. Thousands of years ago, it was full of dance halls and singing stages, and even today it is still the location of many commercial streets and restaurants and stalls selling snacks. The outer city is closest to the foot of the mountain, which is where ordinary people lived.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>After the collapse of the Qian Empire, the newly born Qian moved the capital to Fengbei in the north to signal the beginning of a new era. QingYu City was fully preserved as a scenic spot and historical site. Today, there are many tourists who visit, with countless people going to the city every year to climb its heights and reminisce about its past.",
  ["15603"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The mausoleum of Ji Xia, the First Emperor of Qian.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>According to historical accounts, its interior supposedly boasted rivers of liquid mercury, a sky adorned with radiant pearls, and lanterns burning eternally with oil derived from mermaids... Despite these vivid descriptions, archaeological investigations have yet to uncover a mausoleum that matches the grandeur of the First Emperor's final resting place.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Various historical interpretations delve into the mysteries surrounding the Eternal Palace. One tale links the Xia dynasty's downfall to the opulent construction of the palace, which purportedly depleted resources and labor, hastening Xia's demise. Another legend speaks of a dragon descending from the heavens upon Ji Xia's passing to guide him and his kin to celestial realms, labeling the Eternal Palace as the \"Sacred Sanctuary\" in folklore.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The verifiable documentation within WeiShi explicitly acknowledges the existence of the Eternal Palace. Contrary to popular belief, this mausoleum is not Ji Xia's final resting place but a sanctuary nestled beneath Tianchi Lake in Mount Tianque, constructed during Ji Xia's reign to isolate the royal lineage from the mundane world. The Tianli clan was coerced by the imperial lineage to undertake the arduous task of constructing the Palace, mirroring the imperial palace above ground.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Upon the completion of the Eternal Palace, Ji Xia and his lineage vanished from the mortal realm.",
  ["15604"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Nong Ji was the founder of CangLin City and the first director of Canglin City's Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture. He single-handedly laid out the agricultural production pattern of what today is known as the Fertile Plains, and he also created the central agricultural production system.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>When he was young, he personally experienced the great famine in the western region and witnessed the tragic scene of thousands of miles of barren land and starving people, which deeply moved him. From then, he decided to devote his life to agriculture and worked on improving many high-yield crop varieties. His long-cherished wish was that there would one day be no more hungry children anywhere on earth. When Fengbei first proposed the plan to build CangLin City, Nong Ji volunteered to participate in the project and was appointed as the person in charge thanks to his academic achievements.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>After the completion of CangLin City, with his prestige Nong Ji could have easily directly served as the head of the CangLin municipal government, but Nong Ji resolutely declined this offer, saying that he only knew agriculture and was only willing to work in agriculture. So he continued to serve as the city's director of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture until his retirement.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Even after he retired, he was still highly respected and loved by the people of CangLin City, and the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture reserved for him the authority to enter the central agricultural production system. He returned the apartment for his retirement that CangLin City had allocated for him and instead moved to a house outside the city, a house that he and his comrades had built when Canglin City was first established. They had chosen that location because it was convenient for surveying both the fields and the Grandeur River. During the years of pioneering, it was once the command center for the CangLin City construction project.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Even though he was at an age when he should have been enjoying his retirement, Nong Ji still did not stop working. He opened up a large-scale experimental field near his house, constantly improving new varieties of crops. At the same time, he maintained close academic exchanges with universities and research institutions across the empire, doing his best to cultivate future generations.",
  ["15605"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Thousands of years ago, Li Jun, the first patriarch of the Tianli Clan, was a valiant warrior distinguished by his pioneering fusion of iron ore into weaponry, earning him the title of the \"Lord of Weaponry.\" From his era onwards, the chill of metal began to know the warmth of blood. It was during this time that Li Jun uncovered a peculiar green-hued metal in the waters of Mount Tianque, crafting weapons of unparalleled durability from it.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>When Ji Xia, the First Emperor of Qian, led his clan upstream, tensions escalated between the Ji clan and the Tianli clan atop Mount Tianque. Following a protracted stalemate, Ji Xia and Li Jun found themselves locked in a momentous one-on-one duel, a fierce battle that persisted until both were utterly exhausted. Subsequently, hostilities ceased, birthing an eternal friendship between them.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Together, they sought the origins of the mysterious metal from Mount Tianque, scaling the mountain to unveil Tianchi Lake and the anomaly within, later known as the \"Cerulean Water.\" While Ji Xia took a sip of the water, Li Jun, guided by his innate caution, refrained from drinking it.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Following the construction of QingYu City, Ji Xia embarked on a prolonged journey, appointing Li Jun as regent to govern the realm. In Ji Xia's absence, members of the Ji clan, driven by desire for immortality, recklessly consumed the Cerulean Water, succumbing to a corrosive transformation, both physically and mentally. They ultimately cast Li Jun as an unworthy outsider, unfit to rule over the Ji clan's domain, culminating in his execution.",

Throughout Xia's history, Ji Hong's legacy endures. Narratives paint him as either a valorous hero worthy of his lofty title or as a merciless figure who plotted against the Lord of Weaponry, ultimately executing him under the guise of justice. This event elevated the Ji clan to supremacy, fueling their avarice and eventually leading to their downfall.\

  ["15611"]="\"The emperor commanded that copper be mined from the Shou Mountains and had a great cauldron forged at the foot of Qingyu Mountain. When the cauldron was completed, a dragon descended from the sky, its long whiskers trailing close to the ground as it greeted the emperor before soaring back into the heavens.\"\
According to legend, this colossal creature had a body that seemed to blend with the mountains and bore the features of countless wild beasts. Its sheer size was said to rival that of a city, and its appearance closely resembled the dragons described in ancient mythology. It is said that Ji Xia, the first emperor, once laid eyes on the 'Dragon Vein', and after a long moment of silence, he broke into applause and laughter, calling it an auspicious sign. He then declared the place a land of immortals. \
Eons before humans existed, the world was ruled by a group of colossal beasts. Massive and ancient, their footsteps shook the earth, and their massive bodies loomed like mountains. Then a great cataclysm reshaped the world, reducing most of these titans to dust and burying their remains deep in the earth's crust.\
But what if... one of them survived? What if it escaped into a cavern and drank from the Cerulean Water? As time passed and valleys collapsed into tombs, the world above was reshaped by the ages. The cave became sealed deep within the mountains, yet the beast endured. Its scales, claws, bones, and flesh slowly turned the color of cerulean stone. With each metamorphosis, it grew larger and more grotesque until it became part of the earth's crust itself.\
Should this ancient behemoth ever awaken, it would boil Tianchi Lake with molten magma, summon storm clouds from above, and unleash a new cataclysm upon the land.",

  ["16019"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Phaenomena Kamitis is a member of the Delphic Oracle and the Dean of the Delphi Astronomical Academy.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Thousands of years ago, a \"Star\" descended into the Nereus Sea, ushering forth a bewildered blue-haired girl who traversed the parted waves onto the shore. The Delphic Oracle recognized her as an Anomaly and gave her a name, clothing, and an identity, granting her sanctuary within Delphi. Since then, each girl who accompanied her through the generations was given the name \"Aratos.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Research by the most recent Aratos suggests that Phaenomena is likely a lifeform comprised of gravity and gravitonsan existence beyond the reach of current human science. This also explains why starlight often glimmers in her hairher essence resembles a celestial body more than a being of flesh and blood. From a certain moment onward, the title of \"Dean of the Delphi Astronomical Academy\" became permanently hers, despite her obliviousness to the honor it carries.",
  ["1602"]="Character Voiceover Settings",
  ["16020"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Everyone at the Delphi Astronomical Academy knows that the dean does not actually handle administrative affairs. Still, like every other dean, Phaenomena has her own office. Although the vice-dean, who handles the actual work, has furnished the room with bookshelves, an armillary sphere, and other scholarly decorations, Phaenomena has never touched a single tome nor spun the delicate brass sphere. Within the office, her sole focus centers on the safe embedded in the wall. Once, due to lax oversight, a thief broke into her office and pried open the safe. Upon being caught, the thief confessed his deep disappointment with the Delphi Society, because the contents of the safe were merely a pair of rusted tuning forks.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>To Phaenomena, these simple toys hold immense value. Occasionally, she would strike the tuning forks herself to pass the long, idle hours. With the passage of time, the humble forks succumb to rust, their once resonant tones silenced, yet she preserves them with utmost care, securing them deep inside the safe.",
  ["16021"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Phaenomena's passion for sweets rivals her insight into the stars.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Legend has it that when she first emerged from the Nereus Sea, she remained indifferent to all \"offerings\" presented by the people of Delphiuntil a chef brought her a piece of candy, and only then did she finally smile.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>From that moment on, Phaenomena fell in love with all kinds of desserts. While she may have forgotten the myriad goods and shops in human markets, she could always recognize a cake shop or a bakery. Every generation of Aratos is allocated a dedicated \"dessert budget\" approved by the Grand Scholar, solely for satisfying Phaenomena's sweet tooth.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Of all the subjects imparted to her, culinary pursuits stirred the deepest passion within Phaenomena. However, within the vast world of culinary arts, her interest is limited to the art of crafting desserts. Naturally, due to her inherent clumsiness, every baking attempt ended in disaster. Rumors once circulated that the most terrifying weapon in the entire Delphi was not the Flame of Hephaestus from the Mechanics Academy, but Phaenomena's oven in the Astronomical Academy.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Despite her failures, it was after her first baking attempt that Phaenomena gradually began to understand the concept of \"friendship.\" Holding carbonized cookies, she offered them to the Aratos of that generation. \"Try it, my friend.\" Since then, a few students and professors have been \"fortunate\" enough to taste Phaenomena's creations.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Still, Phaenomena never quite understood why those friendsand those bakeriesalways melted away and vanished, just like the cheese she put in the oven.",
  ["16022"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Phaenomena often sensed an indescribable pull from deep within the starry sky, a sensation that humanity labored over for centuries to encapsulate in the term \"gravity.\" Much later, she stumbled upon the precise expression in human literature for that very feeling: \"homesickness.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The Delphi Society has long known that Phaenomena came from some distant \"other world,\" yet the nature of this realm eluded comprehension.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>In fact, the Delphic Oracle is more concerned with the \"Beacon\" that connects to that worldwhere is it?\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Anomalies inevitably follow their Beacon, an unbreakable law guiding their path.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Phaenomena unaware of this fact, and even if she did, she would struggle to express it clearly.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Anomalies typically pose risks to ordinary human existence. This realization has been reached through millennia of observation and bloodshed by C.A.V.E. Even when an anomaly appears harmless, it often harbors the potential to wreak havoc in the future. The longer it lies dormant, the more menacing its true essence becomes upon revelation.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Since ancient times, the Delphic Oracle deliberated on a question: when will Phaenomena, as an anomaly, eventually reveal her formidable side? And in what form will it materialize? Millennia have elapsed, yet she remains the same gentle girl, which only amplifies the Oracle's anxiety. When a coiled spring finally rebounds, unleashing the accumulated power stored over centuries, will the human realm endure its impact? Following Cyril's successful launch of the first artificial satellite, the Oracle even once proposed the idea of dispatching Phaenomena to Cyril and propelling her back into space via rocketfar, far from Earth.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, that proposal was staunchly rejected by the Aratos of that generation, akin to previous rejections of similar proposals. As the person who understands Phaenomena best, Aratos holds considerable influence over all decisions concerning her. Hence, to this day, Delphi remains Phaenomena's sole \"home\" in the human domain.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Yet, what will happen when this girl transcends mere \"homesickness\" and endeavors to \"return home\"? One renowned scholar once predicted that only then would the dreadful nature of the anomaly, known as \"Phaenomena Kamitis,\" be truly unmasked.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, if someone could constantly serve as her gravitational anchor, perhaps this star would stay, forever, for that person.",
  ["16023"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ariadne holds the esteemed position of the Grand Oracle at the Delphic Oracle and serves as the Second Grand Scholar of Delphi Academy.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Renowned as one of the most erudite individuals in the City of Wisdom, she displays an image of near omniscience to the outside world. Even within the Delphic Oracle, she stands out as the most prominent leader in centuries.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Traditionally, the roles of Grand Oracle and Grand Scholar are meant to be held by the same individual. However, recognizing her exceptional qualifications, the current Grand Scholar realized that managing the Delphic Oracle would only burden her. Hence, the Grand Scholar volunteered to assist her in everyday affairs, entrusting to her care the myriad anomalies and secrets beyond the mundane world.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Regarded as the foremost authority on anomaly research, Ariadne is often sought after for guidance by other members of the secret alliance when they encounter insurmountable challenges.",
  ["16024"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>According to standard procedure, the Delphi Medical Academy conducts annual physical assessments for members of the Delphic Oracle. Each member receives two medical reportsone \"tailored\" for public disclosure, and the other reserved for internal use only. Ariadne's confidential report contains the following note: \"Based on cortisol levels and EEG monitoring, the subject has endured consecutive years devoid of sleep. The extent of sleep deprivation proves to be fatal. However, all other physiological metrics remain within acceptable parameters. Continued monitoring is recommended.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>During a seminar on \"Life and Death,\" Ariadne once joked, \"I'll probably die from thirty thousand cups of coffee.\" Beyond caffeinated drinks, her greatest indulgence in daily life is bathing. Wielding her privileges as dean, she had an ancient-Delphic-style hot spring bathhouse built at the foot of Mount Mytikas for students of the Philosophy Academy. She frequents there herself as well, claiming, \"Bathing is the best substitute for sleep.\" Since students encountered her more frequently at the bathhouse than in her office, a tradition of communal soaking took root, evolving into the distinctive \"bathhouse philosophy seminar.\" When night falls, the mist, aglow with soft luminescence, carries the voices and thoughts of numerous thinkers skyward from the base of Mount Metikas toward the starlit sky.",
  ["16025"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ariadne usually maintains a demeanor of prudence and wisdom, yet she harbors a private fondness for dollsespecially ones that can be dressed up. On rare leisurely days, she tends to her dolls with a childlike enthusiasm, adorning them with new outfits and grooming their hair. When asked about this peculiar hobby, Ariadne once replied, \"The little girl in my heart has never truly grown up.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>To outsiders, this might appear as a philosopher's eternal innocence and curiosity toward the world, but members of the Delphic Oracle know the hidden truth. When the anomaly known as the Pallas Labyrinth of Reverie descends, ensnaring countless victims in its intricate web of chaos, only Ariadne possesses the ability to navigate its labyrinthine depths. In her dreams, she reverts to the form reminiscent of her pre-Oracle daysan image of a young girl with thick, golden locks that cascade around her form. She stands as the only recorded human to have ever escaped the Labyrinth's clutches. Years ago, she emerged from the forests of Mount Metikas, bewildered and haunted, speaking in a long-forgotten dialect of ancient Delphi. Upon translation, she claimed to come from an area millennia past, enduring a prolonged span of time within the Labyrinth that eluded even her own comprehension.",
  ["16026"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Among the leaders of C.A.V.E, Ariadne maintains a close connection with Cosmos, the former Head Librarian of the Library of Babel. Students from the Philosophy Academy often whispered that the Grand Oracle and the former Head Librarian were collaborating on a profound and enigmatic thesis concerning the origin of the worlda discourse so definitive that its resolution would mark the end of philosophy itself. While Ariadne neither confirmed nor denied these rumors, she admitted to maintaining a close correspondence with Cosmos. For reasons unknown, both insisted on using the least secure means of communicationplain letters sent through the regular postal service. A drawer in Ariadne's office houses a stack of envelopes, each stamped with the postmark of Obed. In response to persistent requests from C.A.V.E, Ariadne and Cosmos submitted their letters for review to ensure that no sensitive information was leaked. To the review committee's disappointment, the contents were cryptic, fragmented, and seemingly nonsensical, devoid of any discernible coherence. A few examples include:\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"What is the 'Shadow of Truth'?\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Does the 'Primordial Sun' exist?\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Which ends first, the labyrinth or the cave?\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ultimately, the committee concluded that these correspondences amounted to nothing more than philosophical musings detached from alliance affairs, permitting the continued exchange between the director and Grand Oracle. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Shortly before the collapse of the Tower of Babel and Cosmos's disappearance, Ariadne received one final letter:\

  ["2308"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>A type of mysterious substance that is scattered all over the world, its dimensions, form, look, and feel are all different, and sometimes it will even change depending on who observes it and how. The only thing it has in common is its color  a pitch-black color like a deep, dark abyss.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The era, origin, creator, and uses of these Beacons are all unclear. The only thing that can be confirmed for certain is that they appeared before the beginning of human civilization.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Where the beacon is located, an anomaly follows. A Beacon is either active or dormant, and when active it's easier for the Anomaly to descend. After a Beacon has become dormant, the Anomaly will then disperse. The principles of this are one of the main issues that each major secret alliance has been studying for a long time, but is still unable to completely decipher.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>When facing a Beacon, which brings about phenomena tantamount to miracles and revelations, most ancient humans saw it as being the existence of something like a holy object, or something to be built into an obelisk, suppressed under a temple, or poured into a stained glass window frame... Such behaviors can be seen both as a type of \"worship\" and a sort of \"sealing.\"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The history of the secret alliances is inseparable from that of the Beacons, and even today most Beacons are under the surveillance of the secret alliances. However, this vast history still has many Anomalies whose corresponding Beacons have not yet been discovered even today, and the secret alliances see it as an important task of theirs to always be searching for these unknown Beacons and concealing their existence.",
  ["2309"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Unlike the universe that humans know, there is a general term for things that should not exist, things that come to the world via the guidance of an active Beacon. Since Anomalies are impossible to understand, the only way that humans have of explaining them is to try to attach them to things they have already experienced. As a result, there are many myths, legends, stories, and anecdotes. \
 \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Fairly speaking, Anomalies might not necessarily have the intent to threaten humanity, akin to how lightning does not purposefully strike the innocent, and the ocean does not intentionally drown those who venture into it\
 \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, what humans often cannot understand are the reasons why danger occur. Before people understand what fire is, they only know that carelessly getting too close to it might result in death. Therefore, the secret alliances have done their utmost to keep Anomalies isolated and kept away from the general public so as to protect their compatriots.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The appearance and activity of Anomalies is present throughout history. Sometimes Anomalies are quickly covered up by the secret alliances, becoming nothing more than an inconspicuous record mentioned in a corner of some historical materials, and sometimes they become a major catastrophe that leads to a huge disaster, something that leaves riddles that remain unsolved to this day. Today, in the modern era of flourishing science and technology, Anomalies have been occurring noticeably less frequently, but strange things do still happen both on the internet and in the real world, and behind these is often the portent of unknown dangers.",
  ["231"]="Data",
  ["2310"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The guild leader of Eme-an, head librarian of the Library of Babel, the chieftain of Eme-an, the chair of C.A.V.E... all of these many titles are actually connected and refer to the same person. Of course, this list is only a small part of all the titles of the guild leader of Eme-an. The guild leader has the highest data authority of C.A.V.E.'s central information database, and can be in contact with all the intelligence of the Anomaly Control Alliance. Guild leaders have successively served as members of Eme-an, and all the confidential secrets they have organized from the Library of Babel can be seen clearly in front of them.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The first Eme-an guild leader was Elish, an ancient, legendary scholar whose image in historical materials was that of someone who was nearly omniscient. However, Elish did not leave behind any specific way of choosing a successor, and so in the long history after that Eme-an never formulated this sort of framework of rules and regulations. The reason for this is because the guild leader is seen as a wise man who leads all other wise men, naturally they are not bound by any trivial laws.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>In most situations, the guild leader is someone who is the most distinguished scholar of their time, though unfortunately being scholarly does not mean that one is well-suited to being a leader. Past guild leaders include many irresponsible people like Enki Tasny. Generally speaking, however, each secret alliance still views the Eme-an guild leader as their overall guru, and so they treat guild leaders with extra respect.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After the disappearance of Cosmos, the previous guild leader, the position of guild leader passed into the hands of \"Seer.\"",
  ["2311"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The earliest known Anomaly was discovered by Elish, the first guild leader of Eme-an. During his travels to seek the truth, Elish found the first-ever recorded Beacon in what today is known as the \"Land of the Roaring Lion\". After \"offering\" up a clay tablet to the Beacon, the Library of Babel descended, and then Elish began building the Babel Tower at the same location as a holy temple for the Beacon. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Currently, people understand the Library of Babel to be a building based on the space inside the Babel Tower, an endless maze formed through infinite exhaustion. In theory, one can find any arrangement and combination of the text from any book in the world.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, this infinite number of permutations and combinations of texts is but a drop in the ocean compared to the infinite nature of the library itself.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Imagine the process of a speck of dust on a bookshelf in some room drifting down.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>And imagine all the countless directions it might drift in before finally settling on the ground.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The library will create billions of new rooms surrounding the space, just to exhaust every possibility of where this speck of dust might fall.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The ways of forming connections between these rooms, their relative locations, and the relationships between their building structures are also part of an exhaustive list.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>This is something that human logic cannot understand, an infinite recursion that cannot be accommodated by a three-dimensional space, and an inconceivable anomaly achieved in dimensions beyond human cognition.",
  ["2312"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>During the reign of Emperor Thurinus of the Japheth Empire, An Anomaly of Ephrathah appeared on the east coast of the Philistine Sea. According to written records from the time, a brilliant lone star rose up from the middle of Ephrathah's night sky. Unlike other stars, which rotate along with other heavenly bodies, this star remained motionless high up in the sky of Ephrathah and could be seen clearly all along the coast of the Philistine Sea. Soon afterward, however, this newly born star disappeared, and it did not reappear again in any subsequent astronomical observation records. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The king of Ephrathah at that time was Herod, a man known for his cruelty and arrogance. Around the same time that the Star of Ephrathah appeared, there was a terrible fire in the city of Ephrathah, Herod's capital. The entire city was destroyed as a result, and Herod lost his life. The charred ruins of the city of Ephrath still remain today, having become a lonely ancient site out in the wilderness.",
  ["2313"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The elite soldiers of the ancient Obed ruler Emperor Darius always maintained a formation of 10,000 men. Whenever the troop suffered losses, warriors were immediately selected from other legions to supplement what had been lost. As long as there were people on the land of Obed who could fight, the army would not perish, which is how it came to be known as the \"Immortal Army\". \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The Immortal Army was full of heroes, including famous generals like Farhad. They followed Emperor Darius in his conquests and made great contributions to the vast territory of the ancient Obed Empire.",
  ["2314"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Its essence is not water, but a strange blue substance that dissolves in the water. According to the analysis of the Delphic oracle, this blue substance exhibits viral behavior, invades the cells of carbon-based hosts, and replaces cell components with a metal-based compound at the molecular level. In a way, this transformation is beneficial due to the hardens of the host's epidermis and bones, increasing its strength, and prolonging its lifespan almost infinitely, making it as immortal as metal. However, this transformation also has a huge impact on the nervous system of affected organisms. It stops all reproductive behavior, and infected embryos, eggs, and seeds will cease to develop. Animals will also experience phenomena similar to atavism and wildness, while humans will become slow-reacting.",
  ["2315"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>C.A.V.E. (Control Alliance of Visionary Eidos) is an alliance for controlling Anomalies and an organization formed by many existing secret alliances. With the development of technology and the globalization of society, the responsibility of watching over the dark side of history has become more vital yet more difficult than ever before. One single secret alliance is increasingly unable to cover up the existence of Anomalies on its own. Under the advocacy of Eme-an, each major secret alliance jointly established an alliance for controlling Anomalies. As the initiator of these efforts and the oldest secret alliance, Eme-an naturally became the leader of C.A.V.E. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>To show the sincerity of the alliance and facilitate cooperation and information sharing among its members, the C.A.V.E. Central Information Database was set up in the Babel Tower. This is the core of C.A.V.E.'s daily operations, with each major secret alliance exchanging intelligence and coordinating resources here to jointly protect their compatriots who are ignorant of the truth in the world.",
  ["2316"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>One can view Nemesis as both the old enemy of the secret alliances and the exact mirror image formed by the secret alliance throughout its long history. \"He who gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into him.\" Just as there are thousands of ways for people to understand the world, those who have the gift of seeing Anomalies have gradually developed differences in their understanding of \"watching over history\", and Nemesis is the poisonous fruit that is the final outcome of these differences.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The secret alliances believe that the steady progress of mankind and human history comes above all else, while the members of Nemesis believe that mankind should actively absorb the knowledge and technology brought about by Beacons and Anomalies without regard for the stability of civilization and society. When this rift in fundamental beliefs finally became irreparable, the secret alliances broke away with these people completely, and so these individuals subsequently formed their own organization - Nemesis, whose motto is \"If you do not take what God provides, you will suffer the consequences. All deeds have consequences, and all debts must be paid.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Compared with the secret alliances, Nemesis has few core members, but each of them is one with great influence in their respective fields. Some are politicians who dominate international affairs, while some are top elite intellectuals and entrepreneurs.\
 The organizational structure of Nemesis remains unclear and cannot be grasped, not even with C.A.V.E.'s ability. One can only vaguely understand that the core members of Nemesis are called \"Apostles\", with each Apostle having their own code name. Under these Apostles lies an intricate spider web of power and interests that has entangled countless people and organizations, many of whom do not even know that they serve the ancient enemy of the secret alliances.",
  ["2317"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The calendar currently used in countries around the world stipulates that the year when Cyril launched humanity's first artificial satellite into space is Year One. This is to commemorate the first time that humans saw the shape of the world with their own eyes, rid themselves of ignorance, and entered the modern age. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Coincidentally, it was also in the Year One of the World Calendar that navigators found the last undiscovered island in the ocean. From then, humans had a full understanding of the planet they lived. \
 Year One of the World Calendar was also a key turning point for the secret alliances. With the launch of the satellite, Eme-an, the Babel Tower, and the Library of Babel were all erased from the perception of the general public, marking the beginning of a new history.",
  ["2318"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>One of the most ancient countries with one of the longest histories of civilization reached its peak during the reign of Emperor Darius. Elish, the founder of Eme-an, discovered the Beacon of the Library of Babel in Obed, after which he built the Babel Tower at the location of the Beacon. The decline of ancient Obed is closely related to the mysterious disappearance of Emperor Darius. In his later years, Emperor Darius forced Eme-an to open the Babel Tower, but after entering, his whereabouts became unknown. After his disappearance, the empire quickly began to fall apart.",
  ["2319"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>A vast country in the northern part of the world, it is a union of many republican allies. Its capital is the Special City of Bolgruzlia, which means \"a heroic city full of glory and dreams\" in Cyrillic. Because this name is so long, it is usually shortened to \"Bogoria\".\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The city's cold climate gave rise to a heroic national character among the Cyrillic people. They built ports, factories, and railways with fiery passion, and one city after another has risen from the vast and desolate frozen land. The smoke from chimneys and the sparks from converters can be seen endlessly, day and night. These roaring machines and sweaty workers have jointly created what the world sees as an \"Iron Cyril\".\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>No other country has devoted as much energy and vision to the universe as Cyril has. Since launching humanity's first-ever artificial satellite, the Cyrillic people have enthusiastically planned the construction of space stations, orbital lifts, spacecraft, and even lunar bases, and have conducted many experiments for this purpose. They envisioned that Cyril would conquer the outermost reaches of the solar system on behalf of humanity and that the torrent of steel they had created on land would one day cover the starry sky.",

The standard city built by these four major companies is a modern wonder and the pride of the entire community. The skyscrapers lined up one after another to form a skyline like an artificial mountain range, almost able to touch the moon from the top. Life here is full of extravagant luxury and ruthless calculations.

During his rule, the powerful Japheth Empire in the west sent an expeditionary force, and Phraataces surrendered without much resistance. However, the expeditionary commander Rubicon somehow decided to spare Phraataces, return autonomy to the Arsacid Empire, and march back home.

Bronze statues, triumphal arches, and memorial columns are lined up on both sides of its main avenue, telling of the achievements that were made in the past as well as those that will be made in the future. This is only one part manifestation of the beauty of Japh's art.

  ["2327"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The oldest secret alliance that exists today, was founded by Elish, a legendary wise man. Elish discovered the first-ever recorded Beacon, the Library of Babel Beacon, in what would later be called the \"Land of the Roaring Lion, and he also built the Babel Tower there. Many scholars were attracted by the Anomaly that is the Library of Babel, and willing to accept the teachings and leadership of Elish. It was thus that Eme-an came into being.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The name Eme-an is a modern translation whose original writing and meaning are both extremely ancient. It is pronounced \"Em-eh-an\", which means \"divine mouthpiece\".\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>During its long history, Eme-an, with its knowledge, wisdom, and talents, formed a unique cooperative relationship with the rulers of the land of Obed. Successive rulers of Obed all respected Eme-an's unique character in exchange for the help of its wise men. Other than during Emperor Darius' reign, Eme-an rarely faced any direct threats, and it maintained a transcendent status throughout the rises and falls of history. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Since ancient times, Eme-an has maintained communication with secret alliances in every part of the world, guiding these relatively young people from a newer time in a mentor-like manner. The most classic example of this is the family of Florentine, whose ancestor Sarvis Florentine came into contact with Eme-an and learned of history's still-unknown dark side. During this process, Eme-an accumulated an extremely abundant amount of Anomalies and Beacon materials, and after C.A.V.E. was established, Eme-an became its fully deserving core. Intelligence from secret alliances and networks of collaboration revolved around Eme-an's opening up.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ever since the first year of the World Calendar, Eme-an has been erasing itself from public view and memory, fully retreating behind the curtain of history to become the most deeply hidden and thorough secret alliance.",
  ["2328"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The secret alliance that has watched over the history of Japheth for generations can be traced back to the earliest ancestor Sarvis Florentine, a famous general and Duke of Bellefontaine during the time of Emperor Thurinus. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The Florentine family clearly understood that only by first becoming invincible in the secular world would they be able to maintain their influence, and they also understood that in addition to power, there was one more thing necessary for getting things done: money. Therefore, the Florentine family got involved in the banking industry very early on, and even today the Bank of Florentine is one of the oldest and largest banks in terms of the scale of its operations. Only a giant like Polestar Conglomerate's Lead Credit Financial Group can compete. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The Florentine family also placed great importance on art, believing that beauty was the essence of Japhetic Ethics. Beauty was also an essential part of the lifestyle advocated by Japhetic Ethics, and with this philosophy in mind, the family's possession Bellefontaine has been managed from generation to generation turning the region into a massive work of art. Successive generations of dukes would passionately sponsor artists, inviting great masters to give lectures or stay, and to that end, they opened the Spring Institute, a place specifically dedicated to the cultivation of artistic talents. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Today, the person steering the giant weather-worn ship that is the Florentine family is the young duchess, Florence Florentine.",
  ["2329"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The leader of the secret alliance of Qian is known as Yuanquan or \"deep spring\", meaning they have vast knowledge like a spring that can guide all of WeiShi. This leader controls the Beacons on Qian's vast lands and is well-known in C.A.V.E. for their pragmatism, and their highest principles are the lives and safety of the people of Qian. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The history of WeiShi can be traced back to the early period of the Qian civilization, and it is said that their first emperor once consulted scholars regarding the origin of supernatural beings. The scholars solemnly replied, \"If you haven't asked about the common people, how can you ask about supernatural beings?\" The emperor then laughed loudly and never brought up the topic again. Thus, the spirit of WeiShi was created and has been passed down to this day. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, despite refusing the first emperor's inquiry, The scholars did not completely ignore the interest in supernatural beings. On the contrary, the sages of Qian had always wanted to get to the root of such inconceivable or unknowns. They maintain the stance that there is nothing in the world that cannot be explained, and if there is, then only because the ignorants lack understanding. Under the guidance of this simple, materialistic spirit, Qian scholars ultimately came into contact with the existence of Beacons and Anomalies, and that is how what later came to be known as WeiShi was gradually formed. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>During the long history of Qian, WeiShi is met with challenges. They were often suffering from constant war or deliberately suppressed by emperors or other powerful government officials, but WeiShi never once gave up on their responsibilities, instead struggling through situations tenaciously with wisdom. Other secret alliances would usually keep using the same name from the time of their establishment, but WeiShi knew that to continue protecting its beloved people, they would first have to protect themselves. So whenever a disaster occurred, they would divide themselves, concealing their name and changing their identity until the disaster had passed, at which point they reunited. The current name, \"WeiShi\", is the name that is used after the collapse of the old empire and the establishment of the new Qian. In past historical texts, members of WeiShi also adopted countless other names, but the one thing that never changed was their convictions and beliefs. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>In C.A.V.E., WeiShi is also the secret alliance that is most involved in worldly affairs, and even today in addition to their original responsibility of managing Anomalies, WeiShi also broadly participated in the construction of Qian, steadfast in its belief that the people living in these lands were worthy of a better life.",

  ["2330"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The Secret Alliance of the Delphi Academy is also the de facto behind-the-scenes of this academy-state and the Delphi Society. All those who are fellows of the Society and above are also members of the Delphic oracle. The head of the academy-state, the Grand Scholar of Delphi, is the leader of the Delphic oracle. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Long ago, Delphi was a land that nurtured rich mythology. At that time, many Beacons in Delphi were activated, but the rare occurrence was that most of the Anomalies that came to be could peacefully coexist with humans. Humans in this era of ignorance called them \"gods\" and granted with great respect. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>At a certain point in time, the Beacons of Delphi were closed one after another, and the people who originally served these \"gods\" fell into a state of confusion. So they began to look at the myths from a new perspective, trying to study why these \"gods\" came to the world and why they left. The collective they formed was the Delphic oracle. As their research progressed, the Delphic oracle gradually discovered that the true face of the Anomalies was completely different from the myth and full of dangers. Thus they consciously took on the responsibility of the Secret Alliance to protect their compatriots. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The Delphic oracle owns a large number of Beacons and Anomalies, which is due to Delphi's ownership of a large number of relics that survived from the era of myths. Many of them cannot be moved or collected, and some even cannot be \"sealed\" in the general sense - they can only be monitored continuously. This also leads to a high frequency of accidents in the Anomaly control work performed by the Delphic oracle, the highest accident rate in all of C.A.V.E. However, thanks to having such a large number of samples, the Delphic oracle has become an \"Anomaly and Beacon research institute\". \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Compared with the cautious attitude of other secret alliances, the Delphic oracle's research methods on Anomalies can even be called radical, and never hesitated the use of advanced technology. In ancient times, they once dared to use the large distillation system of alchemists to extract Anomaly products. In modern times, with electric power technology becoming accessible to all, the Delphic oracle had begun to wonder whether high voltage electricity could activate Beacons. After the invention of cutting-edge technologies such as nuclear magnetic resonance, tunneling microscopes, and mass spectrometers, the Delphic oracle was the first to move many inventions into the secret laboratory of the Delphic Society. Their boldness always shocked other secret alliances, but also recognized as the foremost authority on Anomaly research among all secret alliances.",

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The city of Japh is both large in scale and solemn, it is full of palaces and halls. Its most iconic buildings are the Holy Cardinal Nation Palace and the Palace of Japhetic Ethics. The Holy Cardinal Nation Palace was originally the imperial palace during the imperial era. After the beginning of the Holy Cardinal Nation era, the surrounding ramparts and moats were demolished and filled, replaced by magnificent, beautiful gardens. The Palace of Japhetic Ethics is a temple dedicated to Japhetic Ethics by the people of Japh. Its towering dome is painted with spectacular frescoes, and below it stands a huge monument engraved with the core \"Seven Laws and Seven Virtues\" of Japhetic Ethics. It is a place for the people of Japh to meditate, reflect, and place their spiritual life. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The Holy Cardinal Nation Palace and the Palace of Japthetic Ethics face each other across the Tiberius River. This river runs through the city, cutting Japh in half. The Shilepil Bridge spanning this river connects the two banks, symbolizing communication between the secular world and the spiritual one. The bridge is also the central axis of Javriel, which is densely covered with fountains, sculptures, monuments, and triumphal arches. Walking along this central axis, visitors will see the long history of Javriel unfolding before them like a scroll. Ancient heroes and glorious victories overlook the later generations from the tops of those monuments, striking the people with involuntary feelings of awe.",
  ["2332"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>During the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten, his capital was the ancient city of Memphis, which was also known as the \"City of the Sun\" though it was actually an Anomaly located in the Memphis River Basin. According to ancient records, Ehtaton was a city floating on the \"Great River\"  though of course this could not be the real Memphis River.The river was wide and boundless, and a towering golden arch rose from its surface, spanning the sky above the city. A dazzling \"sun\" moved along the arch every day, rising in the east and setting in the west. Pharaoh Akhenaten called this the \"true sun god,\" and its name was \"Aten.\"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Despite much opposition, Pharaoh Akhenaten moved the capital from Memphis - which, in the minds of the people, was the ancient capital of the gods - to here. It is said that Ehtaton was majestic and solemn, and the huge stones that made up its walls, palaces, and towers were so large that the craftsmen of Memphis were completely unable to cut or move them. The shapes of those buildings did not seem to be meant for mortals, but rather for beings much taller. Some documents that have survived to this day mention that the starry sky of Ehtaton was completely different from how it looked along the Nile. In addition, no records of the moon or its phases can be found in any documents related to Ehtaton, so it is difficult to determine which events in these documents occurred on which dates.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>But sometime during the later years of Akhenaten's reign, the city of Ehtaton inexplicably disappeared, as did the pharaoh himself and countless ordinary people in the city. Only a few people managed to escape back to Memphis, but the stories they told were difficult to believe. The priests of Memphis then sent people to investigate the location of Ehtaton, but they found nothing there except an endless stretch of yellow sand. Later generations therefore viewed Ehtaton as nothing more than a legend, and so it disappeared from the history books.",

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Even as early as the Japheth Empire, Bellefontaine was famous for its richness and beauty. Under the long-term management of the art-loving Florentine family, it became like an exquisite, magnificent art exhibition hall, with parks, squares, and statues everywhere. Bellefontaine is more like a garden where one can live than a city. Rivers, hills, woodlands, and lawns have become integral parts of it, and flowers are planted on the windowsills of every household. The color and appearance of Bellefontaine change constantly during each of the four seasons. Furthermore, each year is all different, as if the city is an oil painting that grows by itself with the passage of time. Therefore, Bellefontaine has earned the nickname \"Flower City\". \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The center of Bellefontaine is the old and elegant mansion of the Florentine family, where the Duke and his family live, receive visitors, and handle territorial affairs. Throughout the history of Japh, there were many decisive meetings that took place here. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, the most eye-catching part of Bellefontaine is not the Florentine family's mansion, but a magnificent building that has not yet been completed - the \"Flower City Cathedral\". The construction of the Cathedral has taken many years, and its scale is comparable to the Holy Cardinal Nation Palace and the Palace of Japhetic Ethics in Javriel while being even more beautiful. Architects describe it as \"an epic punctuated by marble\". \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>To cultivate and attract artists, the Florentine family established the Spring Academy, which has become Japh's art sanctuary and one of the most famous art schools anywhere. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>When talking about the Florentine family, of course one must also mention the Florentine Bank, which has a long history and still controls the economic lifeline of half of the world even to this day. The headquarters of the Florentine Bank Group is also located in Bellefontaine. In an era when multinational companies boast of their wealth with reinforced concrete and glass curtain-like walls, the Florentine Bank still adheres to past styles. Its headquarters maintains the classical style from when it was first built, which is consistent with the entire city of Bellefontaine and deeply reflects the ideas of successive generations of Florentine dukes governing the Flower City.",

It is a complex of buildings composed of a series of elegant modern structures. When the newly born Qian rebuilt the country on the ruins of what had come before, the square in front of Nongsang Pavilion was the starting point for the construction of CangLin City. It is therefore not an exaggeration to call this the \"origin\" of CangLin City.",

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>QingYu City, the old capital of Qian, was built on Mount Tianque.",
  ["2336"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The ancient Qian Empire's thousand-year-old imperial capital was said to have been built by its first emperor Ji Xia and his close friend Li Jun, the \"Lord of Weaponry.\" It is located in the middle of Qian, built on Mount Tianque and overlooking the Grandeur River, giving it a significant geographical advantage. All of QingYu City is made of bronze, with indestructible doors and impregnable walls. It is said that after its completion, Li Jun laughed and clapped his hands, saying that even if he personally led his troops to attack the city, it would still be difficult to break through the city's defenses. During its subsequent history, the imperial throne of Qian was passed down from generation to generation, but the imperial capital never changed. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Modern archeology has confirmed that QingYu City has undergone many expansions. The palace that was built during Ji Xia's reign was the same palace on the top of the mountain and surrounding Tianchi Lake, which was ancient and solemn. It was the true core of the Qian Empire's power, the so-called \"Inner Palace.\" The emperor lived there on weekdays, and ministers also visited it regularly to pay homage and to discuss official matters. The imperial city outside the palace city was obviously a large-scale expansion, because its architectural style was significantly different from that of the Ji Xia era. It was used as a residence for royal relatives and important ministers, and the six ministries and other institutions - the so-called \"Outer Court\" - also worked there. What is puzzling is that given the levels of productivity at the time, it would have been almost impossible to complete such a large-scale expansion. Below the imperial city is the inner part of QingYu City, where the rich and middle-level officials live. This is also the most entertaining part of the city. Thousands of years ago, it was full of dance halls and singing stages, and even today it is still the location of many commercial streets and restaurants and stalls selling snacks. The outer city is closest to the foot of the mountain, which is where ordinary people lived. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>After the collapse of the Qian Empire, the newly born Qian moved the capital to the Fengbei City in the north to signal the beginning of a new era. QingYu City was fully preserved as a scenic spot and historical site. Today, there are many tourists who visit, with countless people going to the city every year to climb its heights and reminisce about its past.",
  ["2337"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The residence where the ancient \"Tianli\" clan lived in Qian for thousands of years is located on the other side of Mount Tianque opposite QingYu City. It is said that it was personally given by the Qian Empire's first emperor Ji Xia to Li Jun, the first ancestor of the Tianli clan, to show that the Ji clan and the Tianli clan had been friends for generations and had a long-lasting friendship. After generations of expansion and renovation, the Tianli ancestral home's architectural style became unique and spectacular. Unlike QingYu City, which became a historical site, the Tianli people still live in their ancestral home. Therefore, foreign tourists who want to go there for sightseeing must first obtain the consent of the Tianli people. The new Qian also fully respects the ancient traditions of the Tianli people, allowing them to manage their homes on their own without any interference.",
  ["2338"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The lake at the top of Mount Tianque and in the center of the QingYu City Palace never freezes. It was regarded by ancient people as the \"place of dragon energy\" in Qian.

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The bottom of the lake is where the \"Beacon - Dragon Pillar\" is located. This Beacon can trigger \"Anomaly - Cerulean Water.\" After drinking it, living things will transform into living metal and gain a deformed \"immortality.\" Thousands of years ago, the first Qian Emperor Ji Xia and the first generation of Yuanquan personally sealed this Beacon, and ever since then, WeiShi has been secretly watching over the Tianchi Lake.",
  ["2339"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Legend has it that this is the burial place of the first emperor of Qian, Ji Xia, but its exact location is unknown. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>None of the history books have any mention of what happened to Ji Xia, so there have always been many different opinions about the first Qian emperor's final fate. Ever since thousands of years ago, there has been a legend that he secretly built a luxurious mountain mausoleum for himself during the last few years of his life that contained countless treasures, but the craftsmen who participated in its construction were executed and so there was no detailed information left behind. As a result, people from all dynasties have been keen to find the location of Ji Xia's tomb, but it has still never been found. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The more mainstream view is that the first emperor's tomb is located somewhere in Mount Tianque. Since the people of the Tianli clan are the oldest aboriginal inhabitants of Mount Tianque, every year the Tianli people are constantly being asked whether they know the location of the emperor's tomb, which the whole clan finds very annoying. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Some people say that the entrance to the first emperor's territory is in the center of the palace city at the bottom of the Tianchi Lake, but this area is forbidden to anyone, not of the imperial family, so no one can know for sure. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Although it is now the modern era, the attraction people feel toward wealth is something that will never fade. It is therefore likely that future generations will continue to search for the magnificent, secret mausoleum of the Qian Empire's first emperor, even if such a search is likely to be in vain.",

  ["2342"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The emperor of the Japheth Empire, known for his great talent and foresight, was recognized by later Japhetic historians as being the last and most outstanding ruler of the empire during its peak. During the reign of Emperor Thurinus, the empire's territory and the number of its vassal states expanded to an unprecedented level. As he proudly proclaimed, he had conquered every land that anyone had ever been to, seen, or heard of. In his hands, the \"Bricked Javriel\" became the \"Gilded Eternal City\". <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Emperor Thurinus was arbitrary and resolute, merciless to rebels and all others who resisted his rule, and consolidated Japh's rule with iron and blood. Even in his old age, he launched a war against the distant Arsacid Empire to try to seize the ancient \"sun god\" that was hidden there.",
  ["2343"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>During the reign of Emperor Thurinus, Herod was the king of Ephrathah, a small country on the coast next to the Philistine Sea. Ephrathah was one of the many vassals of the Japheth Empire. It relied on service and taxes in exchange for the protection of the Japhetic army. Herod regarded this as a great humiliation, but it was the best fate most countries could hope for at that time. Herod was eccentric and violent, often venting his anger on the servants in his court. Many of these servants came from distant Memphis and were descendants of the proud priests of the ancient pharaohs. Because Herod treated them inhumanely, the servants hated him to the core and had been waiting for an opportunity to take revenge. One day, a convoy that was returning to Javriel from the Arsacid Empire under the order of Rubicon provided them with this opportunity. They immediately recognized the ancient \"sun god\" described by their ancestors, and successfully encouraged Herod to get the Japhetic soldiers in the convoy drunk and awaken the \"sun god\". \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The star of Ephrathah then rose slowly, and although it would soon disappear, Herod, his servants, the palace, and the royal city were all destroyed by fire. No plants would grow on that scorched earth for many years afterward, becoming a footnote to the fate of that ambitious man.",
  ["2344"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The son of Thurinus was the key ruler who transformed the Japheth Empire into the Holy Cardinal Nation of Japh, as well as the commander of the Japhetic expeditionary force to the Arsacid Empire.

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After conquering the Arsacid Empire, he did not force its people to submit to the rule of Japh, but instead instructed Merari to take a more \"gentle\" approach. Soon after that, Rubicon issued an unusual order to withdraw troops and return autonomy to the Arsacid Empire and \"Eme-an\", though the reason for this was not recorded in any history books. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After the death of Emperor Thurinus, Rubicon, who succeeded him, implemented various reforms that brought about long-lasting and profound changes in Japhetic society that eventually led to the end of the imperial era and the beginning of the era of the \"Holy Cardinal Nation of Japh\". This period of history and Emperor Rubicon himself are still important research topics for historians today, and the doubts and controversies he stirred up remain disturbing even after his death.",
  ["2345"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Sarvis, the earliest ancestor that the Florentine family can trace itself back to, lived during the reign of Emperor Thurinus. Sarvis was a rising star who was promoted to the position of elder by virtue of his military exploits and was highly trusted. On the eve of the departure of the Arsacid Empire's expeditionary force, he was named the Lord of Bellefontaine, and ever since this ancient city has been governed by the Florentine family. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>During the expedition, Sarvis was the most important general of the expeditionary commander Rubicon and notched up many great achievements, and it was in the Library of Babel that Sarvis and Eme-an formed their initial relationship. Even after returning to Javriel, he also maintained private contact with Eme-an for a long time, and it was thus that the Florentine family was able to officially come into contact with history's dark side. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After Rubicon ascended the throne, Merari returned from seclusion and began to promote the \"Japhetic Ethics\" with Rubicon's support. Sarvis also spared no effort to participate. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Florentine family's power grew rapidly, and its roots soon extended to every corner of Japh. By Sarvis's later years, the Florentine family had become a secret ally of Japh, and consciously shouldered a similar responsibility as that of distant Eme-an: watching over the history of Japh. \

Before this expedition, Merari was a devout believer who did not believe in any other gods besides those of his faith, and he even sneered at the idea of Emperor Thurinus called the \"Sun God\". After returning from the expedition, Merari's behavior was completely different from before. He no longer participated in meetings of the Senate and stayed indoors for long periods of time. Only a few people such as Rubicon and Sarvis could see him. It was not until the death of Emperor Thurinus that he finally reappeared in the public eye, by which time Merari had become a passionate preacher. He preached a new spiritual tradition to the Japhetic people. It was easy to see the influence of past beliefs in it, but it also eliminated the worship of specific gods to a considerable extent and blurred the gods into more of a spiritual existence.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>This is what today is known as \"Japhetic Ethics\". Merari spent the rest of his life propagating the Japhetic Ethics, with the strong support of Rubicon, who by then was the new emperor of the Japheth Empire. Merari was therefore recognized as one of the important figures in the founding of the Holy Cardinal Nation era.",
  ["2347"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Emperor Darius was the ruler of the ancient Obed Empire, and during his reign, he expanded Obed to become the largest empire in the ancient world. His achievements impressed even the Emperor Thurinus, whose reign came later. However, after conquering Memphis in the south, Emperor Darius shifted his attention from governing his empire to trying to find ways to achieve immortality - in the last few years of his reign, this reduced him to the level of history's many other mediocre rulers. He did not hesitate to break the long-standing tacit understanding between the rulers of Obed and \"Eme-an\", and even openly went to war with Eme-an, forcing them to open the Babel Tower and allow himself and his guards to enter it to search for books that might hold the secret of immortality. After that, however, the great ruler Emperor Darius mysteriously disappeared from the history books and no one ever saw him again, alive or dead. There are many different theories about what might have happened to him, but none of them are convincing.",
  ["2348"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Farhad was a personal guard of Emperor Darius who belonged to the \"Immortal Army\", the ancient Obed Empire's most elite force. He fought bravely during the conquest of Memphis and received Darius's favor. In Darius's old age, Farhad was ordered to capture Pythagoras, the head of Eme-an, and storm the Babel Tower. He followed his master into the tower to look for the secret of immortality, but after that, both he and Emperor Darius disappeared from history.",
  ["2349"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Pythagoras was the guild leader and the head of \"Eme-an\" during the reign of Emperor Darius. Based on his own research he proposed that the world was spherical, and even persuaded Emperor Darius to accept this theory. After conquering ancient Memphis, Darius transported its \"Sun God\" - a mysterious huge copper sphere - back to Obed and handed it over to Eme-an for research, hoping that Eme-an could use this ancient material to find a way to make mortals immortal. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, Pythagoras disappointed him, and ten years later Eme-an still knew very little about the copper sphere. Darius, who by that time had run out of patience, believed that Eme-an was unwilling to cooperate. So he ordered the cancellation of the protection of Eme-an, and as a result, many members of Eme-an were captured and killed by the Immortal Army. The last known historical record of Pythagoras showed that he had been imprisoned in a dungeon, but his name could not be found on subsequent lists of executed and released prisoners. Therefore, Pythagoras also became part of the unsolved mystery of ancient Obed, just like Emperor Darius.",

  ["2350"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Feng Lin, the director of CangLin City's Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture, was young and capable, kind to others, and respected by his colleagues. When Qing lost her temper at a meeting of the CangLin municipal-government, Feng Lin was the only one who could control the situation. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>His resume was unmatched by anyone in the entire CangLin municipal-government. He graduated from college at the age of 19, obtained a doctorate in agronomy at the age of 22, and then was admitted to CangLin City's Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture after attaining first place in the written test. He could have directly taken a management position, instead, he took the initiative to request that he rotate through and study in various agricultural and breeding farms for three years, after which he returned to the CangLin municipal government at the age of 25. After this rotating study, Feng Lin had become familiar with all aspects of CangLin City's production. During this period, he humbly asked Nong Ji, the former director of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture, for advice, which he used to improve many management processes and production measures. Nong Ji was impressed by this rising star, and so when he retired he personally recommended Feng Lin to be his successor, even though at the time, Feng Lin was not yet 30 years old. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>His colleagues in the CangLin municipal-government generally believed that he would be the next director, and while it was even possible that he might enter Jiangyin Pavilion, it was unknown whether he might even be promoted to the Wellbeing Office in the future.",
  ["2351"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Nong Ji was the founder of CangLin City and the first director of Canglin City's Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture. He single-handedly laid out the agricultural production pattern of what today is known as the Fertile Plains, and he also created the central agricultural production system. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>When he was young, he personally experienced the great famine in the western region and witnessed the tragic scene of thousands of miles of barren land and starving people, which deeply moved him. From then, he decided to devote his life to agriculture and worked on improving many high-yield crop varieties. His long-cherished wish was that there would one day be no more hungry children anywhere on earth. When Fengbei City first proposed the plan to build CangLin City, Nong Ji volunteered to participate in the project and was appointed as the person in charge thanks to his academic achievements. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>After the completion of CangLin City, with his prestige Nong Ji could have easily directly served as the head of the CangLin municipal government, but Nong Ji resolutely declined this offer, saying that he only knew agriculture and was only willing to work in agriculture. So he continued to serve as the city's director of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture until his retirement. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Even after he retired, he was still highly respected and loved by the people of CangLin City, and the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture reserved for him the authority to enter the central agricultural production system. He returned the apartment for his retirement that CangLin City had allocated for him and instead moved to a house outside the city, a house that he and his comrades had built when Canglin City was first established. They had chosen that location because it was convenient for surveying both the fields and the Grandeur River. During the years of pioneering, it was once the command center for the CangLin City construction project. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Even though he was at an age when he should have been enjoying his retirement, Nong Ji still did not stop working. He opened up a large-scale experimental field near his house, constantly improving new varieties of crops. At the same time, he maintained close academic exchanges with universities and research institutions across the empire, doing his best to cultivate future generations.",
  ["2352"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ji Xia was the first emperor of Qian and the leader of the ancient Ji clan. According to historical records, he led the Ji clan up the Grandeur River, conquering all the way, and by the time he arrived at the foot of Mount Tianque, he had created a huge empire without historical precedent. It was there that he met his lifelong rival Li Jun, the first ancestor of the Tianli clan. The two fought to a draw, but neither of them could emerge victorious they eventually gave up and made peace, finally becoming close friends. The Tianli clan and the Ji clan then ruled the world together, creating the ancient civilization that the world today knows as - \"Qian.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ji Xia established the capital of his empire at Mount Tianque and built QingYu City, after which he then handed over the control of state affairs to his close friend Li Jun, the \"Lord of Weaponry.\" Historical records then show that he set out to travel, but his whereabouts were unknown. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>As the first emperor in Qian's thousand-year history, his mysterious disappearance has been much talked about by later generations. There are many unofficial histories and legends, but their credibility cannot be verified. \
 People believe that he tasted every plant on earth during his travels, telling people which plants can be planted, which can be used as medicine, and which are poisonous. Therefore, he is worshipped as the first ancestor of agriculture and medicine and is widely loved. Some places even regard him as a god and call him Zulong, or \"ancestral dragon,\" saying that he actually drank the water from the Tianchi Lake and turned into a dragon. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>To this day, there is still a legend in QingYu City saying that if a stranger from afar knocks on one's door at night and asks for a bowl of wine, one should never refuse because it could be that Ji Xia has finally returned.",

  ["2936"]="The red-haired girl grumbles while digging into her rice bowl. Zero and I sit at the other end of the table, struggling to find our appetites.",
  ["2937"]="Dear residents of CangLin City, I am Ji Lanqing, Zhi Jing of the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity.",
  ["2938"]="Dear residents of CangLin City, I am Feng Lin, head of the CangLin municipal government's Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture.",
  ["2939"]="Don't do anything reckless, and don't get hurt. Promise me... you must you must take care of yourself.",
  ["294"]="Tap anywhere to confirm",
  ["2940"]="Behind the fog, a huge silhouette is approaching.",
  ["2941"]="\"Come on, let the fight between hunters begin!\"",
  ["2942"]="I opened my eyes, and what came into view was still that familiar figure.",
  ["2943"]="The moon is in the sky, bright as a mirror that flies.",
  ["2944"]="I will chop off the dragon's feet and chew on its flesh so that it cannot turn back in the morning nor lie down at night. Naturally, the old will not die and the young will not cry.",
  ["2945"]="\"If we all let our guard down, how can we possibly fulfill our duty to protect our fellow people?\"",
  ["2946"]="\"If we allow the Cerulean Blight to spread, it will not be long before the evolution of the entire biosphere, which has lasted for billions of years, gets put on hold.\"",
  ["2947"]="I hope this kid will grow up in a better world. Do you think it will?",
  ["2948"]="So when exactly will you come here to save us?",
  ["2949"]="This title originated from Ji Xia, the first emperor of Qian and the ancestor of agriculture. It is used to praise people who have made great contributions to agriculture, as if they were reincarnations of Ji Xia himself.",
  ["295"]="Back",
  ["2950"]="That year, CangLin City had just been completed and the first-ever grain-transporting train to depart from Canglin City Station had just left, carrying newly harvested rice and wheat to far-flung western regions.",
  ["2951"]="\"Pi, you should get some rest.\"",
  ["2952"]="The blue color mixed with the rain caused her face to gradually fill with despair.",
  ["2953"]="...Make sure you grow up strong and healthy.",
  ["2954"]="\"You did very well, no one could possibly be better.\"",
  ["2955"]="The dust wandering alongside the comet finally concludes its long journey, falling into the starry sky under the pull of gravity.",
  ["2956"]="Before your eyes are balloons, fireworks, cake, and mountains of gifts, with a birthday song softly playing in the background.",
  ["2957"]="Upon receiving permission, a dark figure enters, holding a box in his hand.",
  ["2958"]="Dad, you were right. After all this time, I've finally found my own path.",
  ["2959"]="Like a cornered beast, she seeks to display her final defiance even amidst injuries.",
  ["296"]="Instant settlement",
  ["2960"]="I am Tansy, a descendant of the Tang Clan.",
  ["2961"]="Many ingenious mechanisms were created as weapons of war, but in the end, they only brought more suffering to Qian.",
  ["2962"]="Perhaps tomorrow, you'll see it. Or perhaps, you'll never see it again...",
  ["2963"]="If I ever see it again... I'll make sure to catch it this time...",
  ["2964"]="With a forceful pull, the twin swords are drawn out, their blades slicing through flesh, yet the sensation is like pulling a long-decayed broken sword from the earth.",
  ["2965"]="The roar that the giant bear couldn't release turned into a whimper in its throat, as if it were intimidated. It climbed the wall and quickly retreated into the dense forest.",
  ["2966"]="Gazing upward, the starry expanse stretched endlessly. The sky seemed unreachable, yet in that moment of reverie, fireflies drifted past, crossing over from the creek's edge.",
  ["2967"]="\"I only slack off once in a while, just cut me some slack.\"",
  ["2968"]="Cross mountains when you encounter them, and ford rivers when they arise. Shatter any boulders in your way, and burn through thorns that block the path. Kill any beasts that stand in your way, and treat people as obstacles to be cleared. To me, the challenges of the world are no different from this.",
  ["2969"]="A sharp, clear whistle suddenly cut through the misty twilight of the forest, interrupting the conversation.",
  ["297"]="Checkpoint",
  ["2970"]="A group of dark figures appeared on the distant hillside. In the fading light, the figure at the front stood out, towering over the rest.",
  ["2971"]="It's the hum that rings out when the blade and sword meet for the first time",
  ["2972"]="This is our fourteenth encounter. So far, we've had 3 draws and 11 defeats, but no victories... The Ji family has never experienced such a devastating loss before.",
  ["2973"]="The young man flipped the broken half of the arrow shaft, and the greenish gleam of the arrowhead swept across his pupils.",
  ["2974"]="Come on, lift it up as high as you can! Hey, hey, little sister over there, give us a smile! You can use your hand to lift the corners of your mouth. \
 Anything worksjust don't keep that straight face!",
  ["2975"]="Bones, blood, and the battlefieldthese are nothing new to the people of Tianli.",
  ["2976"]="It was autumn, and beneath the snow-capped peaks, there was no warmthonly the biting cold wind. \
 Along the rugged mountain path, a small black figure moved slowly, walking alone.",
  ["2977"]="The Ji Clan's territory is vast, and their forces are numerous. We may suffer countless defeats, but one victory against you will be enough. You might win many battles, but a single loss could spell your complete downfall.",
  ["2978"]="The sound of their clapping hands, like the beat of war drums, echoed through the mountain gorge.",
  ["2979"]="The noodles are perfectly chewy, and the broth is absolutely delicious! I'll have another bowl, please!",
  ["298"]="Rewards claimed",
  ["2980"]="Its eyes gleam with a warm red hue in the moonlight, akin to fireflies or stars.",
  ["2981"]="The duel has lasted for three full days, yet the opponent shows no sign of fatigue.",
  ["2982"]="Without hesitation, both of them dropped their broken blades and raised their fists at each other.",
  ["2983"]="This oath shall remain unbroken. Whoever breaks it will be cursed by heaven and earth!",
  ["2984"]="We're not even halfway there yet.",
  ["2985"]="As dusk slowly descended from the clouds, the view here stretched across a hundred-mile radius, extending all the way down the mountain.",
  ["2986"]="It glanced at the lake, as if considering a sip of water. But after another look at the motionless Ji Xia, it tucked its long beak under its wing and began preening its feathers.",
  ["2987"]="At the twinkle of an eye, Ji Xia had already raised the cup to his lips and drank it all in one gulp.",
  ["2988"]="From then on, this word came to be used as the title for the ruler of all the people in the world.",
  ["2989"]="Cang Luo held something in both hands, presenting it to Ji Xia. Taking a closer look, he saw it was a seal carved from fine jade. The craftsmanship was slightly rustic, but the design exuded strength and elegance.",
  ["299"]="Time freeze",
  ["2990"]="That night, the sound of the flute was long and melodious, swirling through the beams and blending with the rustling of the pine trees in the moonlight, as if resonating with the \"harmonious response between heaven and man\" spoken of by future generations.",
  ["2991"]="The figure in the carriage sat upright, adorned in ceremonial robes with a crown upon their head. Sunlight pierced through the clouds, casting a golden glow ahead of the carriage and illuminating their face.",
  ["2992"]="The pristine attire made them feel as if they had become a completely different person.",
  ["2993"]="Various positions were established to oversee different aspects of governance and society. The Minister of Agriculture was tasked with overseeing farming and sericulture. The Minister of Education was responsible for teaching and moral guidance. The Chief Justice was in charge of laws and legal disputes. The Minister of Labor supervised all forms of craftsmanship. The Minister of Rituals was in charge of ceremonies and sacrifices. The Minister of Forestry and Wildlife was responsible for plants, trees, and animals. The Minister of Music oversaw the arts and culture. Finally, the Minister of Counsel was entrusted with providing advice and guidance.",
  ["2994"]="With ceremonial drums and the passing of the baton in dance, like spring orchids and autumn chrysanthemums, their beauty endures through the ages.",
  ["2995"]="The two of them stood in silence, gazing down at the vast rivers and mountains below Tianque Mountain.",
  ["2996"]="I swear, in the name of the \"Lord of Weaponry\", \
 I will spare no effort and leave no stone unturned in fulfilling the emperor's trust in me.",
  ["2997"]="Wherever he went, pleas for help echoed from every direction.",
  ["2998"]="He chased elk and birds through the forest, navigating narrow paths and streams overgrown with wild grass. He ate grass and fruit to stave off hunger, drank from the wind and dew to quench his thirst, no longer keeping track of distance or time.",
  ["2999"]="All was silent, with heaven and earth offering no sound. His gaze met only the moon reflected in the water, and his question faded into the stillness, unanswered.",

 Don't forget that even Elish, the founder of Eme-an, also once used to be just an ignorant fool.",
  ["338"]="40d 12h",
  ["3380"]="These incomplete books are fragments of lost chapters in the long history of Eme-an, and they are quite intriguing. Reading them can enrich your knowledge.\
 Elish, the first Head Librarian of the Library of Babel, had just completed the longest journey in the world, but he warned future generations that even his entire journey was nothing more than just a short corridor in the library.",
  ["3381"]="These well-preserved books contain much extraordinary wisdom from that strange library, enough to be passed down to future generations. It is profound and difficult to understand, though after reading it you will suddenly be enlightened.\
 Countless people have tried to emulate Elish. Some have returned with a lot, while others have gained nothing. The library is at once both the most generous of treasure houses and the most barren of wastelands.",
  ["3382"]="The cover of this book is extremely complex, but the pages inside are completely blank. The content varies from reader to reader, and cannot be summarized in words, but reading it can give you sudden enlightenment. \
 At the end of his journey, Elish embraced his ignorance once again and left these words: \"I have never once made any footnotes of books, but plenty of books have made footnotes of me\".",
  ["3383"]="This candle, lit to commemorate the first spark created by striking stone on wood, is the oldest original intention of craftsmen and can make weapons a little sharper.",
  ["3384"]="This flame has baptized countless swords and shields and forged the ancient doctrines of the Delphic War Academy.\
 Use it to forge weapons and make them stronger.",
  ["3385"]="These savage, unbridled flames require steel and gears to contain their power, and they roar greedily at all times, always seeking more fuel.\
 If they are guided well, they can completely transform weapons.",
  ["3386"]="After burning for countless years, this eternal fire finally became restrained again. Like a star, it no longer needs to use time to prove its Clarity.\
 And as for the weapons that it tempered, they can touch the edge of eternity.",
  ["3387"]="Even going all the way back to the beginning of civilization, our ancestors had recorded the story of Qingyan, or blue rock. They followed the banks of the Grandeur River, picked up the remains of rocks that had been washed clean of their shells, and used them to forge tools. The remaining ashes came from green tiles or swords and spears. They flowed in the breeze and remained present on the earth, witnessing the rise and fall of Qian together with the people of this land.\
 By putting these tools into a forge, one can forge strong and durable weapons.",
  ["3388"]="From the vastness of the mountains, QingYu City emerges. As they walked along these vast mountains, stonemasons broke the hard rocks and selected bluish-gray gravel. Cart after cart of these stones were transported to the thousands of forges in QingYu City, where they were cast into treasures and pavilions to build this bronze imperial capital. \
 By putting these materials into a forge, one can forge them into exquisitely crafted weapons.",
  ["3389"]="There was once a very special piece of blue rock near Tianchi Lake. The stone was huge, but also indestructible and unbreakable - even the blade of an axe could not damage it.\
 However, it was eventually abandoned outside the city and regarded as waste stone. Countless numbers of craftsmen and stonemasons came to this place to build settlements, and after several generations of carving, hammering, polishing, and tempering, this piece of jade was able to shed its rock shell and regain its brilliance.\
 The blue palace that was cast using this blue rock has long since disappeared, but the skills and stories of polishing and tempering it are still passed down by the people.\
 When put into a forge, this rock can be cast into unparalleled famous artifacts to be handed down from generation to generation.",
  ["339"]="Warm up",
  ["3390"]="The green plants growing in the Library of Babel were originally commonly found plants in Obed, but their growth cycles have since been disrupted. Even after growing for several years, these plants do not bloom or bear fruit - instead, they are an exhaustive combination of growth and degeneration. \
 If one grinds its branches and leaves, the juice can be used to restore ancient things.",
  ["3391"]="If the time scale were extended, some plants would indeed jump out of the vortex of germination and degeneration and actually grow real, plump buds. Affected by the disorder of the growth cycle, these buds flower for only a very short time and will wither and die at almost the same time as they bloom. \
 If one grinds these buds, the juice can be used to restore ancient things.",
  ["3392"]="Only a very small number of branches and leaves can continue to grow after flowering and produce fruits that never wither. As for why they bloom and bear fruit, it is probably because these plants have gone through countless arrangements and combinations until they finally exhausted them all and found the correct growth cycle through which to achieve a special form. \
 If one grinds the fruit, its juice can be used to restore ancient plants.",
  ["3393"]="It is said that when the Babel Tower was first built, the first cornerstone to fall there was the solid moonlit ore. To some extent, that also symbolizes the cornerstone of the world - at least, the world that people knew at the time.\
 When you hold it, it will make you think of new questions about things you already know.",
  ["3394"]="After the Babel Tower began growing up toward the sky, bloodstone was used to decorate the halls within. According to various ancient anecdotes, bloodstone is also a key material for building the entire world.\
 When you hold it, it will give a different perspective on things you already know.",
  ["3395"]="Press this cylinder into the mud and roll it once, and a gorgeous, fully intact pattern will be printed.\
 It is said that the cylinder's seal hints at the true appearance of the world, or at least one of its true appearances.\
 Before the construction of the Babel Tower stopped, people were saying that when it finally touched the sky, its tip would be the foundation of a tower buried deep underground.\
 When you hold this cylinder, it can give you a completely different answer about something you already know.",
  ["3396"]="In non-emergency situations, most secret alliances adopt a supply strategy of \"adapting to local conditions\" - which means that their members purchase supplies according to their own personal circumstances.\
 \"Remember to get an invoice or a receipt, otherwise you won't be reimbursed\".",
  ["3397"]="When encountering a situation that cannot be solved by purchasing something on their own, members can submit a supply request to their secret alliance, and then patiently wait for delivery by local logistics.\
 \"Why local logistics? Ahem...well, if you want to hide a leaf, the best way to do that is to put it in a forest, of course...\"",
  ["3398"]="In an emergency, members usually contact the secret alliance base located in their area to apply for special supplies. Depending on the region, they will often receive supplies with local characteristics.\

  ["3401"]="Like a celestial body the size of a fruit in the palm of your hand, it can continuously emit light.\
 This light diffuses like mist and is like a nebula that breeds stars. The vast unknown is like a promise to people's thirst for knowledge, but also a warning to people's curiosity.",
  ["3402"]="Like a celestial body the size of a fruit in the palm of your hand, it can continuously emit light. \
 The stars may be shining, but deep space is still dark as if to provide evidence that the unknown far outweighs the known. Don't stop just because the light is reassuring, and don't retreat just because the light will eventually disappear. Remember that even now, the first ray of light from the very beginning is still moving toward the edge of the universe.",
  ["3403"]="This test tube contains the \"original liquid\" extracted from the legacy of the \"Delphic Gods\" by the Delphic oracle. It is said to come from the primordial and is the earliest example of changes in the form of matter. \
 After using it, you will gain a whole new understanding of the form of \"water\".",
  ["3404"]="During the expedition of the Japheth Empire, the sages of Delphi commissioned the Florentine family to offer treasures as a token of submission. This dust contains the light of an invisible fire, the earliest form of power required by the tangible world.\
 After experiencing it, you will gain a whole new understanding of the form of \"fire\".",
  ["3405"]="After inheriting Cyril's ancient data, KSOIR discovered many unexplained phenomena, one of which being the disassembled wire. He found that the wire could cause the interactions between particles to stop and even break off.\
 After more observation, it is possible to generate a new understanding of the form of \"thunder\".",
  ["3406"]="After the Helios Corporation launched a space laboratory, it then collected a strange tetrahedral light source at the edge of outer space. The faint light it emits cannot be located on the electromagnetic spectrum, and it seems to be beyond the laws of physics that are known to humans.\
 After witnessing it, you will gain a whole new understanding of the form of \"light\".",
  ["3407"]="The Cyril Aeronautics Department collects special particles through space probes carried by outer satellites. These particles were first accidentally discovered through proton spectrum analysis. They cannot be detected by any optical instruments, and seem to be beyond the laws of physics that are known to humans. \
 After gaining more insights into this, it is possible to generate a whole new understanding of the form of \"darkness\".",
  ["3408"]="Once it contains a certain amount of the original liquid, the liquid in the container can rotate continuously even without any external force. The freezing and melting caused by the seasons and the phase changes across critical points are only appearances. It is only by accident that it was named \"water\" in our world. Outside our world, it has a far wider range of commonalities.\
 After using it, you will gain a whole new understanding of the form of \"water\".",
  ["3409"]="When these embers of energy gather to become a certain size, the fire in the lightbox can then be re-ignited. The light and heat seen by the naked eye as well as the tiny and complex movement visible at the molecular level create an abstract, deeper commonality, and it is truly accidental that this came to be called \"fire\" in our world. \
 After experiencing it, you will gain a whole new understanding of the form of \"fire\".",
  ["341"]="Collectibles",
  ["3410"]="By wrapping the disassembled wire into a special coil and coordinating it with a field generator, the disassembled electrical charges can be forced to merge and burst out of disassembled electric arcs. This can cause microscopic matter to decompose and disintegrate, suggesting that the nature of disordered entropy increases. It is purely accidental that this came to be called \"thunder\" in our world.\
 After more observation, you will gain a whole new understanding of the form of \"thunder\".",
  ["3411"]="By gathering and welding tetrahedral stardust into a cube, a brighter light source can be obtained. Relativity, duality, the upper limit of macroscopic speed... theoretical research on tetrahedral light sources has set up one boundary after another to formulate the theory of how to explain the universe. It is only by accident that this phenomenon came to be called \"light\" in our world.\
 After witnessing it, you will gain a whole new understanding of the form of \"light\".",
  ["3412"]="Collected particles are placed in a special instrument, and the material entity is obtained after breaking the critical value. The particles themselves exist objectively and are likely one of the components of the universe, but they cannot be observed through conventional means. It is only by accident that this phenomenon came to be called \"darkness\" in our world.\
 After gaining more insights into this, you will have a whole new understanding of the form of \"darkness\".",
  ["3413"]="When a large amount of the original liquid is injected into the reactor, the liquid in the reactor will then generate a new form in an intense reaction. After extensive debate, the Delphic oracle finally reached a preliminary conclusion: The contents of the reactor act as a breeding ground for new living things. \
 After using it, one can obtain new insights into the theory of \"water\".",
  ["3414"]="Use this energy-containing spark to ignite the special medium. After completing this self-sustaining continuous reaction, the flames will then rise from the forge. Even after thousands of years of research, the Florentine family still does not understand its form, and can only make cautious and humble judgments: The energy in this dust is an indispensable element for developing and changing the material world.\
 After experiencing it, you will gain a whole new insight into the form of \"fire\".",
  ["3415"]="The product of combining the disassembled coil with the field amplifier can multiply the disassembled electric arc. It is enough to cause macroscopic objects in a wide area to collapse and disappear. Therefore, KSOIR 0 Directorate issued urgent instructions: Humans are not ready to come into contact with things that represent destruction and the end of the world. And until they are, no one should be allowed to conduct any further research.\
 After more observation, it is possible to generate new insights into the form of \"thunder\".",
  ["3416"]="By aggregating hexahedral stardust and pressurizing it to a critical state, an octahedron emitting a strong light source can be obtained. But even a bold company like Helios Corporation did not dare go any further than this. Their space laboratory was temporarily sealed, and the following record was left in the company's confidential files: It is still too early to touch the boundaries of \"laws\". Perhaps behind this curtain lies the realm of God.\
 After witnessing this, you will gain whole new insights into the form of \"light\".",
  ["3417"]="Continue collecting this special particle and obtain the chaotic/variant entity through collision tests. Even the powerful Cyril failed to achieve any advances in subsequent experiments. At a certain point, the relevant research suddenly could not be traced back. Only KSOIR 0 Directorate made a brief comment about this: The inability to observe is not accidental, but a microscopic manifestation of the law of cosmic selection. Cyril is not ready to pull back the veil.\
 After learning more about this, it is possible to generate new insights into the form of \"darkness\".",
  ["3418"]="Students of the Delphi Society usually carry notepads with them, which they use to record data, draw geometric shapes, and deduce formulas in an effort to retain an inspiration that wanders between numbers and lines - although most of the time, the functions of these formulas are not much different from that of draft paper.",
  ["3419"]="All secret alliances in different places have a tradition of selecting personnel through theoretical research. They will find those few manuscripts that stand out from the crowd among a sea of books - only those who possess a truly broad vision can combine several days and nights of deduction with that moment of inspiration to depict a world beyond numbers and lines.",
  ["342"]="Character XP materials",
  ["3420"]="Among the many manuscripts collected by the secret alliances, there is a very special category of manuscripts that come from the past. They are either hypotheses or arguments, and although their content is simple and clear, the conclusions themselves cannot be deduced or falsified, and they are every bit as unshakable as a final draft.\
 One manuscript even had a short note attached to it, in which its author said: \"I have thought about the process of proving this, but this paper is too small to write it all down.\"",
  ["3421"]="This stone tablet was created in an era before the emergence of the \"law\". At that time, people worked and rested according to the rising and setting of the sun, and looked up at the stars to know when to Develop and harvest. Engraved on this stone tablet is an agreement that these ancestors made with the sky and the earth.",
  ["3422"]="As time went by, people began giving rules to more and more things, and the marks on their stone tablets became deeper and clearer. The people of Cyril adhere to the iron law, which is what the people of Polestar call a contract, and what Qian recognizes as a tradition.",
  ["3423"]="A majestic stone tablet embedded with gilded engravings, radiating a powerful glow. Though countless epochs have passed, its inscriptions remain unchanged. Perhaps what this tablet records are not human laws but a cosmic order, etched at the dawn of the Milky Way.",
  ["3424"]="Qian has a long history, but if one wants to know the origin of this story, one must go all the way back to its starting point of the \"Xia\". Whether it is the mountain people living in the Mount Tianque mountain range or their ancestors living along the Grandeur River, they all had a concept of \"history\" right from the moment when the Qian Empire's first emperor confirmed the name of his empire. At that time, people had already begun to record the heavens, the earth, and the mountains and rivers, to offer sacrifices to the wise, and to think and record what they saw and thought in books, to be passed on to later generations.",
  ["3425"]="Many dynasties emerged after the Xia Dynasty, but as these dynasties changed, rose, and fell, they all eventually became what people call \"previous dynasties\". Even after much scorched earth and fighting, there were still people telling their stories, either for singing, mourning, formulating strategies, or coping with disasters - and the merits and demerits of all these dynasties will be left for future generations to judge.",
  ["3426"]="Qian had many legends. There was the first emperor who ruled the people, and there were strange beasts that could summon the wind and rain... But people die, summer ends, and no matter how powerful they once were, they no longer exist today. The only things that will not perish are the people who live on this land and the stories they tell. As long as they are still here, all these legends and stories will live on as well and will continue to grow with people's inheritance and become the driving force for them to move forward.",
  ["3427"]="It is difficult to tell whether people are simply describing the beauty of Bellefontaine, or whether it is Bellefontaine that is giving people the chance to describe beauty. Long before the Florentine family took over Bellefontaine, this city was already the promised land for countless artists. People from all over the world came to this garden city and left countless handwritten accounts.",
  ["3428"]="In Japh, Bellefontaine is practically a symbol of beauty, not only because of the beauty and richness of the city itself, but also because of the residents of the \"Flower City\". Bellefontaine's art is never just limited to palaces and exhibition halls. The flowers in front of the windows, the landscape on the streets, and the paintings on the walls are all examples of people's understanding and expression of art. That is why Bellefontaine's scenery always keeps changing over time, with its appearance in paintings always being different.",

  ["3432"]="One of Tasny's most shocking works, according to the design ideas in this book, is a new language that can eliminate all misunderstandings and ambiguities. All the words in this language have been precisely defined as comparable to mathematics, and can even be calculated like numbers. People who use this language will no longer have arguments when communicating, and who is right and who is wrong can easily be figured out by running some Arithmetics. The preface of this book is as follows: \"Mortals speaking different languages are constantly disturbing me every day. To save much trouble, I feel I must invent a language that can be used from now on and forever, a language whose meaning will not change with the passage of time. I want to use this language to express the following meaning to everyone: 'I am busy, don't bother me.'\" But right now only half of the book remains, the second half has been roughly torn off. There is also sloppy handwriting on the title page that states the following: It is ten times more troublesome for mortals to understand a complete language than it is for them to invent a complete language.",
  ["3433"]="One of Tasny's greatest creations, it is a typewriter that can automatically prove or falsify a proposition by simply inputting it, though its internal structure is unknown. When Tasny invented it, he named it \"Multi-key Self-adjusting Rhythmic Hypnotic Device,\" and the sound of it outputting the process of proving something cured Tasny's stubborn insomnia. But soon the members of Eme-an discovered that it was actually a Truth Verifier, and strongly demanded that Tasny hand it over for safekeeping. To get back at the librarians for taking away his beloved hypnotic device, Tasny input one final proposition into it: \"There is no proposition in the world that this machine cannot prove.\" This has caused it to continue operating ever since it first came into being, and because it is still continuously outputting the proof process for Tasny's final query, the librarians cannot use it for any other purposes at all.",
  ["3434"]="The original title of the book is \"Tasny's Private Recipe: Singularity Popcorn.\" The first half of the book spends a lot of space calculating the expansion and cooling model of the early universe after the singularity explosion, and combines this model with the material-thermodynamic equation of corn kernels expanding when heated in a microwave oven, the purpose being to calculate the space-time Harmonious at which the energy shock generated by the singularity explosion decays to just enough to make a bag of corn kernels into delicious popcorn. Next, the second half of the book conducts a detailed investigation of the mass distribution and evolution process in the universe today, and calculates the time when the next singularity explosion cycle will arrive. A librarian rescued this book from the pile of discarded manuscripts that Tasny had sent to the shredder, and changed it to its current title. Tasny's own handwriting can be seen on the back cover: The recipe failed, and the next singularity explosion will take too long to wait for.",
  ["3435"]="This is a strange book that begins with the statement \"This book lists only the books in this library that do not list their own titles\". According to this statement, if \"The Catalog of Paradoxes\" lists \"The Catalog of Paradoxes\", then there should not be \"The Catalog of Paradoxes\" in \"The Catalog of Paradoxes\". However, if \"The Catalog of Paradoxes\" does not list itself, \"The Catalog of Paradoxes\", then that means there should be \"The Catalog of Paradoxes\" in \"The Catalog of Paradoxes\". The pages of this book seem to be infinitely divisible, and any page can be rolled into two pages. Therefore, no one has yet been able to read the whole book in its entirety, and it is impossible to confirm whether \"The Catalog of Paradoxes\" itself is included in it or not.",
  ["3436"]="This is a page of notes with a brief proof of the \"Riemann hypothesis\" proposed by Michael Riemann, the Library of Babel's 365th Head Librarian. The entire page was later crossed out with a big black cross, and at the bottom it read \"All wrong. 366th Head Librarian, Bernhard Atalius.\"",
  ["3437"]="This is a special optical telescope created by Cassegrain Hubble, the Library's 362nd Head Librarian.\
 To minimize the impact of the atmosphere on the telescope, Cassegrain decided to make a telescope that can observe the starry sky in a thin atmosphere. He spent almost his entire life trying to overcome all the difficulties related to this, including but not limited to thumbnail drawings, replacements of materials, optical sensitivity, precision parts, medium transfers...\
 \
 \"Well, now there is only one question left to answer: How can we drain the atmosphere above the telescope?\"\
 - Epitaph of Cassegrain Hubble",
  ["3438"]="The throne of Phraataces, the fifth emperor of the Arsacid Empire who was also known as \"the Coward\", was exquisitely crafted and inlaid with large amounts of gold and gems. It is said that Darius, \"the King of all Kings\", ruled his empire from this throne, which was inherited from the ancient Obed Empire.\
 However, when Phraataces heard that Japh was about to send a large army to attack, he took the initiative to send an envoy, offering to give the throne to Japh as a peace offering.\
 The commander of the expeditionary army, Rubicon, rejected this request, as the tribute demanded by Emperor Thurinus was far more valuable than just that throne.",
  ["3439"]="Silver coins depicting a portrait of Emperor Thurinus once circulated in Japh and its neighboring countries.\
 They were heavy, finely crafted, and difficult to forge.\
 Thurinus himself generously gave many silver coins to countless merchants, asking them to spread them across foreign lands.\
 \"Go, let the world know of my wealth\", he said.\
 Even in a distant land like the Arsacid Empire, many people used coins minted by Javriel.\
 Many children from the Arsacid Empire also became familiar with the majestic face of the emperor on these silver coins even before they knew how to read the word \"Thurinus\".",
  ["344"]="Unlocks at Seer level 2",
  ["3440"]="This is a set of thick paper scrolls with wax seals of the ancient Eme-an.\
 Ever since ancient times, Eme-an has compiled an almanac every year and presented it to the emperor of Obed as a reward for his favor. The almanac includes noteworthy events that occurred each year, along with suggestions for the emperor to govern the empire.\
 In the era of the Arsacid Empire, Eme-an still adhered to this tradition, but all the almanacs it sent to the court of Phraataces were returned. Their intact wax seals and thick dust covering them proved that they had never been opened by this mediocre ruler.\
 The title of each volume of the almanac is written next to its wax seal, and the handwriting is still faintly visible as well. The title of the last volume is \"A Warning to Japh\".",
  ["3441"]="This is a collection of poems on parchment, written in the Japhetic language. The contents are said to be the experiences of seven ancient Japhetic poets after their travels to the East, telling of incredible things like the glorious empires of ancient emperors, towers that reach all the way up to the sky, and more.\
 Japhetic children all firmly believed that in the far East there was a great country with gold roofs and silver floor tiles.\
 When Emperor Thurinus finally issued a conscription order, many young people flocked to the barracks with fairy tales they had heard as children, ready to use them as clues to find gold and silver all over the East.\
 However, according to the research of members of Eme-an in later generations, this book was written when Emperor Thurinus was still young, and there are many traces of the handwriting of people who were court poets at the time.\
 The foresight of Emperor Thurinus may well be far beyond the imaginations of ordinary people.",
  ["3442"]="An ancient large clay jar stored in the Babel Tower, it contains the entire baking process from grinding wheat to baking bread in its upper half and an Eme-an inscription on its lower half:\
 Darius, the King of All Kings, obtained the recipe for making this extraordinary food from Memphis, and then he generously gave it to the wisest people in his land. \
 Darius, the King of All Kings, remembers all those who give to him, and he gives back a hundredfold in return.",

  ["3444"]="This is an ancient bronze box containing a set of metal instruments. The surface of the box is engraved with the ancient Obed imperial crest, indicating that it is imperial property.\
 Also inside the box is a roll of papyrus with several lines of scribbled notes written on it with a charcoal stick: \
 \"Mercury\" placed in the \"blood vessels\" cannot deliver immortality.\
 \"Brass\" placed in the \"bone marrow\" cannot deliver immortality.\
 \"Agate\" placed in the \"spine\" cannot deliver immortality.\
 And \"Pure silver\" placed in the \"stomach\" cannot deliver immortality, either.\
 The court's order in response? Continue trying.",
  ["3445"]="This ancient research notebook written on papyrus is divided into five volumes, each with the following side headings:\
 \"Measurement (completed)\",\
 \"Disassembly (failed)\", \
 \"Copying (failed)\", \
 \"Molding (completed)\",\
 \"Prayer (incomplete)\".\
 There is also a scribbled handwritten record at the end of the \"Prayer (incomplete)\" part:\
 In the past ten years, we have tried 370 languages, 74,890 words, and 156,789 short sentences.\
 Yet the ancient sun remains silent.\
 Why are the gods silent? We need more time.\
 But His Majesty has summoned me out of the tower.\
 I hope this research will not end up being interrupted, but if unfortunately it is, I must seal these records so that future generations may one day continue it.",

  ["3447"]="These manuals record the information of each of the Library's librarians, and are used to unlock the evolution of stories.\
 Whenever a member of Eme-an enters the library, the Eme-an secret alliance compiles relevant information about them into a book. This manual records every piece of information about a librarian in great detail, including but not limited to their social relationships, life experiences, hobbies, and personal interests...\
 Before embarking on a journey of no return, most people of Eme-an will take their own manuals with them as a final farewell to Eme-an.",
  ["3448"]="The relics of the Obed civilization are used to unlock the evolution of stories. \
 Once upon a time, the Obed people believed that the center of the world was the fertile crescent that lay beneath their feet. The philosophers along the Euphrates River spread the fires of wisdom, the craftsmen of the Elam Plains built magnificent palaces, and the sailors of the Philistine Sea sang distant poems... \
 But as time passed, everything was gradually forgotten on the edge of this world, and only the tall Babel Tower continued standing forever.",
  ["3449"]="A cube with infinite computing power, it is used to unlock the evolution of stories. \
 These cubes are mysterious storage devices that sometimes appear inexplicably in various places in the library, with interfaces that do not conform to any modern standards. The information in them is converted into electronic code, and only a chaotic signal like noise can be obtained. As time passes, this code gradually becomes more orderly. \
 Many scholars of Eme-an speculate that these cubes contain the \"futures\" that exist in the probability cloud. As history progresses, these vague probabilities collapse into established facts, and this information will allow humans to interpret these facts.",

  ["3807"]="Ninsar, we have another companion on our journey!",
  ["3808"]="That's quite rare, is this your new way of asking questions?",
  ["3809"]="Wow, I have an project that so happens to need this! Thanks so much!",
  ["381"]="1x",
  ["3810"]="Hey, you want to travel with me?",
  ["3811"]="If Ninsar is giving you a hard time, just let me know. I'll help you out!",
  ["3812"]="Just pick any one of my inventions. Consider it my gift to you.",
  ["3813"]="No matter when our paths cross again on our journeys, I will always welcome you to come hit the road with me again.",
  ["3814"]="This world doesn't have any secrets...everything in the universe might seem to be complicated, but in fact it's actually very simple.",
  ["3815"]="From gods to elements and bodily fluids to inorganic compounds, these were all people's understanding of water. I don't want to belittle all the efforts of our predecessors, but in my opinion, these definitions are far from reality.",
  ["3816"]="So you want to understand Me? Unfortunately, although it can understand language and move freely on its own, it is not a living creature...it's just a stone Golem that's able to think.",
  ["3817"]="The items Enki makes are either poorly designed or poorly made, making them very difficult to repair.",
  ["3818"]="Can you tell me what the world looks like through your eyes?",
  ["3819"]="It turns out that people who can see through everything are also sometimes lazy.",
  ["382"]="Fragment 4",
  ["3820"]="Every time you come here, your visit is always full of unexpected surprises.",
  ["3821"]="Enki prefers that way of greeting, you can go find him and try for yourself.",
  ["3822"]="What a strange creation...did you send it here because you want me to repair it?",
  ["3823"]="If there's anything you need restored, you can put in a request with Eme-an.",
  ["3824"]="What I do is neither maintenance and repair nor creation. I am simply making a poor imitation.",
  ["3825"]="Enki has run off to some strange place again, can you help me look for him? No need to worry about getting lost, I planted quite a few trackers on him.",
  ["3826"]="I'm willing to take any question you ask me, but I'm neither all-knowing nor all-powerful. All I know are some common truths about this world.",
  ["3827"]="I come here completely of my own free will, you don't have to feel like you're bearing a burden.",
  ["3828"]="As a child, I wanted to help my family with the farm work, but I was too weak to even lift a hoe. By the time I was strong enough to carry one, my hands had already been taken up by the sword. If I ever get the chance, I'd still like to try planting something, and if it blooms and bears fruit... that would be even better.",
  ["3829"]="Looking at the flowers in the spring, catching cicadas in the summer, harvesting fruit in the autumn, boiling snow in the winter...in the past, I never had the time to experience any of those elegant things that Master is talking about, but now that I'm by your side... No, it's nothing.",
  ["383"]="Story",
  ["3830"]="Watch out, the blades are without eyes.",
  ["3831"]="Are you asking what I used to do for my master? Don't you already know the answer? I eliminated everyone who got in his wayspecifically, you. Are you serious?",
  ["3832"]="My master always does things by following his heart, and in that respect you are kind of similar to him. I'm not praising you... nor am I scolding you, either. Just keep doing what you're doing.",
  ["3833"]="Please rest assured, I will keep watch over you in every direction.",
  ["3834"]="I hope you have been well.",
  ["3835"]="Please feel free to let me know if there's anything you want... nothing?",
  ["3836"]="Thank you, I will cherish this.",
  ["3837"]="At least I can still use the blade in my hand... Leave all the guardian work to me.",
  ["3838"]="It's customary to drink wine when meeting friends in Qian. I'm not very good at holding my liquor, so I prefer drinking tea to wine. You're not much of a drinker either? Then let's have some tea together.",
  ["3839"]="When you trust someone to watch your back, you have an understanding without having to say anything. And now that I have you behind me, there's no doubt about it.",
  ["384"]="Sweep",
  ["3840"]="I have nothing with which to express my feelings, but I do have a pair of swords that will follow your every move.",
  ["3841"]="Are you interested in the Tang Sect? Don't worry, it's not as mysterious as what people say online. Compared to other mysterious organizations, the Tang Sect is more like a class of family interests. They teach classes on weekdays, and only occasionally after class do they teach things like hidden weapons and juggling.",
  ["3842"]="Let's go watch a movie together. Oh, let me remind you in advance, don't be late. If you leave me alone in the cinema for more than five minutes, you might have to watch out for landmines on the way there. Ha, just kidding~",
  ["3843"]="You always see me in milk tea shops and hot pot restaurants? That's just me preparing materials for the restaurant exploration videos... Wait, you mean the ones wearing waiter uniforms? You..you must have seen that wrong!",
  ["3844"]="WeiShi definitely isn't bad. Although the name may be a bit tacky, what they do is actually pretty lit, detecting anomalies and investigating incidents. It also sounds like something that might be trending on the internet! It's just that they don't allow people to take photos or post updates, which is a bit much...",
  ["3845"]="Xin? Well, she sure is something when it comes to eating and fighting, but her ideas are too outdated. Not only does she not like my posts, but she also only ever sends voice messages. What era is she even living in?",
  ["3846"]="Help me get out my nail polish, I put it in my handbag. Don't worry, it's easy to find. It's in the second inner pouch to the right of the third outer pouch, just flip it over and you'll find... Wait, why are you taking a grenade out of there?!",
  ["3847"]="Why aren't you saying anything all of a sudden...Are you scrolling through your phone?",
  ["3848"]="Oh no, I'm not wearing any makeup right now...Wait for me! I just need five minutes!",
  ["3849"]="Don't touch a girl's hair without permission, you mess it up after a salon visit!",
  ["385"]="Settlement",
  ["3850"]="Is this for me? Then there's no rush to open it. Now help me get a tripod, I want to get a photo of this and post it online.",
  ["3851"]="You want to understand me a bit better? Then let's start with you treating me to hot pot! I want the super spicy kind!",
  ["3852"]="Tell me your social media accounts. From now on, we'll be friends.",
  ["3853"]="Let's go buy some clothes together~ If you always wear that gray coat, even the best-looking person would look plain.",
  ["3854"]="There have been a lot of lipsticks coming out lately, it's so hard to pick a color...come on over here, help me choose!",
  ["3855"]="The Tianli are warriors who have been sharpened by the mountains, wind, and frost. We don't need outsiders to tell us how to live our lives.",
  ["3856"]="Without the first ancestor of Tianli, there would never have been any first emperor's imperial power. The bronze throne was originally built with the bones and blood of the Tianli... Even if all the wars and battles are long since a thing of the past, the hatred from having one's country stolen away will never fade.",
  ["3857"]="I don't think the ancestral motto of \"never leaving QingYu City\" is a shackle that binds the Tianli clan. This is a responsibility of mine that I must fulfill, but as for the other clan members... they should indeed live more freely in this new world.",
  ["3858"]="This flute was given to me by a stranger when I was a child. Although I don't remember what that person looked like, I still miss him very much.",
  ["3859"]="You want to hear me sing a Tianli folk song? ...Are you dreaming or something? Don't you have any concept of occasion or etiquette? ...Come back here, and don't ever say anything like that to the other Tianli people.",
  ["386"]="Play",
  ["3860"]="Don't touch those swallowtail butterflies, they're poisonous... Hey, that goes for you guys too! Don't land on Seer's shoulder!",
  ["3861"]="Don't touch those swallowtail butterflies, they're poisonous... Hey, that goes for you guys too! Don't land on Seer's shoulder!",
  ["3862"]="How boring. Come on, let's fight.",
  ["3863"]="Hmph! So you finally decided to come back.",
  ["3864"]="Is this is a declaration of war against the Tianli?",
  ["3865"]="Could this be... Thank you. But next time, please give it to me privately. After all, I'm the clan head. Do you have any idea what a clan head's dignity means?!",
  ["3866"]="I hear that the Tianli clan members have been admiring you quite a lot recently...interesting.",
  ["3867"]="I will allow you to visit the Tianli ancestral home as a guest. If anyone tries to stop you, just mention my name.",
  ["3868"]="I've been practicing smithing lately. Is there any kind of ironware you like? I can make it for you.",
  ["3869"]="By an oath of blood at the river, and you will always be an ally of the Tianli clan.",
  ["387"]="Proceed",
  ["3870"]="Are you asking what I'm looking at? Of course, it's this world. Even though I've been looking at it for thousands of years, never once I ever get tired of it. In addition to Qian, I also take care of many of my friends' descendants, hometowns, and people.",
  ["3871"]="The so-called immortality and the so-called dragons are not a mere illusion. There is still much you don't know about the secrets hidden in this land of Qian. The WeiShi? I don't always play against them in chess, but occasionally I'll help make a few moves.",
  ["3872"]="Want to play a game of chess? Or a drinking game? Or a game of stones? We can play whichever one you'd like. After all, I invented most of the games in Qian many centuries ago.",
  ["3873"]="I always feel a bit sad whenever I make a new friend. The time I spend with them is just a short part of my life's journey, but they will spend their entire lives with me. But you, it seems, are able to break out of this cycle.",
  ["3874"]="I can promise one thing for you. Well, maybe you should think of it as being like me granting you a wish. It's a bit embarrassing to say this, but as long as you don't ask for some miracle like turning black hair white, growing horns on horses, raising the dead, or making bones bleed, I can probably make it happen.",
  ["3875"]="Similarly, I'd like you to promise me one thing as well... I hope you can live a long, stable, and healthy life.",
  ["3876"]="Ha...There's plenty of time, what's the rush?",
  ["3877"]="We meet again. How many times would you say we have met?",
  ["3878"]="Come on, don't be nervous. I'm not about to just suddenly disappear.",
  ["3879"]="Wow, this is quite nice. I'll accept it and give you something in return in the future.",
  ["388"]="Chapter 2",
  ["3880"]="Well done. If you ever want to change your career, I can help you arrange that whenever. I must have something in this pile of identities of mine that I can use to write a letter of recommendation. But I probably wouldn't want Nemesis to do that.",
  ["3881"]="Are you hungry? Are you cold? Why don't you eat some more? You can't wear so little clothing.",
  ["3882"]="Days like this are quite tiring, aren't they? I feel the same way. Next time you might as well travel with me and relax. We can go wherever we want and look at whatever we want, and I can be your guide.",
  ["3883"]="I'm giving you this jade seal. You can play with it or use it as a footrest if you wish. It's fulfilled its purpose. Whenever you see it in the long life you have ahead of you, if it makes you think of me then that is enough.",
  ["3884"]="If you ever need encouragement, just come to me. But remember, just like pulling delicate strings requires balance, don't push yourself too hard.",
  ["3885"]="Please, give me your hand. I'll help you tie the puppet string. See? With just a simple move, the puppet follows along.",
  ["3886"]="Did your clothes get damaged in the fight again? Don't worry, I'll patch them up with my special thread. What design would you prefer for the patchesan animal or a small flower?",
  ["3887"]="You may have noticed that I treat puppets no differently than people. Does that strike you as odd? I don't think it shouldafter all, friendship isn't bound by species. No matter what form you are, I'll always treat you the same.",
  ["3888"]="Can my memories be recovered? I'm not sure... But somehow, I feel like it might actually be better not to remember them. The past isn't always something worth holding on to.",
  ["3889"]="I made a little puppet who I can talk to in my spare time. If you don't mind, you can take her with you. But if you do, please don't abandon her, not even in the end. You might not realize it, but puppets have feelings too.",
  ["389"]="Hard",
  ["3890"]="Feeling bored? Let me perform a puppet show for you.",
  ["3891"]="I can feel the strings humming from afar. Ah, it's really you who's come back, just like I expected.",
  ["3892"]="The puppet strings are thin but incredibly strong. Be careful not to cut yourself while using them.",
  ["3893"]="Are you complimenting me for how well I've been doing lately? I'll keep up the good work.",
  ["3894"]="Which do you prefer, the Qian-style puppet or the Japhethian puppet?",
  ["3895"]="When you're feeling down, just tug on the thread, and I'll be right by your side.",
  ["3896"]="If I ever forget all this again, please do remind me of you, alright?",
  ["3897"]="I hope it's not too forward of me to ask, but would you mind if I created a puppet modeled after you?",
  ["3898"]="No one is wealthier than Florence, so I would never betray her.",
  ["3899"]="The maids at the Florentine household have plenty to do, including dusting the vases, and sweeping up shards from broken ones.",
  ["39"]="Reward",
  ["390"]="Preview",
  ["3900"]="I don't quite understand what troubles the Duchess every day... though I can see why the Steward worriesthose \"mishaps\" that happen while I'm cleaning.",
  ["3901"]="The tasks are simple, the pay is generous, there's an endless supply of afternoon tea, and the uniforms are stylish, custom-made, and combat-ready. I wholeheartedly invite you to join the Florentine household as a maid.",
  ["3902"]="If one day we find ourselves on the battlefield together, I'm sure we'll be fighting on the same side... Actually, never mind, you'd be better off standing behind me.",
  ["3903"]="I once had a souped-up motorcycle. It was beautiful, sleek, and powerful. The roar of its engine was deep and commanding. If I ever get the chance to own it again, I'll ride it and take you on a thrilling joyride.",
  ["3904"]="Does this picture frame... need cleaning? ...Uh, never mind.",
  ["3905"]="Welcome. Tea and snacks? I didn't receive any request to prepare those for you.",
  ["3906"]="The Duchess hasn't forbidden me from laying a hand on you.",
  ["3907"]="How did you learn about my preferences? ...Such impressive intelligence-gathering skills.",
  ["3908"]="If you need me to handle routine cleaning, you can submit a request to the Duchess. After all, this job is provided by the Florentine household.",
  ["3909"]="Or maybe we could grab a drink to celebrate... You don't drink? Ugh.",
  ["391"]="July 15th 18:45",
  ["3910"]="I don't need to say anything more to prove my trust in you.",
  ["3911"]="My past? Any related records should have been erased long ago. Stop dwelling on those unrealistic things. The heavy snow in Cyril is something you can't handle. Focus on what's right in front of you.",
  ["3912"]="Your library is vast beyond measure, and you are the only first-class star in this universe... How impressive.",
  ["3913"]="Don't worry. I know I shouldn't sit at someone else's desk, and I understand that paper and pens aren't for eating... But that little birdcan I play with it? It won't get hurt, right?",
  ["3914"]="The ones in the sky follow their orbits, while we on the ground move along our \"agreements\".",
  ["3915"]="Celestial bodies have no emotions, yet people give them unique names. The \"companion stars\" that stay close, the \"wandering planet\" that drifts uncertain in its orbit, the \"lonely satellite\" that watches from afar... Hmm, I really like these names.",
  ["3916"]="Ah, watch your step. These are my records. That one contains the folk songs from Qian, that one is a newly released album from a metal band, and the golden one is... Oh, the library doesn't allow music to be played out loud? Alright then...",
  ["3917"]="Stars never stop moving; all we can do is alter their course... At the zenith of your celestial sphere, there will always be a guiding star that never changes its position.",
  ["3918"]="\"And outside, the endless stillness feels like a god deep in slumber...\"",
  ["3919"]="I know. I know your path will lead you back here.",
  ["392"]="Story Log",
  ["3920"]="Hmm? What does this mean? What are you trying to say?",
  ["3921"]="Is this a gift? I know what gifts are. A gift is something people give to others to express their feelings. \"Give\" means the gift belongs to me now, and \"feelings\" means... What does it mean again?",
  ["3922"]="Could you pass me that book? Hmm... an orange, I'll share it with you.",
  ["3923"]="The universe is an empty and eerily silent place, so every intersection of orbits is something truly worth cherishing.",
  ["3924"]="Make a wish, and I'll try to fulfill it for you.",
  ["3925"]="You are destined to embark on a journey surrounded by the stars... Who will be the brightest among them?",
  ["3926"]="Indeed, I despise fools. But low intelligence alone doesn't make one a fooltrue foolishness is a moral failing.",
  ["3927"]="The moment you sense I'm slipping into sleep, wake meby any means necessary. I won't hold it against you afterward. Just don't let me sink into slumber.",
  ["3928"]="Thinking is like walking through a deep, intricate maze. Once you realize that thinking itself is the essence of existence, you'll have found the thread that leads you out of the maze.",
  ["3929"]="If you happen to meet that child, sing her a lullaby. Sometimes she forgets she's in a dream... You ask who she is? Hmm? Haven't you met her yet?",
  ["393"]="Basic attack",
  ["3930"]="One day, we shall meet again on the edge of dreams, my dear Seer. And when we awaken together, we will understand our true worth.",
  ["3931"]="I truly hope you linger in the dream a while longerfor once, that child and I are in rare agreement.",
  ["3932"]="Terribly sleepy... How much sleep did I get last time? ... Three hours, was it? I can hold on a little longer...",
  ["3933"]="Welcome, esteemed Head Librarian of Eme-an. It seems that neither of us has lost our way today. A cause for celebration indeed.",
  ["3934"]="Now's not the time to play with thread.",
  ["3935"]="I am well aware of both the value of this gift and the thought behind it. Thank you. When the time comes, I will repay you in kind.",
  ["3936"]="As fellow leaders of the Secret Alliance, let's collaborate with each other.",
  ["3937"]="Call me Ariadne. There's no need to refer to me as the Grand Oracle anymore.",

 \"The walking stick is a friend of travelers. It can support a tired body, test a fragile floor, drive away dangerous beasts, and open up a dull mind.\" Elish said.\
 In the long years that followed, many such walking sticks were brought to various parts of the library by their owners and scattered throughout an endless number of rooms.",

 \"Huh? A name? That's too troublesome... Just call it 'Don't mess with me'!\"\
 \"...Forget it, here you go.\"\

 Grandfather Cosmos rarely took action, but throughout his long life, no Anomaly had ever been able to hurt him.\
 Young Ere swung the sickle under Nanna's guidance without any hesitation.\
 - Enheduanna, I must become an outstanding person of Eme-an who is not inferior to my grandfather!",
  ["5289"]="When did things go off track?\
 When did my grandfather stop paying attention to me?\
 When I came to my senses, the sickle was in Ereshan's hand and the scarred blade was like a road to destruction in front of her.",
  ["529"]="ATK",
  ["5290"]="The traditional sword of the Japhetic army.\
 The specifications of this sword were fixed as early as the reign of Emperor Thurinus. Perhaps the casting materials or smelting technology have been updated since then, but the standard has remained unchanged to this day.",
  ["5291"]="The stained glass windows of churches are the eyes of God through which the Supreme Will looks down lovingly upon the world.\
 Craftsmen firmly believe that when one blinks one's eyes, one can see the beautiful blossoms of another world here in this world.\
 The fragments of stained glass windows on the body of this sword do indeed reflect this scenery of the world on other side.\
 This is why pairs of pious hands embedded these sacred broken windows into pure metal to form stained glass windows.\
 - Japhetic Ethics, may the person who wields this sword be forever favored and loved.",
  ["5292"]="When folded, it can be used as a deadly weapon, and when opened, it is the perfect complement to elegant clothing.\
 The sun can only fall on the umbrella, and the shadows remain under it.\
 Even back when Asti was still an apprentice housekeeper, she had it specially customized. It is a tool, a weapon, and a symbol, and naturally the symbol of the Florentine family is branded on it, as is its owner.",
  ["5293"]="Asti was given this umbrella as a gift after becoming the head steward for the Florentine family.\
 In the eyes of outsiders, it seems that the design of this umbrella is particularly gorgeous, which is so it matches the holder's identity as the newly promoted head steward for the Florentine family.\
 Of course, for someone like that, it is only natural to use this gorgeous existence to dress up the newly promoted Duke of Florentine.\
 The sharpness of the ribs of the umbrella is perfectly hidden under its luxurious appearance, right until the steward points the sharp tip of the umbrella towards uninvited guests who try to harm Florentine.",
  ["5294"]="This is said to have been an antique that was passed down from Ming's great-great-great-great-grandfather.\
 Ming's first reaction after receiving it was to hand it over to a museum, but her grandfather stopped her.\
 After that, Ming reluctantly accepted the lamp stick, and also accepted the responsibility that had been passed down from her great-great-great-great-grandfather - or someone even older - to the present day.",
  ["5295"]="\"Mist and fog seal the mountain path, heavy clouds hide the waning moon, the sight of a lamp's shadow in the dim reveals the guide's arrival.\"\
A poem that does not follow the rules of level and oblique tones is engraved on the staff. According to records, this was left by the person who saved the first owner of the staff. With its indigo-colored long-handled lantern, the material of the staff head is unknown, but it seems to be related in some way to QingYu City. The blue flame of the wick is strange but also soft. Even on a dark night shrouded by fog, this light can still illuminate the way forward.\
Although it is not exactly a fully qualified poem, anyone who sees it will understand the responsibility that one should shoulder when holding this staff.",
  ["5296"]="\"The Rogue Saber is a long sword held by infantry, and is also an ancient horse-breaking sword.\"\
 The long-handled sword was forged according to the standards recorded in ancient books. The design of the blade and handle reminds people of the light and shadow left behind by a dragon or a phoenix flying across the sky. When Qing swung the sword, the traces it left in the air almost made people think they were witnessing an imagined scene with their own eyes.",
  ["5297"]="In the beginning, the universe was like an egg.\
 According to legend, a knife was first made which then divided the chaos and judged the universe.\
 After that the heaven and earth opened up, and the clouds and water separated.",
  ["5298"]="The giant hammer forged by Hephae is a practice piece. \
 While it may seem unremarkable among her countless works, it is worlds apart from the mass-produced iron tools available on the market. Many have spent a fortune hoping to acquire a product born from such dedicated practice. \
 Most importantly, despite its intimidating weight, it feels much like wielding a baseball bat, perfectly suited to Hephae's strength.",
  ["5299"]="Hephae's masterpiece embodies the principles of simplicity and ease of use, combining both striking and explosive capabilities. It is currently her most satisfying work to date. \
 \"If tools cannot be used easily by people, then research is meaningless.\"\
 To simplify tools to the utmost, Hephae sought testers ranging from centenarians to three-year-olds. It turns out that any primate with hands can grasp its usage within an aveRage of 30 seconds. \
 However, the craftsman's satisfaction is always fleeting; after developing this giant hammer, Hephae turned her attention to even simpler and more perfect designs. \
 Perhaps one day, she will introduce even more masterpieces...",
  ["53"]="Start Analysis",
  ["530"]="Armor penetration",
  ["5300"]="The weapon designed by Logos herself and commissioned to Hephae to make is a rapier that combines a sword and a harp.\
 Hephae could understand most of the mathematical expressions and material names on the design blueprint when they were read separately, but she could not understand them at all when they were all put together on a single piece of paper.\
 After many repeated inquiries, Logos bluntly stated that the design concept of the weapon was to enable people to take into account the mathematical expressions and deeper logical deductions when swinging it.\
 Hephae was completely confused by this, but in the end she did miraculously manage to complete the production of the weapon.",
  ["5301"]="This heavy stone tablet showing the wear and tear of time has many ancient laws engraved on it.\
 According to legend, it comes from a distant era. At that time, ancestors had established a magnificent empire called Obed between two rivers. However, even though everyone was all citizens of the empire, people from different regions who spoke different languages and had different identities still continued to attack each other for a hundred years. \
 Therefore, the king ordered his craftsmen to erect a solid stone in his palace, after which he also ordered his wise men to engrave a hundred inscriptions on the stone tablet saying how he would rule his subjects.\
 - Those who are in Obed should follow the words of the inscriptions, and must not do evil deeds or bully the weak.",
  ["5302"]="The origin of this huge stone tablet is unknown, though the sun has left a deep mark on it.\
 If his words and deeds are all laws, then the inscriptions on the tablet should change with the direction of the light.\
 This stone tablet has been restored several times, but it has also been shattered a few times as well.\
 Both it and Shamash remain silent regarding everything about it.\
 The golden words carved on it are all laws, except for one eternal law:\
 \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.\"",
  ["5303"]="This is the viola case that Viola received after joining Eme-an.\
 On the first day she arrived at the Library of Babel, she specially requested that a long note with obscure content be wrapped around the viola case as a \"seal\", which would ideally prevent the instrument from making any sounds.\
 However, it seemed that this seal was really just preventing the violist from opening the viola case more than it was sealing the instrument inside...",
  ["5304"]="This is the viola case that Viola has used the longest. \
 Every time Viola plays, she expresses the existence she feels through the melody. But if that existence really resides in the melody... then even while the player feels it through the sound of the viola, at the same time is it also feeling the player's world through the sound of the viola?\
 As a result, the viola case, which was supposed to protect the viola, gradually turned into something more like a \"shell\" of some kind of existence - many people who listened to Viola's performances mentioned the cracks on her viola case and the gaze that looked back at them.\
 But whenever asked about this, Viola always said she had no idea about any of that.",
  ["5305"]="Its shape is like a crescent moon, like a double blade forged from quicksand.\
 When she is quiet and calm, the moonlight is gentle, and when she turns, it reminds people that there are also shadows on the back of the moon that cannot be seen.\
 Except for Nanna, no one knows who made this weapon because it has been such a long time.",
  ["5306"]="With its twin blades made of mysterious materials, the color reminds people of the two great rivers flowing through the land of roaring lions.\
 The river water reflects the moonlight, and it bore witness to the era when the throne rotated under the Babel Tower.\
 As she looked up at the moon, she had also witnessed the changes that Eme-an had experienced under the rushing torrent of time.",
  ["5307"]="Each huge scroll has intricate patterns on the back, and inside them are scattered vague words or half-finished deductions.\
 Enki has made many preparations for the purpose of exploring the library, and this is one of his most convenient tools.\
 It can be used for writing or calculations, or even as a pillow or a stool. It is a must-have both when at home and while traveling.\
 Since it's already essentially a weapon, now we must find a way to add blasting and defense functions to it.",
  ["5308"]="This is a magnificent scroll made by Enki himself. Its main part is assembled from many delicate smaller parts. Although the handwriting on it is obscure and difficult to understand, it does succinctly reproduce the various structures of the Library of Babel and explains the problems that have troubled Eme-an for centuries. If you decide to explore the library, this scroll would undoubtedly be the best guide.\
 - Excerpted from \"The Treasures of Eme-an\"\
 \
 \"Enki! What did you do to my towel? How did it become like this?\"",
  ["5309"]="Ninsar had found and repaired a classic suitcase from a pile of antiques.\
 The space inside was much larger than what it looked like from the outside.\
 She once thought about restoring and modifying it to a size that could fit Enki, but later gave up.\
 After restoring it she then put it aside, not even knowing whether she would want to use it one day. With a little fear and a little anticipation, she waited for the long journey that would eventually come, though when it did she didn't know when or whether it would end.",
  ["531"]="DEF",
  ["5310"]="The suitcase was sealed with bandages, clocks, and codes. No one could open it without Ninsar's permission.\
 There were many kinds of things in the suitcase related to Enki, the library, or their parents - if it was anything related to the Path of No Return, Ninsar would just put it in the suitcase without any discussion.\
 \"Just confiscate all the tools and block all the roads. That way, even Enki will gradually give up on the idea.\"\
 At that time, she did not know that tools and roads have always been just ways. What really guided Eme-an to the Path of No Return was... the anticipation of the unknown.",
  ["5311"]="This is a simple dagger that is just the right size to fit in the palm of one's hand or hide in one's sleeve, making it perfect for assassins.\
 It was chosen by Wushi's master for self-defense when Wushi was young.\
 There isn't anything special about it, it's just a good, cheap item bought from the market, and after buying it the master boasted about his ability to identify and bargain.\
 It has been used frequently for many years, but it never became dull or got damaged, proving that the master's judgment was quite good after all.",
  ["5312"]="The dagger that this \"Master\" personally made for Wushi was modeled after the famous sword that had killed an ancient emperor.\
 When Wushi asked his master how he knew the details of the shape, Master simply replied \"I've seen it\".\
 Master often made surprising statements, and with Wushi's experience he had no way of knowing whether such statements were true or false.\
 Wushi firmly believed that he had not made any mistake in following his master.\
 However, a joke that his master made when he handed him the dagger was one that he could not forget for a long time.\
 \"What will you do when I'm gone?\"",
  ["5313"]="Among the four arts of the Tang Sect, there is one called \"mechanical skills\". Sect members who study this art often make a box of mechanical skills and make sure that all mechanical tools are prepared for emergencies.\
 Azi, who has been learning these four arts ever since she was young, naturally has a box of her own. However, her understanding of what constitutes an \"emergency\" is a little different from that of ordinary people.\
 \"In addition to being able to fire cannons, it must also be able to defend. It would be best to install a few inner boxes in here to store my lipstick... No, no! If that's the case, I'll also have to add a shock-absorbing design.\"",
  ["5314"]="This portable piece of artillery is based on the \"Thousand Receivers\" recorded in the ancient books of the Tang Sect, and is manufactured using modern technology.\
 The receivers use an advanced modular design. Although they look like suitcases, they can hold a variety of weapons. Based on the main weapon system, the receivers are also equipped with multiple artillery modules and vehicle modules that can launch drones, making them worthy of the name \"Thousand Machines\".\
 In her spare time, Azi often disassembles and reassembles receivers to add functions to them. Today, these receivers are compatible with dozens of additional uses such as lighting, hair dryers, and cosmetics cases.\
 \"Huh? Why are there so many extra screws?\"",
  ["5315"]="This sword was forged using the ancient method of the tough Tianli clan, who used it as a gift for children.\
 It is simple, reliable, sharp and durable. It is said that Li Jun once used such a sword to cut off his own reflection in the water, which is how it got its name \"Indigo Shadow\".",
  ["5316"]="It is said that this sword was inherited from Li Jun, the first ancestor of the Tianli clan, and it was one of the most proud works of this Lord of Weaponry.\
 After Ji Xia went out to travel, Li Jun, who was in charge as regent, had a headache while attending a memorial. At the time, memorials were all in the form of bamboo slips, so Li Jun forged a sword.\
 On the day the sword was completed, he cut a thousand bamboo slips in front of all the ministers and ordered that empty words and empty talk should be avoided, and that in the future memorials should not be longer than one foot.\
 This sword was used by the first emperor to write red comments, and so it was named \"Zhupi,\" or \"red monarch.\"",
  ["5317"]="Custom-made by WeiShi and personally gifted to Yuli by Yuanquan, it is the first weapon she remembers. Though it lacks the grandeur of a sword's tip or the deadly sharpness of a bloodthirsty blade, it serves as both a defensive and offensive tool, even stitching wounds during retreats.\
Its true purpose lies in protection rather than combat, always ensuring that unnecessary bloodshed is avoided.",
  ["5318"]="\"Fine clouds weave patterns, shooting stars carry sorrow, and the Milky Way spans silently.\"\
 When Yuli matured into a fully capable puppeteer, Sue gifted her these three treasured long needles, said to be relics from her ancestora puppeteer from centuries ago.\
 Over the long years, the needles have lost their initial luster, yet the ancient patterns etched upon them continue to tell tales of a forgotten past.\
 Memories are like an intricate web, one that anyone can weave.",

  ["6594"]="Welcome to the backside of the world.",
  ["6595"]="The purpose of information lies in its retrieval, not its creation. Simply compiling everything is the same as having nothing if this information cannot be accessed. It is as good as nothing.",
  ["6596"]="Looks like someone tried to send us a message through these bookshelves.",
  ["6597"]="So, if we want to see him still around, we have to go back eighty years.",
  ["6598"]="Once the unknown is revealed, there is no turning back to ignorance.",
  ["6599"]="Tasny served as director for only one year, making him the director with the shortest tenure. He didn't leave much information about himself.",
  ["66"]="Stage Points:",
  ["660"]="Take on Mission",
  ["6600"]="So, visitors from another sector... What is it that you seek?",
  ["6601"]="My name is Ninsar.",
  ["6602"]="Yeah, that's the coded gate that my stupid brother set up. It'll only open when all its questions are answered.",
  ["6603"]="I've seen your determination to explore the Library. Now, all I can give you is my blessing for the adventure that lies ahead.",
  ["6604"]="They could have commanded the sun to rise, yet they knelt to pray to it. Is there anything more stupid than that?",
  ["6605"]="Hey, fools! If you are actually reading this note, congrats! You've made it to the world three years later.",
  ["6606"]="We made it to the Hall of Keys. This should be where the permission that Master Enki left us is located.",
  ["6607"]="Hey, there! Fools from three years ago!",
  ["6608"]="As the unknown became known, the humanity retains only one way to explain the universe, and the rest will become legends.",
  ["6609"]="Goodbye, my unexpected friends...I hope we'll meet again in our future journey.",
  ["661"]="Claim Reward",
  ["6610"]="Her journey ahead is already brimming with endless surprises and magnificence.",
  ["6611"]="I desire the sun only. If they decline my request, destroy them all, and if they are willing to relinquish it, you shall decide their fate.",
  ["6612"]="Throughout its long history, Obed was sometimes the center of a powerful empire, while at other times it became the vassal of an even more powerful empire, the fifth emperor of the Arsacid Empire, was an instance of the latter.",
  ["6613"]="According to the history records, a solitary star of unparalleled splendor emerged in the night sky above Ephrathah. Unlike other stars, it remained fixed over Ephrathah.",
  ["6614"]="Our general is looking for you...",
  ["6615"]="I am Sarvis, a senator of Japheth and a general serving His Highness Rubicon.",
  ["6616"]="All the clues we've gathered so far are like scattered leaves from the same tree, and behind each leaf, we catch a glimpse of the blurry figure of Darius.",
  ["6617"]="Get up, I will share glory and dreams with all you... and there will eventually come a day when we fill the entire sky with our footprints!",
  ["6618"]="The Immortal Army shall never fail His Majesty...",
  ["6619"]="Did I still rule over my vast empire?",
  ["662"]="Pause",
  ["6620"]="He will inevitably survive, just as he had survived every war up to now. And he will inevitably survive until the world's end.",
  ["6621"]="Cause and effect become one in the Library of Babel.",
  ["6622"]="Since time is of the essence, let me get straight to the point. Do you know how to shut down the Sun God of Memphis?",
  ["6623"]="How extraordinary it is to craft a star?",
  ["6624"]="Me, my family, and my descendants...will forever remember this vow, from now until eternity.",
  ["6625"]="That night, he stood beside the tiny fire counting the flickers of flame and recalling the adventures he had had on his way back from the expedition. And then he saw the starry night sky reflected in the stream beside him.",
  ["6626"]="Light determines the optimal path even before embarking on its journey, as it is aware of its ultimate destination.",
  ["6627"]="Because we knew that Aten was about to explode, we set out on this journey to find the words of God in order to prevent this explosion. However, it is precisely because we have found the words of God that Aten is about to explode in the first place.",
  ["6628"]="Ereshan has betrayed us. She's the one who activated Aten.",
  ["6629"]="Shamash will take this intelligence to Nanna, and we will... go find Ereshan.",
  ["663"]="Rest",
  ["6630"]="And then, everything is annihilated by the white radiance.",
  ["6631"]="All deeds have consequences. All debts must be paid.",
  ["6632"]="So, we'll combat infinity with infinity. We'll use the Library to achieve trillions of possibilities.",
  ["6633"]="Let's continue connecting the computing power modules in parallel.",
  ["6634"]="Now we're just missing the final module.",
  ["6635"]="A deluge of possibilities courses through its efficient processing core, much like the ancient people of Memphis chanted in a language they did not comprehend.",
  ["6636"]="The sanguine pond spreading from beneath the girl resembles a crimson flower, blooming with her as the center.",
  ["6637"]="This isn't over yet. Aten hasn't detonated itself...",
  ["6638"]="Within the cone of light is fate. Even if we could change the past, I'm afraid it would still be fate.",
  ["6639"]="Deep within the ruins, a mutilated yet massive statue slowly rises up.",
  ["664"]="Lost Value -5",
  ["6640"]="Overhead, without any fuss, the stars are going out.",
  ["6641"]="The lines crumble, and the light dissipates.",
  ["6642"]="From now on, there will be no God in the universe, no Just Verdict, and therefore no punishment from heaven.",
  ["6643"]="The time has come to fulfill the \"vow\".",
  ["6644"]="May this vast land...be lush and green forever.",
  ["6645"]="I don't believe there is such a thing is this world as mysterious disasters that occur for no reason. I ask all departments to assist me in investigating all objective conditions that might lead to crops failing.",
  ["6646"]="They seem to be more interested in the water being sprayed by these sprinkler systems.",
  ["6647"]="This is something that is within the abilities of the CangLin municipal government. We should not encourage laziness, nor should we let WeiShi interfere too much in the modern society.",
  ["6648"]="These thousands of miles of fertile fields irrigated by the Grandeur River have been prosperous since ancient times. It is a land of fish and rice, a place of \"when its crops are matured, the entire world is well-fed.\"",
  ["6649"]="A true gentleman is someone who observes a game of chess in silence. If anyone wants to interfere with this game, let them be silent forever.",
  ["665"]="Fully Equipped",
  ["6650"]="Welcome to Qian.",
  ["6651"]="This fog was quite likely some Anomaly, or at least its indirect effect, and we had sailed right into it.",
  ["6652"]="Seer, where are you...",
  ["6653"]="After all, farming season waits for no one. Sunlight and rain come according to the seasons, so if you miss the right time, you will end up with nothing.",
  ["6654"]="Ha! I finally caught you, you intruder! What are you doing sneaking around here?!",
  ["6655"]="Canglin City is currently in a Level 1 state of emergency. Please comply with the emergency management regulations issued by the CangLin municipal government.",
  ["6656"]="What exactly do the secret alliances of Qian, which have been passed down for thousands of years, look like?",
  ["6657"]="My name is Qing. I am a member of WeiShi and also Zhi Jing of the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity of the CangLin municipal government of CangLin City.",
  ["6658"]="However, ever since the emergence of the Cerulean Blight, CangLin City's funeral homes have stopped accepting the bodies of the dead...",
  ["6659"]="Wushi stood up, all the confusion in his eyes gone.",
  ["666"]="Leave",
  ["6660"]="Nongsang Pavilion is actually the office building of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture. When the city was constructed, all the urban areas were centered around the Pavilion, and the square is part of the office complex.",
  ["6661"]="It's just that this drought has gone on for so long now. Will there ever be a day when the rains come again?",
  ["6662"]="Come on, let the fight between hunters begin!",
  ["6663"]="Without death, there is no life.",
  ["6664"]="Time goes by. Let me offer you a glass of wine.",
  ["6665"]="And I also always believe that this land will always be willing to open its arms to you.",
  ["6666"]="Therefore, a handful of rice will turn into a handful of gold after it has passed through the road to the far west.",
  ["6667"]="I've traveled over eight million kilometers in my life, so driving a few thousand kilometers at the last minute is no big deal.",
  ["6668"]="But a few days ago, the Wellbeing Office ordered a reversal of the water transfer. They wanted to raise the water level in the northern reservoir to address the water shortage in CangLin City.",
  ["6669"]="Bodhisattva, Bodhisattva...when will you finally bring your salvation?",
  ["667"]="Law Fragment",
  ["6670"]="The flowers of Tiao are bluish green, and so are its leaves. If I had known my life would be like this, I wouldn't have chosen to come into this world.",
  ["6671"]="Of course, the world therefore also calls him by another title - The Sower.",
  ["6672"]="Here it is... Wushi was born in the far western regions. He lost his parents at a young age and was adopted. He then moved around until he finally came to CangLin City to work and settle down.",
  ["6673"]="After all, on this day everyone realized that the people themselves are the Bodhisattvas.",
  ["6674"]="Nongsang Pavilion? The square in front of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture? What are you planning to do there?",
  ["6675"]="Did he personally destroy CangLin City's agricultural production and want to infect all its citizens with Cerulean Blight?",
  ["6676"]="If nothing unexpected happens, she is fighting a tough battle... Please make sure you stop Wushi and that you prevent Feng Lin's insane plan from coming to fruition!",
  ["6677"]="Please stop it from causing any more damage in the city.",
  ["6678"]="Don't forget the name \"WeiShi\", we only ever proceed from a practical perspective. If there's no better way, then we'll have to do it this way.",
  ["6679"]="If this rain had fallen during that spring ten years ago...",
  ["668"]="Enemies time freeze: Duration extended",
  ["6680"]="Old friends no longer stay, water is easily lost, and fine wine is rare. These are the three biggest regrets in life.",
  ["6681"]="Heavy rain comes easily in late autumn. Only nature treats all life between heaven and earth so equally and with such compassion.",
  ["6682"]="Cangluo, ever since you created \"writing\", you have named many things. So why not give this great river a name too?",
  ["6683"]="The headline could be something like, \"A Shocking Sight: Unveiling an Empty QingYu City!\"",
  ["6684"]="The ancient architecture, with its substantial eaves and tiles reminiscent of pages in a millennium-old book, unveils the extensive history.",
  ["6685"]="Lord of Weaponry, huh? Great... I'm looking forward to our next encounter.",
  ["6686"]="Visitors from afar ~ The collision of styles between Qian and Obed! #QingYu City #HanzeRegion #DailyLife #GirlyVibes",
  ["6687"]="I thank you for saving my people, outsiders.",
  ["6688"]="Gathering the ferns, gathering the ferns, the ferns have grown tall. Saying \"let's go home\" and \"let's go home,\" yet the year doesn't seem to end.",
  ["6689"]="I understand that he is revered as the progenitor of human culture, but he can be the progenitor of any land or ethnicityjust not the Tianli people. We have our own ancestor, Li Jun.",
  ["669"]="Confused",
  ["6690"]="Under the watchful gaze of the Big Dipper, sealed in blood, the Tianli clan and the Ji clan hereby forge an unbreakable alliance. This vow shall stand eternal, and any who dare to break it will be forsaken by both heaven and earth!",
  ["6691"]="I'm awaiting you at the heart of the royal palace. Please escort our esteemed Head Librarian there.",
  ["6692"]="A majestic city gate stands imposingly before us, its green glazed tiles shimmering under the clear sky like freshly forged dragon scales.",
  ["6693"]="Henceforth, the annals of history were tinged with a distinct cerulean tint.",
  ["6694"]="Well, there's much you're unaware of, Ming. In fact, the Head Librarian isn't exactly an \"outsider.\"",
  ["6695"]="All monarchs bowed, kingdom melded as one. Atop Mount Tianque gleams QingYu, the sun.",
  ["6696"]="If the plan was to build a dam from the start, why would anyone go through the effort of constructing a bridge instead?",
  ["6697"]="By the honor of the Lord of Weaponry, I will honor the Emperor's trust.",
  ["6698"]="An old friend's help can only go so far. Stay safe, Li Chi.",
  ["6699"]="A giant bird covered in metallic feathers slowly descends toward the center of the Tianchi Lake, its wings flapping and creating a powerful gust of wind.",

 I can grant you one wish:",
  ["7579"]="Stepping through the overgrown flowers and tangled vines, you enter the ancient Obed gardens. Unnamed flowers bloom freely, and statues covered in moss obscure their features. The entire garden lies quietly in the corner as if forgotten by the world.",
  ["758"]="Reward Obtained",
  ["7580"]="You feel rejuvenated after a short rest. \
 For some reason, the eagle emblem on the statue seems oddly familiar to you.",
  ["7581"]="A girl as blank as a sheet of paper stands at the door, seemingly waiting for a long time. Upon seeing you, she slowly steps forward.",
  ["7582"]="The girl nods, and the eight-petal golden flower by her ear glimmers faintly.",
  ["7583"]="With feelings of dread, you enter the old man's room. After patiently listening to your doubts, he adjusts his glasses and takes a thick book from the shelf",
  ["7584"]="The old man's teachings benefit you greatly.",
  ["7585"]="\"Don't rush, treat the sickle in your hand as your shadow... Imagine it's not you wielding it, but the tool that follows your movements.\"",
  ["7586"]="The moonlight's guidance yields great rewards for you.",
  ["7587"]="Thanks to the refreshing breeze from the Philistine Sea, you arrive in Delphi half a day ahead of schedule. Scholars have meticulously planned the city, utilizing waterways and buildings to create distinct academic districts based on the Golden Ratio. With some time before the Oracle meeting, you have ample time to explore this scholarly city.",
  ["7588"]="The Mechanical Academy resembles a massive, intricate industrial machine, with its streets, squares, artisans, and students functioning as its parts. Before you depart, a few artisans present you with some small inventions as gifts.",

  ["7591"]="Walking down the streets of Bellefontaine, you notice a painter selling his works. Seeing you, he approaches with a smile, saying he is clearing out his studio's inventory, and you can choose any painting you like.",
  ["7592"]="The painting depicts the Cardinal Mansion of Japheria, with its magnificent courtyards and grand gardens, exuding majesty and sanctity.",
  ["7593"]="The painting shows a large stone tablet beneath Japheth Palace, inscribed with the \"Seven Laws and Seven Virtues\" of Japheth. Though the artist's technique and use of color are somewhat rough, you can still feel a stinging sensation from it, as if being burned.",
  ["7594"]="Noting your lack of interest, the painter turns to another tourist.",
  ["7595"]="While browsing for information, you accidentally click a popup ad. Instantly, your screen fills with ear-piercing sounds and flashing images. \"Want to watch a movie but can't find it?

  ["7602"]="Lost in the desert, you don't feel the heat. Sinking into the deep sea, you can still breathe normally. Strange landscapes flash through your mind, and you gradually realize you might be dreaming.",
  ["7603"]="You wake up suddenly, with lingering memories of your recent experiences. Dreams are extensions of reality, yet you haven't experienced such reality...",
  ["7604"]="The black and red figures outside the window continue to gather, and then you realize that you have unknowingly fallen into Nemesis's ambush.",
  ["7605"]="Using the materials at hand, you set up several simple traps in the room. Taking advantage of the confusion among the thugs, you slip out through the window.",

  ["7607"]="The wishing well glows briefly",
  ["7608"]="The land of Qian is no longer unfamiliar to you, but it is so vast that it would take more than ten years to traverse the entire country. This time, you pass by a village and deal with some wolves of unknown origin, earning the villagers' warm hospitality as their benefactor.",

  ["7612"]="You flip through the forbidden book, not noticing when your heartbeat quickens. An uneasy feeling creeps up your spine, and your hands hesitate to turn the next page.",
  ["7613"]="The words seem to dance, and the meaning of the sentence seems ready to sing. Sweat drips down your back, and a sense of desecration feels like it is peeling off your skin.",
  ["7614"]="The passage of time no longer matters. You finish reading it, take a deep breath, and close the book. You feel an unprecedented sense of comfort.",
  ["7615"]="Some books are locked for a reason. Let's go, don't linger too long.",
  ["7616"]="A bustling city doesn't lack museums, and the Hero City of Cyril is no exception.",

  ["7620"]="In the misty haze, a person holding a lantern stands before an open iron gate.",
  ["7621"]="You follow the person into the garden, stepping onto a shaded path with the sounds of flowing water and music in your ears. You walk with him past clocks and groves, but the road ahead still forks.",
  ["7622"]="You realize you don't know how you got here or what happened before you entered.",
  ["7623"]="\"No, I am not traveling,\" the passenger sharing the same carriage with you shook their head.",
  ["7624"]="The box opens, revealing secrets to you. The wanderer's mission is complete, and now it is yours.",
  ["7625"]="\"...I understand.\" The suspicious guy neither coerces nor bargains but leaves directly. Strange things always happen.",
  ["7626"]="The outskirts of Qingyu City at night seem not as quiet as they appear. While walking in the mountains, you hear faint sounds. They are weak but should be human whispers",
  ["7627"]="You explore deeper along the mountain path, finding some lost items along the way. In the moonlight, you see a faint blue reflection.",
  ["7628"]="It is indeed an illusion. After waiting a while, the sounds at your ears disappear.",
  ["7629"]="Polestar vending machines have reached every corner of the world, so seeing one even at the bottom of the Probotis Sea wouldn't be surprising.",
  ["763"]="Gain 5/10 to enhance stage skill effects.",
  ["7630"]="Well, at least it didn't swallow your coins. Only then do you notice that the vending machine has no brand label or complaint hotline.",
  ["7631"]="Be cautious of consumerism traps; you're always right.",
  ["7632"]="The Hephaestus fire has burned day and night for a thousand years, and the forging in the entire Mechanicus district seems never to cease. The art of forging is about precision, planning, reorganization, and renewal, honed through generations of effort ",
  ["7633"]="You pick up a forging tool, its handle still scorching hot. Perhaps you can reshape yourself as well and seek meaning again.",
  ["7634"]="The city's forging and expansion continue. You don't need to become part of it.",
  ["7635"]="Many people imagine the wonderful scenery around the world, but only a few act on it and embark on a global journey. A chance encounter with someone along the way is even rarer. Yet, perhaps due to some psychological effect, you feel as if you have seen this traveler before.",
  ["7636"]="You accepted the gift, quite certain he is just an ordinary person.",
  ["7637"]="After parting ways, you will probably never meet again.",
  ["7638"]="Droughts are not uncommon in any inland area, and the Western Regions are no exception. People always have different ideas on how to combat natural disasters. Precious time ticks away, yet the villagers have not reached a consensus.",
  ["7639"]="With your help, the locals dug a well and managed to survive the rainless drought season.",
  ["764"]="Time Freeze Style",
  ["7640"]="Some indeed agree with your suggestion, but others insist on stayingthey simply cannot leave.",
  ["7641"]="The manager of the Florentine Bank glances at your card spending records, lost in thought. You wish the atmosphere weren't so awkward, but right now, \"cash flow issues\" are the pressing concern you need to address. If left unresolved, your upcoming plans will be disrupted.",
  ["7642"]="Thank you for your cooperation; it has been a pleasure working with you.",
  ["7643"]="You rejected the proposal and decided to think of another solution.",
  ["7644"]="Cyril has entered winter, and its sharp winds serve as its welcome. It's said that art enthusiasts worldwide must visit the Bogolia Grand Theatre at least once in their lifetime.",
  ["7645"]="It is quite warm inside the grand theater. The concerto is romantic and light, graceful yet dynamic, representing love and joy. It is dedicated to both the ordinary and the extraordinary.",
  ["7646"]="The sound of the violin drifted and swirled in the cold night wind. Alone, with only your shadow, the world felt desolate. The solo continued until midnight snow began to fall. You heard it until the end. Before leaving, the performer handed all the coins from the violin case to you.",
  ["7647"]="Indeed. What you pursue is something else.",
  ["7648"]="Why does Polestar's aid supply box also have a lottery mechanism? You don't understand, but the aid box is right in front of you. Now, you need to decide how to obtain the supplies.",
  ["7649"]="You made your choice.",
  ["765"]=" R. Power",
  ["7650"]="This is also your choice.",
  ["7651"]="\"Boom!\" You blast open a warehouse door of Nemesis, feeling quite satisfied. The mission is progressing smoothly, but those distracted guys will soon notice. The warehouse in front of you holds many valuable items. What will you choose?",
  ["7652"]="A small gain. Meanwhile, the night wind howls outside the warehouse.",
  ["7653"]="A bountiful harvest. But your time to retreat is becoming more pressing.",
  ["7654"]="\"Over here!\" The shout announces that the enemy has discovered your trail.",
  ["7655"]="This will do. Mission complete.",
  ["7656"]="The corner of the square in front of Japheth Palace is unusually lively today, with someone passionately speaking about how the existence of the noble class oppresses the rights of the common people. This topic never gets old.",
  ["7657"]="She expressed her gratitude for your attention to her speech and said, \"Japheth belongs to all Japhians.\"",
  ["7658"]="Of course. You are not.",

  ["7661"]="There is no doubt that they are contaminated.",
  ["7662"]="Just outside Delphi's academic city, two curious children stand by the riverbank, studying the flowing river.",
  ["7663"]="The icy river water washes over your legs, and every step across the river is accompanied by pain. Nonetheless, you manage to make it across.",
  ["7664"]="The icy river water washes over your legs, and every step you take is accompanied by pain. After experiencing it yourself, you are convinced there is no other river as freezing as this. You made it.",
  ["7665"]="They have nothing to do with you. Don't worry about irrelevant matters.",
  ["7666"]="As Night falls, you come across a traveler's cabin. People gathered around a table, huddling together to pass the time after sunset. What better way to kill time than with a game?",

Eme-an could not find anyone related to her, and even in the Babel Library, which contains all the information in the world, there was no trace of her background. This sparked many speculations and discussions. However, Cosmos, gentle as always, refused to answer any questions this time, and Zero stayed in the Babel Tower, rarely stepping into the outside world.

Initially, the two clashed due to their contrasting personalities, but eventually, Xin accepted Qing's proposal and joined WeiShi. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>To help Xin better integrate into CangLin City, Qing not only had her join WeiShi but also arranged for her to work at a street office near the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity, where she serves as a coordinator responsible for maintaining public order.

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Now, Xin is like a child stepping out of the wilderness and embracing the world for the first time.

  ["8222"]="The Red-Haired Stranger Reappears on the Streets: Hero or Villain?\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Recently, the enigmatic \"Fiery-Haired Phantom\" has resurfaced on Fengnan Street! Known for appearing and vanishing without a trace, this mysterious figure, identifiable by its fiery red hair and remarkable agility, remains an enigma with an unknown name and affiliation. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The Fiery-Haired Phantom has been particularly active lately, with numerous street residents reporting sightings. Our agency conducted exclusive interviews with some of these witnesses. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Uncle Qian, a security guard: \"Well, I heard someone shouting 'My wallet was stolen!', and immediately, a red blur darted forward. I didn't even see the thief's face before this unfortunate kid was dangling in the air like a chicken. I can still remember that blood-curdling scream...\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Aunt Wang from the flower shop: \"Last time, my cat Mimi climbed a tree and was too scared to come down. I called the street office for help, but before anyone arrived, that red figure flew from my balcony to the tree and brought the cat down. Mimi was fine, but my poor chrysanthemums on the balcony were nearly trampled into the soil.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Nurse Luo: \"That day, the Qi family's child had a high fever, and there was a major traffic jam. We had no choice but to seek help from the community. Shortly after we hung up the phone, the red-haired figure appeared, grabbed the child, and dashed to the hospital as if flying over roofs and walls, saving the day! The only issue is the families in those buildings are quite upset because you can still see shoe prints on their walls.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>All evidence suggests that while the Fiery-Haired Phantom performs good deeds, their actions are often reckless, causing significant trouble while helping residents. Some say he is from a foreign land, dedicated to acts of chivalry; others believe he is closely connected to the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity, always escaping unscathed from major incidents. Another theory claims he is just an unemployed wanderer, acting purely on whims. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Regardless of the truth, our reporters will continue to follow this story, bringing readers the latest updates on the person behind the red hair.",
  ["8223"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>To survive in the harsh wilderness of the Western Region, one must not only know how to extract resources from the barren land but also how to protect their food supply from the ever-changing weather. Without proper treatment, the hard-earned food would quickly spoil due to moisture and temperature fluctuations. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The food processing methods in the Western Region are quite unique. Locals often use boiling, fermenting, smoking, or drying techniques to make various ingredients into storable food. Xin learned these simple yet rugged cooking techniques from her parents at a young age, enabling her to survive in the wilderness for several years. Whether it was tree bark, wild fruits, insects, or weeds, Xin could turn them into edible dishes. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After arriving in CangLin City, despite having access to a variety of ingredients and stable preservation technology, Xin continued to use her simple and direct cooking methods from the wilderness, creating bizarre dishes from various ingredients.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Stir-frying chili peppers with durian gives you a spicy and sweet flavor!\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"That wild herb is a bit bitter, so add some chocolate when you make a hot pot!\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Just hearing Xin talk about her recipes could send shivers down anyone's spine. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Surprisingly, while her dishes might look and smell terrible, they often tasted quite good. Xin compiled her experiences with different ingredients into a recipe book. According to her, the book records the flavors, toxicities, and cooking methods of over a hundred types of food. To outsiders, however, it appears to be a small booklet filled with doodles, short sentences, and misspellings.",
  ["8224"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>As Qian steps into a new era, it places significant emphasis on public education. To date, Qian's education system covers everything from kindergarten to university graduation. The educational philosophy is that everyone should have equal access to education and the freedom to choose their own path. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Naturally, Xin, who is illiterate and lacks basic common sense, feels out of place in CangLin City. Helping Xin adapt to modern life has become a challenging task for Qing. Xin's basic knowledge is so lacking that she can't recognize simple alphabets, understand basic concepts, or even read or write her own name. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Qing initially considered enrolling Xin in a professional educational institution. However, the moment Xin saw the small chairs in the classroom and the children she would be studying with, she left without looking back. Besides providing education, Qing had to consider Xin's self-esteem as an overage student. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>In the end, Qing decided to carve out time from her busy schedule to personally teach Xin to read and write. From literacy to etiquette, from history and mythology to natural science, Qing spared no effort in teaching her everything she deemed important or anything that piqued her interest. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Although the process was arduous, Xin gradually learned some basic words. However, due to Qing's busy schedule, these private lessons were often interrupted. Qing had to leave the study materials in Xin's room, encouraging her to study on her own after their sessions. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>During her free time, Xin occasionally picked up the materials with confidence and tried to study on her own. However, more often than not, she would fall asleep within five minutes of opening the books.",

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, when Cosmos unexpectedly adopted Zero and named her as his successor, Ereshan's life was torn in two. Before that day, she was an outstanding and dedicated librarian. Afterward, she began to show a more cynical side of her nature. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ereshan made no effort to hide her disdain and stopped referring to Cosmos as her grandfather from the moment Zero arrived. She started taking long-term assignments away from the Babel Tower, avoiding returning whenever possible.

  ["8226"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Florence di Cosimo de' Florentine, a member of the Cardinal Court in the Holy Cardinal Nation of Japheth, the youngest cardinal in history, the current Duchess of the Florentine family, chairman of the Florentine Banking Group, and honorary dean of \"Spring\" at the Bellefontaine Academy of Arts. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>This string of titles is only part of the honors and responsibilities she has inherited. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Nineteen years ago, amidst joyous prayers, Florence was born. As the sun rose over the horizon, her father lifted her up towards the window. When she opened her eyes for the first time, she saw the most beautiful scenery in the worldBellefontaine. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>According to the ancient and solemn rituals of Japhetic Ethics, little Florence was baptized in the presence of seven elders. She was enviable, for she was to become the heir to one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Japh and the worldthe Florentines.",
  ["8227"]="(Bellefontaine Report, March 14) Recently, both the market and the public have been closely watching the developments in Japh. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>During his lifetime, Cosimo kept his family away from the media, so little information about his daughter Florence was publicly available. Since Cosimo's death on February 10, Florence has not made any public appearances for over a month. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, this low profile may soon end, as March 15 is the third Wednesday of March, the most important traditional festival in Japhthe Oath Festival. Traditionally, the Duke of Florence should appear at the Oath Festival celebration. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>As part of the necessary education for the Duke's heir, she was sent to the \"Spring\" Academy, an artistic sanctuary established by the Florentine family, where she received rigorous vocal training. Photos of the six-year-old Florence can be found in the Academy's annual new student group photos. However, her absence in the graduation photos over the years has never been officially addressed by either the Duke's office or the Academy. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>An anonymous individual who attended the Academy with Florence revealed to this newspaper (confirmed through investigation that this person indeed appears in the freshman group photo with Florence) that Florence was very diligent during her time at the Academy, receiving much praise from her teachers. Only once was she severely reprimandedon that day, the teacher discovered Florence had copied a bizarre piece of music onto her sheet music. The melody was extremely jarring, dissonant, and even terrifying, conjuring thoughts of wailing, blood, and broken bones. The teacher, furious, described it as \"straight from hell\" and demanded to know where Florence had copied it from. At that moment, the Florentine family housekeeper, who was supposed to wait outside, entered the room, politely apologized to the teacher, and took Florence away. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The anonymous source stated that this was the last time they saw Florence in a music class at the academy. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>This newspaper contacted Florentine Bank to inquire whether Duchess Florence would attend the Oath Festival celebration, but Florentine Bank refused to comment on non-business matters.",
  ["8228"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Upon assuming the title of Duchess of Florentine, Florence also inherited many of her father's wishes, one of which is now known to the world as the Grand Basilica of Flowers. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, the Grand Basilica of Flowers was not built by Florence's father; its design originated from a previous Duke of Florentine generations ago. Over the years, the Basilica has remained unfinished. Since its inception, the Cardinal Court has resisted the project, mainly on the grounds that it \"disrespects Japhetic Ethics.\" By the time of Florence's father, the Court's opposition had nearly turned hostile. To ease tensions between the Florentine family and the Court, construction of the Basilica had to be halted multiple times. The frequent stoppages led the public to question what was really happening between the Cardinals and the Duke. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Perhaps as compensation for the long delays, successive Florentine dukes added their own ideas to the design during the downtime. However, this only made each subsequent construction phase longer. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After taking over as Duke, Florence decided to take the design of the Grand Basilica of Flowers out of the Florentine mansion's study and publicly exhibit it in Bellefontaine. She invited artists and architects from all over Japh to contribute more beautiful designs, which led to a new peak in criticism from the Cardinal Court. Many described Florence's actions as blasphemy against Japhetic Ethics, but Florence responded: \"This is a beautiful gift from Bellefontaine to Japhetic Ethics, and I hope it will be completed by the hands of Bellefontaine's people.\"",
  ["8229"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Florence regularly wears a ring engraved with the Florentine family crest. According to Japhian etiquette, the ring signifies the Duke's status and should be worn on the left pinky finger. However, Florence prefers to wear it on her index finger for reasons unknown. Observant individuals might notice that even on her index finger, the ring seems slightly loose, indicating that it was not originally made for her slender hands. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The Florentine family operates its own intelligence network, an open secret in Japh. Although the Cardinal Court might not openly acknowledge it, even the Cardinals sometimes rely on the Florentines' well-informed network. According to legend, the most classified information in this intelligence system is sealed with the Duke's signet ring, following ancient secrecy rules: written only on paper, sealed in a locked box, and delivered by trusted hands. This practice gave rise to the Japhian saying \"sealed with the Florentine ring\", implying a foolproof secret. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The outer side of the Florentine signet ring is engraved with the maxim: \"Japhetic Ethics is the most beautiful, and the most beautiful is Japhetic Ethics.\" According to tradition, the Duke of Florence, when making the most solemn promises, would clasp their hands and kiss the ring on their index finger, symbolizing a vow made with the credibility of the Florentine name, personal honor, and the Duke's status, pledging before Japhetic Ethics with no chance of reneging. Thus, each Duke's crest ring has witnessed their coronation and wedding ceremonies. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Florence has removed this ring in front of only a few people, so few are aware of the inscription inside. No one knows what feelings led her to engrave those words herself.",

  ["8230"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Asti was born in a winery in Moscato. After losing her parents, she was adopted by the Florentine family. Following a series of studies and assessments, she became an apprentice housekeeper, serving Florence since childhood. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The role of housekeeper for the Florentine family is a significant responsibility. Each housekeeper's final duty before retirement is to prepare their successor, a task executed flawlessly by predecessors until the sudden death of the previous housekeeper. At that time, Florence, having just become a duchess, received numerous recommendations for housekeeper candidates from within and outside the family. However, the duchess chose none of them, opting instead for Asti, whose only listed experience was \"apprentice housekeeper\" and who lacked any additional background. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Asti became the youngest person ever to assume the role of housekeeper for the Florentine family. Her appointment initially sparked criticism and caused those who met her to underestimate her due to her age and appearance. However, she soon demonstrated skills and sophistication that contradicted her youthful looks, rekindling the fear and respect people once had for the Florentine housekeeper.",
  ["8231"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Moscato grapes are one of the common grape varieties in Japh and are a specialty of Asti's hometown. While they can be eaten fresh, they are mostly processed into various wines and juices, becoming indispensable beverages in the daily lives of Japhians. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>During the Oath Festival, only baptized Japhians are eligible to receive \"Holy Wine\"a specially made grape juice used to give thanks to the Supreme Deity and honor Japhetic Ethics. This \"Holy Wine\" also symbolizes the blood of the Supreme Deity, with the belief that \"He blesses Japh with His blood\". Moscato grapes are a key ingredient in this sacred grape juice. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Asti received \"Holy Wine\" as a child. Perhaps due to the special production process or the deep-rooted piety of Japhians towards Japhetic Ethics, the \"Holy Wine\" far surpassed ordinary grape juice. The joy and unique taste of the \"Holy Wine\" left a lasting impression on her, though she eventually lost this privilege. As a result, Asti initially felt resistant to the ritual. However, without going into how she ultimately reconciled with it, it should be noted that she never blamed the grape juice itself from beginning to end.",
  ["8232"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Among the many responsibilities handled by the Florentine family housekeeper, hosting a grand banquet is the most intricate. Every detail, from the theme and guest list to etiquette standards, must be flawless. Most aspects are manageable, except for the guest list, which requires careful consideration due to the fluctuating status of the Japhian nobility, influenced by factors such as wealth. To avoid any social missteps, Asti personally created a guest list that she updates regularly. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Aside from the basic information in this list, it also includes some unpublished data obtained through special means, such as affiliations, illicit assets, personal habits, peculiar preferences, dark histories, and any disrespect shown toward the Florentine family. Asti has meticulously noted these details and, for reasons unknown, even added special doodles to many entries. As the list grows, it appears to be hinting at a possible vendetta list.",
  ["8233"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>After becoming an apprentice butler, Asti's responsibilities increased. Besides the visible daytime duties, she also handled some family affairs under the cover of night. Many nights, she would secretly leave the Florentine estate and return before dawn, never leaving a trace. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>As she became more adept at her tasks, she also grew fond of the solitude of night walks. Unlike the tense daytime, she could enjoy the different scenery that midnight offered. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>During the day, Bellefontaine is a bustling art center, filled with crowds and dazzling light. At midnight, under the moonlight, it becomes serene, with the shadows adding depth and mystery, enchanting her. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Even on nights without tasks, Asti would go out for nocturnal strolls, carefully concealing her presence to remain unseen. She has occasionally invited a few people to join her, wanting to share the beauty of midnight Bellefontaine, saying, \"Just by changing the time, the familiar world becomes entirely different.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Of course, these invitations are rare. Besides the hassle of covering tracks, not everyone is willing to sacrifice precious sleep for a nighttime adventure. As a result, the Florentine housekeeper has a significant need for coffee. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Now that you know this secret, would you like to join me for a walk tonight? It's just one night without sleep.\"",
  ["8234"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ming was born into a family with a long-standing tradition. Families like hers were once common in Qian, but now they find themselves in an awkward position. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>In today's Qian, an ideal state without the need for noble families, anything associated with these old familiesrules, customs, and even the families themselveshas been largely abandoned, often labeled as \"feudal superstitions\". Ming's family traditionally provided a wide range of services, such as I Ching divination, feng shui, and funeral rites, all of which are now linked to these discarded \"old things\". Though they may seem outdated and are no longer understood by many, Ming firmly believes that not all old things are meaningless. If we completely abandon the past, how can we move steadily forward? \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"We may no longer need them, but that doesn't mean we should forget their existence,\" she often says. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The responsibilities of her family's business, tasks from WeiShi, and her advisory role to the Department of Governmental Affairs all consume a significant amount of Ming's energy. Amidst these heavy responsibilities, she devotes whatever strength she has left to recovering those ancient items that have been carelessly lost over the ages.",
  ["8235"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>To address the frequent anomalies in QingYu City and gather relevant intelligence, WeiShi and the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity have teamed up, offering various forms of assistance, with Ming being a key contributor. Dispatched by WeiShi, Ming serves as a special Folk Affairs Advisor to the Bureau in QingYu City. In addition to her primary duties for WeiShi, she also creates folklore-related educational materials for the Bureau's publicity department to prevent criminals from exploiting anomalies for fraudulent purposes. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>A citizen who was nearly swindled presented this banner. He explained that he was on the verge of handing over his entire fortune to fraudsters, but the daily science updates from the Bureau's publicity department saved him just in time. Grateful, he had this exquisite banner made and personally delivered it to the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity in QingYu City to express his thanks. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Based on the information from the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity, the expert might look like a 'mystic', but everything she says is grounded in scientific principles! It was incredibly convincing! I owe the safety of my wealth to this 'mystic', I mean, expert! Thank you, Bureau of Oversight & Integrity! Thank you to the 'mystic' expert from the Bureau!\" the grateful citizen told reporters. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ming later declined interviews and photo requests from both reporters and the grateful citizen, citing her busy work schedule.",
  ["8236"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ming knows how to tie many types of knots, but if you ask her to demonstrate, the result might not be very impressive. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>In traditional Qian culture, it was common for elders to give handmade knots to children as a symbol of protection and well-wishes for their growth. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Growing up with her grandparents, Ming was always well cared for by the elderly neighbors who treated her like their own granddaughter. They gave her numerous handmade knots, each beautifully crafted and filled with heartfelt meanings.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>One day, after having given her various knots, the elders seemed to have collectively found a new hobby: teaching Ming how to tie these knots herself. While Ming excelled at gathering and organizing information, she struggled with the actual knot-tying, a rare setback for her. Perhaps it was due to the impatience of other young people, or maybe Ming's patience with the elders made them more eager to help. In any case, they would gather at Ming's home, teaching her knot-tying step by step. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The elders enjoyed seeing Ming's rare moments of clumsiness and cherished those warm afternoons spent guiding her. And Ming? She didn't mind those times either.",
  ["8237"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ming's family business originally covered a wide range of traditional practices, including I Ching divination, feng shui, and funeral rites. From a young age, Ming had been studying the ancient knowledge passed down in her family. In the realm of divination alone, there were dozens of methods. This wisdom, originating from ancient civilizations, is profound and complex, difficult to interpret through modern logic. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>For contemporary Qian, these practices are seen as relics of the past that should have been discarded long ago. The only aspect that remains somewhat viable today is the practice of funeral rites.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Although Ming does not agree that these ancient practices should be abandoned, she has nonetheless placed them all out of sight overnight and rarely reveals them to others. Unless necessary, she avoids displaying these skillswhether this is due to the complexity and hassle of the procedures is unknown. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Even when she is willing to perform a divination, she rarely discloses the results to others. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Knowing some omens of good or bad fortune in advance doesn't necessarily mean anything. Who can say if a setback won't turn into a blessing? But for you no matter how hard I try to divine for you I always can't determine the outcome.\"",

After workif she ever manages to leave on timeshe often competes in ground calligraphy with the elderly in the square, wielding a giant brush with ease.

The daily affairs of the CangLin municipal government are extremely busy, and the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity, tasked with ensuring the propriety of its colleagues, is never idle. When Qing first arrived, the various departments of the CangLin municipal government regarded this new Zhi jing with some condescension, given their perception of her inexperience. However, they quickly experienced the other side of Qing's refined and elegant demeanora face of impartiality and swift action. If Qing did not receive satisfactory answers when politely inquiring the first time, she would return with documents, records, and accounts unearthed by the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity, leaving no room for evasion or obfuscation. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Because of her work style, Qing has almost never left work on time. Her office is perpetually piled high with documents awaiting her attention. Rumors from the Bureau of Talent & Recruitment suggest that if her overtime were converted into years of service, Secretary Qing would have over twenty years of seniority, making her a senior to more than half of the staff at CangLin municipal government. Additionally, it's said that the accumulated vacation time and compensatory leave owed to Secretary Qing total up to ten months. Occasionally, when the pressure becomes too much, Qing files a request for full leave in a fit of frustration, but each time the Bureau of Talent & Recruitment rejects it, citing that if Secretary Qing were to leave her post for more than half a month, the efficiency of CangLin municipal government would drop by sixty percent.",
  ["824"]="Clue",
  ["8240"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>In the corner of Qing's office stands a giant brush almost as tall as her, with the words \"Taihao\" engraved on its handle. After workon the rare occasions when she leaves on timeQing loves visiting the square. Thanks to the rich cultural heritage of the Jiangyin region, the squares of CangLin City are always filled with elderly people practicing ground calligraphy. Qing often joins them with her \"Taihao.\" The elders praise her strength but critique her lack of subtlety, saying, \"She has the strength but lacks finesse.\" Qing's inner emotions are vividly reflected in her writing, not only because of her forceful strokes that seem to slice through the ground but also due to the harsh words she writeswords out of character for her usual demeanor and unsuitable for municipal government meetings. Fortunately, these words evaporate with the water in seconds, and Qing's expression gradually returns to its calm and composed state.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Few people know that Qing's practice of ground calligraphy is also a way to train her swordsmanship.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>In the distant past, Qian referred to Qing's profession as \"scholar-warrior\"an official proficient in both pen and sword. It is an astonishing coincidence because her current job requires the use of both pen and sword.",
  ["8241"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Shortly after joining CangLin municipal government, Qing quickly stood out for her exceptional analytical and processing skills, becoming a rising star within the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity. Not long after, an organization previously unknown to Qing approached her, calling itself WeiShi. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Out of caution and rationality, Qing did not fully trust the \"world behind history\" they presented to her. Instead, her first assumption was that they had ulterior motives, possibly trying to extract information from the municipal government staff. So she spent a considerable amount of effort investigating this organization, only to find that outside of what they willingly showed her, there was no trace of WeiShi's existence in society. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Just when Qing was at her wit's end, WeiShi visited her again. In a modest yet elegant courtyard, Qing met the person who would change the course of her life: Yuanquan, the leader of WeiShi. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Faced with Qing's rapid-fire questions, Yuanquan responded only with a gentle smile. \"What is the truth depends on what you perceive and how you interpret the connections between things. WeiShi does not require you to accept our version of the 'world', but since you are now aware of its existence, how will you explain it?\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Yuanquan praised Qing for her skepticism and investigation, saying that the spirit of seeking truth is exactly what WeiShi needs. Then Yuanquan offered her two choices: leave the courtyard and return to her previous life, with WeiShi disappearing from her life as if it had never appeared, or stay and join them, becoming a mirror reflecting the long history of Qian. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Driven by immense confusion, curiosity, and anticipation, Qing chose the latter. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Very well, you will have time to understand your new responsibilities later. For now, choose a self-defense weaponno, not what you're used to, as those won't work against anomalies\". As he spoke, Yuan Quan ordered several weapons to be brought out for Qing to choose from. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>From the start, there was only one choice in Qing's eyes: a green long sword with a simple design, almost as tall as she was. For some reason, Qing felt an unusual sense of familiarity with this sword, as if she had known it in another life. She grasped the hilt, finding it much lighter than she had expected. She carefully stroked the sharp edge, but the blade suddenly cut her finger, and her blood mysteriously merged into the green blade, disappearing instantly. Turning the hilt, Qing saw the name of the sword, \"Qingyan\" engraved on it, along with four faint seal script characters she could not decipher. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"'Sever the Connection Between Heaven and Earth',\" Yuanquan sighed behind her as if something long suspected had been confirmed. \"Qingyan is yours now. Be careful, its color is given by blood\". \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Qing looked at the green sword, confused. \"Is there green blood in this world?\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Since you've touched the other side of history, you'll have to think about these questions yourself\", Yuanquan replied with a gentle smile. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>From then on, Qing spent considerable effort tracing the legacy of Qingyan. Historical records offered only vague hints pointing back to antiquity, to the time of the first emperor of the ancient Qian Empire, but no further clues were found.",
  ["8242"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Sapphira, the foremost smith in Delphi.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>While studying at the Delphi Institute of Mechanics, she consistently applied for and passed exams to skip grades. During her studies, she made research contributions substantial enough to qualify as a professor. After graduating, she quickly became a fellow, earning the title of the youngest fellow in the institution's history. Shortly after, she was recruited by the Delphic Oracle.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>On the day of her graduation, she submitted an application to become the custodian of Hephaestus's Fire. Once approved, she established her research lab near the fire, expertly balancing her scientific work with the daily oversight of this crucial resource. Before long, her public information certification was updated, and she officially adopted the codename \"Hephae\".\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Some speculate that Hephae's fascination with the Fire stems from its connection to her research focus. Others believe it arises from the admiration for Hephaestus ingrained in all Mechanical Academy students. Perhaps these speculations are not entirely accurate.",
  ["8243"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Smelting is a rather niche discipline at the Mechanical Academy. Its high technical and physical demands, particularly the significant strength required which can only be developed through repetitive physical training, make most students of the Delphi Society shy away. However, Sapphira firmly chose smelting as her field of study early on. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Initially, her lack of physical strength posed a significant barrier, but she never regretted her choice. To increase her strength, she developed and strictly adhered to a rigorous training regimen. While her frequent grade-skipping was already a hot topic among her peers, her regular visits to the gym earned her even more respect. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Despite her persistent efforts, her progress in smelting remained slow for a considerable time. She even sought advice from the Medical Academy and realized that human strength (at least her own) had its limits. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, her strength training did not cease, and soon after, her journey in smelting unexpectedly became smoother. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"It must be because Senior Sapphira's relentless training led to a breakthrough in her strength!\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"So muscles don't necessarily equate to strength! Look at Senior Sapphira! Her slender build can still wield immense power!\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>When Sapphira saw discussions about herself on the Truth Forum, she quietly canceled her plan to publicly announce the exclusive lightweight hammering technique, opting for a more low-key approach. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>When someone later saw Sapphira effortlessly wielding a giant hammer, the rumors of her great strength intensified sparking heated debates among students on the Truth Altar, but that is a story for another time.",
  ["8244"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The transformation of energy has always been ongoing, but regardless of technological advancements, for Delphi, the embodiment of energy is the Fire of Hephaestus. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>If other people burn wood, they add firewood to Hephaestus' Fire. If they use nuclear energy, they incorporate the latest nuclear conversion technology into the fire. All their technology, manpower, and financial resources are dedicated to this fire, generation after generation, making the enormous brazier at the center of the Mechanicus District the pinnacle of contemporary human technology. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Such an important technological marvel naturally requires constant supervision, but the \"ordinary\" and \"boring\" daily supervisory work has always struggled to attract enthusiasm in a place teeming with geniuses like Delphi. \
 When the current guardian of Hephaestus' Fire showed signs of leaving, the management issued a job posting early on. However, after a long time, they received only one application, which was immediately rejected because the applicant was too youngshe hadn't even graduated from the academy. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The applicant, Sapphira, did not give up. To achieve her goal, she quickly devised a new plan and immediately put it into action. The result was remarkable, as she significantly shortened her student career to achieve it. It was a period that left every Delphi Academy student speechless with surprise. For Sapphira, however, it still felt too long, as she worried someone else might submit an application before her. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Finally, after her graduation ceremony, she rushed to submit her second job application before even changing her clothes. \"As far as I know, you are the youngest graduate in Delphi Society's history. This morning was your graduation ceremony, and everyone expected you to submit your research project. Instead... you ran over here to apply for the position of guardian of Hephaestus' Fire?\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Sapphira nodded repeatedly, gasping for breath. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Supervising the Fire of Hephaestus doesn't require much technical skill. Are you aware of this?\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Still breathless, Sapphira could only nod continuously. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"I have received your application... I'm looking forward to your performance.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Shortly after, the Fire of Hephaestus had a new guardian. Sapphira's finally got what she wanted.",
  ["8245"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>In Delphi, most research-related work is documented using audio recordings. Here is a recording of a conversation during a shift changeover for the supervision of the Fire of Hephaestus: \

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"...It's required.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Every evening, you carefully and kindly hand over the supervision of the Fire of Hephaestus to me, explaining everything in detail!\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"It's just part of the job...\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Under your sturdy hammer, beautiful and practical creations are born. Your sapphire-like eyes reflect the fire of Hephaestus, and the sense of security when you effortlessly swing that giant hammer!\" \

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"...It... it was quite tasty... Ugh... Forgive me, Fire of Hephaestus...\" \

  ["8246"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Logos is a student at the Delphi School of Philosophy, the head of the Delphi Society, and the youngest member of the Delphic Oracle in nearly a century. Known for her exceptional character and academic excellence, she is held in high regard by the Society due to her innate talents. Her name, derived from an ancient language, signifies \"speech, law, philosophy, and reason\". \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>As the head student, Logos bears significant responsibilities. he must create the duty roster for all Delphi students, assign roles and responsibilities, and oversee whether students from various faculties are fulfilling their duties. The complexity of this task is evident, considering that Delphi is home to some of the world's brightest, most energetic, and least conventional minds.",
  ["8247"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>According to tradition, the final stage of the Delphi Society's entrance exam  the interview  is held at the Altar of Wisdom in the Philosophia District. This ancient marble relic features a statue of Pallas, the god of wisdom worshipped by the ancient Delphians. Weathered by millennia of wind, frost, and rain, the statue's face is now indistinct. Although some have suggested restoring it, generations of scholars argue that the statue's blurred visage perfectly represents the ambiguity of philosophy, which can only be clarified through profound thought, not with a hammer and chisel.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>At the age of 14, Logos ascended the Altar of Wisdom to face the final question before entering Delphi. Legend has it that this question has remained unchanged for millennia.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The ravages of time had shrouded Pallas's statue in a thick veil, and the featureless eyes gazed down upon the young Logos as the statue spoke:\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"I am the god of omniscience. I can answer any question you ask, but once you know the answer, you must die. What will you do?\"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>This statue is a masterpiece created by craftsmen from the Mechanicus District, with gears and springs embedded centuries ago that still function, enabling it to speak. In the information age, geeks from the Mathematica District even added sophisticated AI chips to the statue. Depending on the questions asked by prospective students, the statue can give various responses, adding a touch of humor and wit to this serious exam.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"You should go to a church. They answer such questions for free, while professors at the Academy of Philosophy charge a fee.\"  In response to \"Does God really exist?\"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"In simple terms, I suggest you earn more money. The satisfaction money can buy is beyond your imagination.\"  In response to \"How can I become fulfilled?\"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"You might as well take me down and stand here in my place, taking over my job.\"  In response to \"How can I know the truth?\"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Most people would ponder for a while after hearing Pallas's question, but Logos responded almost immediately:\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Please provide a mode of thinking that is both rigorously logical and morally sound, capable of yielding the optimal solution in any complex situation.\"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Pallas then fell silent for a long time. Just when Logos thought she had been rejected by the Delphi Society, the statue spoke again in a cheerful tone: \"Young girl, go to the School of Philosophy. There, you will find many who are willing to risk their lives for the answer to this question.\"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Subsequently, Logos was formally admitted to the Delphi Academy of Philosophy.",
  ["8248"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>As the Head Prefect of the Delphi Society, Logos held herself to an almost perfectionist standard, exhibiting a rare passion for all subjects. Few students shared her equal enthusiasm for every discipline. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>She immersed herself not only in highly logical subjects such as mathematics and physics but also in the romantic arts like painting and music. Before the final exam for her harp solo course, she commissioned craftsmen from the Mechanicus District to forge her custom-designed harp, \"Muse\". The blueprint for \"Muse\" was detailed down to the specific alloy proportions for each segment of the strings to produce the exact sound she envisioned. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After the solo exam, the professor awarded Logos a well-deserved high score. But as Logos bowed and turned to leave the stage, the professor stopped her, saying, \"Child, this is the first time I've heard this piece. What is it called?\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"I composed it myself, and it's titled 'Thought'.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Why did you choose my course?\" the professor asked. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Because I love music,\" Logos replied sincerely. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"And why do you love music?\" the professor continued. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Because the essence of music is mathematics, and the essence of mathematics is pure logic,\" Logos answered. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"I see.\" The professor nodded. \"Then I suggest that you should not take any more music courses at the Delphi Society.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Why?\" Logos asked, taken aback. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"You are not meant to play our kind of music. Don't worry, I'm not criticizing you, child. We use mathematical tools and theories to compose music, but the aesthetic beauty we aim for has little to do with mathematics. However, you are different. I can sense that your thinking is like a complex set of gears, each moving precisely as programmed. Even in your performance, what flows from your strings is not an auditory melody but a geometric rhythm. You use your fingers to segment the strings, not to play them; you are delineating and analyzing, not expressing or emoting. I'm not criticizing you,\" the professor repeated. \"The core of your music has nothing to do with art or our concept of 'beauty'. Therefore, we, who study aesthetics, cannot help you progress further. That's all there is to it. This harp is excellent; do not let it gather dust. Continue creating your music in your own way. Perhaps your music can indeed come closer to human thought than ours.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>From then on, Logos never set foot in another music class at Delphi, but she heeded the professor's advice and kept Muse with her always.",
  ["8249"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Logos' bookshelf sees a frequent rotation of books, with the exception of one thick ancient Delphi dictionary that has never been replaced.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>This dictionary was the only book she'd brought with her when she was admitted to Delphi and moved into the society's dormitory. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>On the book's title page, a line of slightly sloppy handwriting reads: \"It is said that this language was created by the ancient gods themselves, containing their secrets and powers. It was abandoned by people because they could not understand its true meaning. Perhaps you will be smarter than I am, my dearest\"\

<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The page with \"Logos\" appears to have been splashed with water at some point, leaving a small, crinkled mark. The printed word on this wrinkled part is \"\", which translates to \"forgetting,\" \"blankness,\" \"lesson,\" or \"new beginning.\"",

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>When he left the library, the young man was already wearing a mask that covered half his face. With Cosmos's approval, he joined Eme-an. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Over time, the young man demonstrated remarkable talent in laws, rules, and regulations, displaying maturity and sophistication far beyond his age. Gradually, the members of Eme-an began to seek his help with unsolvable problems, and his responses never disappointed. Slowly, he became known as the enforcer and spokesperson of the law among the members. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>At some point, the members of Eme-an began to call him by an ancient nameShamash. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>In the now-lost ancient Obed language, Shamash symbolized the sun, wisdom, insight, and Just Verdict, a fitting name for one devoted to the law.",
  ["8251"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>To better fulfill his duties, Shamash set up a bronze box in the entrance hall of the Babel Tower. Anyone could write letters about their difficulties or complaints and drop them in the box, whether anonymously or not, with no content restrictions. \

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Can we make Monday to Friday rest days and the weekend work days?\"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Can we cancel the list of banned books? Weren't books written to be read?\" \

  ["8252"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>To welcome Shamash into Eme-an, the members of Eme-an gave him a reed pen. Shamash treasured the pen and rarely used it, being just as sparing with his words as with his writing. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>He only used the pen once in front of everyone. That day, after returning from a mission directly ordered by Director Cosmos, he came back to the Babel Tower, badly injured and as silent as always, leaving everyone unaware of what had happened to him. In response to his friends' shock, concern, and greetings, Shamash's only reaction was to set down his stone tablet and crush part of it with his bare hands. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After breaking the Law, Shamash took out the reed pen and inexplicably used its supposedly fragile tip to carve deep words into the hard basalt: \"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The ink was the \"blood\" flowing from his wrist. \

One rumor about the Law Tablet is that Shamash visited an extremely ancient room in the library, which contained legal documents lost at the dawn of history. These documents held countless unknown lies, truths, testimonies, and confessions. The will and power of these texts merged to form the original \"law\" of humanity, manifesting as the Law Tablet. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The golden chain linking the codex and Shamash's right arm cannot be broken, not even by Shamash himself. This seems to be a restraint imposed by the Codex's own will, confirming what Director Erish said about \"language, words, and thoughts having their own power\". \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Several lines of text in the Codex are covered with gold paint and cannot be seen. When someone asked Shamash what was written under the gold, they were met with silence. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Thus, another rumor emerged: those are decrees Shamash personally wrote for someone or something, only to be revealed in critical situations. It seems that even under the sun, there are shadows and secrets.",

 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Performance is for self-expression\", Viola once said when asked why she always performs solo. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>While people were mesmerized by her answer, they couldn't understand that her \"expression\" went far deeper than they could imagine. Her performance skills are extraordinary, and it is rumored that she can convey everything she sees, thinks, and hears through her performance, completely to every listener. \

There have been frequent ominous rumors about Viola's solo concertswhether it was the audience present or her accompanying partners, they all experienced varying degrees of mental disorderhallucinations, sensory disruptions, and abnormal behaviors. A series of bizarre medical reports caused the outside world to become increasingly doubtful. \

Although the recording was successful, due to some uncontrollable factors, the businessman eventually did not manage to take the record with him. After the concert ended, a staff member, considering it an ownerless item, took it to the second-hand market for random disposal. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The record passed through many hands, each owner leaving some marks on it. It was said that these marks were the result of unspeakable horrors they encountered after listening to the record.

The violist on stage was initially unknown, but the moment she drew her bow across the strings, everyone remembered her nameViola. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>This was Viola's debut performance. Her exquisite skills were evident during the first half of the set pieces, showcasing her effortless mastery. However, for a genius, this was merely the beginning. It wasn't until the latter half of the performance that an unfamiliar but enchanting melody flowed from her hands, captivating the ears and hearts of all present. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>In an interview after the performance, when asked why she chose to perform solo, Viola mentioned that she initially joined an orchestra, but an accident during rehearsal led to its early dissolution. This brief and dismal experience did not dampen her passion for music but helped her realize that she was not suited for orchestral playing. She decided to make her mark in the music world as a soloist, and it proved to be the right decision. And now we are fortunate to witness the birth of a genius. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Apart from helping her recognize her path, the former orchestra left Viola with a group photo as a memento. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The figures in the photo are blurry, but you can just make out the young Viola's innocent face in the center of the front row. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Reflecting on this period, Viola gave a novel and humorous response: <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"The wind instrument players mostly thought about what to have for dinner. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The percussionists were always tense, counting the beats. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The string players had varied thoughts; some complained about being busy, some wanted to be in the spotlight, and some were very focused on me. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Although it was a bit noisy, when it was my turn to play, they all cooperated very well. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"In the end, Viola's expression shifted from confusion to a smile. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After the interview, we attempted to contact the former orchestra members, but unfortunately, we found that after the orchestra disbanded, none of the members, except for Viola, had any activity in the current Cyril music scene.",

From this perspective, I might be considered the mentor of Eme-an's new members. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I compile everyone's files and have always been willing to take on this task. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Nanna, Nanna, Nanna... Whenever the children of Eme-an feel fear or confusion, the first name they instinctively call out is \"Nanna,\" which fills me with great honor. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>More fortunately, I possess the knowledge and strength necessary to fulfill this role.",
  ["8259"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"The Babel Tower will fall, will fall, it's about to fall...\" This is an ancient nursery rhyme from Obed, and no one knows why someone would curse this magnificent tower or why this simple tune has persisted through the ages. For centuries, this ominous song was dismissed as nonsense, but when Director Cosmos took office, it finally became a reality. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>As history advances inexorably, humanity is on the brink of the space age. Members of Eme-an reached a consensus early on: when humanity witnesses the full view of the planet beneath their feet, we must retreat entirely into the shadows of history, along with the Babel Tower and the Library of Babel. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Our fellow earthmen believed the ground beneath them was solid as a rock, but in reality, it is a lonely boat sailing on a fine thread over an abyss, and we hold the rudder to some extent. As the Babel Tower fades into obscurity, we must be prepared to eliminate all uncontrollable variables, maintaining the stability of the world line to the greatest extent possible. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Cosmos entrusted this task to me, likely because I have witnessed more history than anyone else in Eme-an, making me the most suitable to perform this historical surgery. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I devised a grand blueprint: systematically replace public domain information, re-edit records in public archives, subtly influence key individuals to alter their memories and relationships, and write new explanations for various relics. Eme-an meticulously filters out people and information related to the Babel Tower, striving to eliminate potential contradictions that may arise after its disappearance. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I do not see this as a deception. Whether the Babel Tower exists or not, humans interpret the universe they see according to their own wisdom. If a new narrative system can completely eliminate the concept of the Babel Tower and remain entirely self-consistent, then it becomes true history, just as non-Euclidean geometry denies the fifth postulate and gives rise to a whole new mathematical system.",

  ["8260"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Many of my friends have disappeared from my world, either missing or presumed dead. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Madman\" Tasny is a particularly special one. He left me a long time ago, but his memory remains as vivid as yesterday. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Many years ago, Tasny and his wife embarked on a journey of no return. For others, this would be seen as a solemn and glorious event, but their demeanor was more like children excited to visit an amusement park. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I never expected Tasny to return, let alone with two infants. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>When I saw him again, he looked terribly haggard. Besides the sleeping twin babies in swaddling clothes, he brought back Sally. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>He asked me to take care of his children and Sally. Tasny told me that these children, born in the library, were like floating balloons; until they had enough weight to ground themselves, I had to be the tether keeping them from drifting away. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I didn't bother trying to understand his \"mad talk.\" Experience had taught me that it was pointless to ask. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>But when I asked about his wife, Tasny shook his head frantically, his expression a mix of laughter and tears: \"She is nearing the end, nearing the end, nearing the end...\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"What do you mean by the end? Has she found\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"No, no, no, her path does not lead to our end.\" Tasny waved his hand repeatedly. \"You know there are anomalies even in the library? Anomalies within Anomalies, haha! Her end is an anomaly within an anomaly! But these two childrenthese two childrenare innocent! \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>They have inherited our blood, and they are bound to follow in our footsteps!\" he said, wiping tears from his eyes. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"If you want the children to stay away from anomalies and the Secret Alliance, I can send them back to the mortal world. I promise they will grow up healthy,\" I offered. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"You can't do that. They are miracles born in the library; their talent surpasses what you and I can comprehend.\" Tasny grinned, \"I know, I know, I know part of the library has found a new form of existence in them, just like their mother. I struggled to bring them and Sally back... Oh, you must keep this a secret from them, okay? When they set out to follow in our footsteps, they will think they are following me, but in reality, they are searching for their motherthis must also be kept secret, okay?\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Those were the last words \"Madman\" Tasny spoke to me. After that, I went on a mission, and when I returned, Tasny was no longer in the Babel Tower. No one knew where he went, and no records could trace his whereabouts.",
  ["8261"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Immortality is not a beautiful thing. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>It is more like a soft noose, a sweet poison, but one day, it will reveal its cold and deadly true nature. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I say this because I have witnessed true eternity. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>And it turned me into a small fragment of itself. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>To be honest, I don't remember much of the specifics. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I only recall a red wilderness and the moon hovering above it. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Then, the moon opened its single eye. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>My memory seems to begin there, with everything before and after dissolving into a fog of nothingness. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>It must have been some sort of anomaly. I spent a lot of effort searching through the archives of Eme-an and C.A.V.E. but found nothing. From the time of Elish to the present, there has been no record resembling it. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Such cases are not uncommon, for small-scale anomalies that only appear to a single witness. But as the years passed, another part of my memory began to surface, gradually becoming clearer. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>I remembered the eerie lunar phases that swept across the moon's surface as if it were blinking. Around that time, my body began to undergo the same cyclical changes, making me realize that I had become part of that indescribable \"eternity\", allowing me to linger in the human world for a long time. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>As those who lived in the same era as me gradually passed away, I found myself increasingly isolated in history, and the hope of uncovering the truth grew more distant. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>But I have a premonition that the one-eyed moon will one day gaze upon me again from above the wilderness, and that will be the day the noose tightens and the poison takes effect.",
  ["8262"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Enki Tasny, the 372nd Director of the Eme-an, also holds the title of the youngest director in its history.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>As the oldest secret alliance, the Eme-an has long been the core of the Control Alliance of Visionary Eidos (C.A.V.E.), with its director seen as a symbol of the hidden facets of human history and the guiding figure for all secret alliances.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Unfortunately, Enki did not live up to the image that many expected. He set the record for the shortest tenure as the head of Eme-anonly 26 days and 14 hours. Within this short period, he only performed his director duties on the first and last days; the remaining time, he delegated his responsibilities to Ninsar, Nanna, or others. In short, it seemed Enki took the position solely to enjoy the conveniences and freedoms it offered without intending to fulfill the corresponding obligations.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Even those most dissatisfied with Enki's lackadaisical approach had to grudgingly admit that he was one of the era's most outstanding geniusesthough the \"one of\" qualifier was necessary due to the presence of his equally brilliant sister, Ninsar.",
  ["8263"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>How does one become the Director of Eme-an?\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Surprisingly, this question could fill a thick tome. Despite being an organization with nearly 400 generations and thousands of years of history, there is still no clear set of rules for appointing its head. Historically, each director's election has had different reasons; some were universally accepted, while others were contentious. Generally, as an ancient collective of scholars, Eme-an tends to select the era's most distinguished scholar as its directoreven though these scholars often lack leadership qualities.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Enki is a quintessential example. He rose to the position of director because of a monograph\"The Map of the Babel Library: Manifolds, Probabilities, and Causality Arithmetics in High-Dimensional Expansions and Their Universal Representation Methods.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Of course, like Enki's other works, the title was added by the members of Eme-an who organized his extraordinary work. Enki's original title was \"How to Avoid Nanna in the Library.\" After his 140th or 150th attempt to embark on an irreversible journey only to be dragged back by Nanna, Enki resolved that to elude Nanna, he had to discover all the pathways of the library, especially those unknown to her. He did not realize that this unintentionally provided the first theoretical framework for mapping the Babel Library.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Enki's algorithm could select the most likely path to reach a destination at every fork in the road. Although it was merely a slightly more probable choice among many possibilities, it was a significant encouragement for the members of Eme-an: They believed that the accumulation of tiny probabilities would eventually turn zero into one, opening the door to a room containing \"truth.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Thus, Enki Tasny became the leader of truth-seekers.",
  ["8264"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Enki and the title of \"the best Director of Eme-an\" were worlds apart, separated by a gulf vast enough to fit a dozen Babel Towers. Instead, he earned the undisputed title of \"the most elusive Director of Eme-an.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>At the first C.A.V.E. leadership meeting after his appointment, Ninsar attended on his behalf, leading many from other secret alliances to mistakenly believe she was the new director of Eme-an. Enki's first act as director was to install \"The Foolproof Door\" in his office, a mechanism he had previously used to prevent Nanna from tracking him. As a result, during his brief tenure, most of his subordinates never had the chance to see what Enki looked like. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, \"The Foolproof Door\" did open voluntarily for one Eme-an member, marking the only time Enki personally invited someone into his office.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The invitee was Cosmos.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"My master is a genius, uninterested in understanding the thoughts of ordinary people,\" Cosmos later recalled with a helpless smile. \"But that's only because he doesn't want to think about it. If he wanted to, he could see through my little thoughts in an instant... I thought I would spend my life following him, salvaging his groundbreaking inventions before he discarded them. I never expected that this minor talent would catch his attention.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>As Cosmos described, he spent much of his career as a librarian following Enki around, uncovering the true significance of many of Enki's creationsat least, their significance from a common understanding.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>This finally caught Enki's attention. Whatever Cosmos and Enki discussed after Cosmos crossed \"The Foolproof Door\" remains unknown, but from that day on, Cosmos began to refer to Enki as \"Master\"despite being nearly 10 years older than Enki at the time.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Not long after, Enki \"vanished\" from the Babel Tower, leaving behind only a hastily written note on his desk:\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"I, Enki Tasny, the 372nd Director of Eme-an and Head Librarian of the Babel Library, hereby recommend my apprentice Cosmos as the 373rd Director and Head Librarian.\"",
  ["8265"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Enki and Ninsar's parents did not leave a significant mark in the long history of Eme-an. Aside from the surname \"Tasny,\" they left no gifts for their children. Time has passed, and most of the Tasny generation has aged. Perhaps only Nanna retains memories of knowing them. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After giving birth to Enki and Ninsar in the library, their mother entrusted their father to bring them back. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Returning from the Journey of No Return is extremely rare, as most who wish to give up midway cannot find their way out of the library again. But Tasny managed to do so. He entrusted his two children to Nanna's care before quickly returning to his endless journey. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Nanna rarely mentioned that besides Enki, Ninsar, and their father, Sally also returned from the library. According to Tasny, without Sally, they could not have left the library. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After Tasny left again, Sally provided much comfort to Enki and Ninsar. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Eventually, Enki began to feel irritated; he did not want any creature constantly making noise around him, especially one that always circled around his legs on all fours, hindering his movements. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>So, Enki began to meticulously study Sally in an unprecedented manner, trying to find a way to stop her from disturbing him, leaving behind a thick notebook. (Original title: \"Suppressing the Activity of Small Juvenile Organisms,\" retitled by the librarians as \"Sally's Observation Diary\"). \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Some excerpts from the notebook are as follows: \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Sally has millions of hairs all over her body.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"In natural light, Sally's pupil diameter ranges from 2.5-4 millimeters.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Sally is a warm-blooded animal.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Sally resists having her nails trimmed.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Sally feels safer curled up than when stretched out.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Sally feels relaxed and happy when on all fours.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Sally feels fear when away from me and Ninsar.\"",
  ["8266"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ninsar Tasny, a member of Eme-an, served as an antiquities restorer at the Babel Library, renowned for her exceptional restoration skills. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Unlike her eccentric brother, Ninsar is composed and reserved, displaying a maturity beyond her age. Most of the time, she diligently works in her workshop, methodically completing the regular restoration commissions sent by the Babel Library. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ninsar and Enki's relationship is somewhat complex. Though they are siblings, their personalities are starkly different; they often quarrel but remain inseparable. After Enki embarked on his journey into the endless rooms of the Babel Library, Ninsar followed in his footsteps with her Golem, Me, and disappeared into the library's infinite chambers.",
  ["8267"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>In the talent-laden Eme-an, most members prefer to focus their energies on exploring the countless mysteries of the Babel Library rather than fixing broken items. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>As a result, Ninsar's restoration talent was not discovered by Eme-an until she was ten years old. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The discovery happened during an accidental argument. Enki and Ninsar were debating whether the grains of sand in an hourglass were even or odd in number. In their quarrel, they accidentally knocked over the director's desk, shattering an entire row of hourglasses. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The director, who came to investigate the noise, did not scold them harshly but instead asked them to repair the broken hourglasses. Both set to work, finishing almost simultaneously, but their results were worlds apartEnki not only repaired the hourglass but also added a gravity model that could measure time, set alarms, and predict the calendar. Meanwhile, Ninsar restored the hourglass to its exact state two hours prior, down to every scratch and grain of sand, even recreating the pressure marks from before it broke. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>This incident made the director notice the extraordinary skill hidden beneath Ninsar's unique gaze. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Whether it was creating inventions out of thin air or meticulously restoring objects, both talents should not be overlooked. The next day, the director brought Ninsar to a workshop called \"Ziggurat\". <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Child, this workshop contains all the repair tools within the Babel Library. You can restore anything that interests you here. There are no rules to restrict you, feel free to use your ingenuity\". <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"However, I am curious,\" the Librarian paused, \"why did you restore the hourglass to its shattered state? Isn't that more laborious?\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Director, thank you for your kindness... but what I did wasn't really a repair. I only restored the hourglass to the state it was in 57 minutes and 15 seconds ago,\" Ninsar explained. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Because 'repair' is a very vague concept, I'm not sure what it means to 'fix' an hourglass. Does it mean allowing sand to flow through a specific shape of glass or restoring it to a specific point in time... To be honest, I don't think I'm capable of doing either.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Despite Ninsar's doubts, the director smiled and handed over the workshop to her, posting a sign that read \"Ziggurat Repair Shop Reopened\". <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The feedback from members about Ninsar's repairs was overwhelmingly positive, though there were occasional bizarre complaints: \"The model turned into a lump of iron and stone!\", \"The repaired charger works without being plugged in!\", and \"The fixed chair fell apart the moment I sat on it!\"",
  ["8268"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"So, why do you always want me to play this ancient board game? Surely, you have more important things to do, Enki.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"No particular reason. Unless, of course, you're afraid of losing to me, dear sister?\" \"... <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Roll the dice and let's begin.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ninsar rolled the dice, setting the game in motion. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"The essence of a board game lies in its simple rules, formed by mathematical models. Using probability and game theory, you can derive the optimal strategy. The game itself is almost meaningless, like playing rock-paper-scissors Don't tell me you can't see that move, Enki.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Although Ur originated in the ancient era of Obed, its rules are straightforward, much like the modern board game \"Ludo\". Players take turns rolling dice, placing pieces on the board when a specific number is rolled, and moving them to designated positions. The first player to move all their pieces to the end wins. It's a leisurely game that balances luck and strategy. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Since you know the answer, can you predict who will win this game?\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Of course not I can only deduce that my chances of winning are about fifty percent.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Exactly! The unpredictability of the outcome gives the game its meaning! The optimal strategy isn't important; no one knows the result until the game ends! So, just play with me, silly sister.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"...You have a twisted sense of fun.\" The game continued, intense and relentless. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>As the match neared its end, it was a close call, with both sides down to their last piece and victory hinging on a single roll of the dice. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>As the sound of the rolling dice faded, Lady Luck made her choice. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"How how is this possible?! How can someone roll the highest number three times in a row? This is so unfair! Even extreme outliers under the law of large numbers can't be this outrageous. What kind of luck is this!\" Ninsar exclaimed. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Luck is merely a manifestation of probability. Being surprised by this shows your foolishness.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"You say you're not surprised! When you rolled the highest number, your smile almost turned into a crescent moon!\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"If you're so dissatisfied, let's play another round.\"",
  ["8269"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Unlike Enki, who seemed to have endless inspiration, Ninsar left behind very few inventions. According to Eme-an's records, only one is notedthe stone colossus \"Mer\".\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"How do I stop Enki from embarking on the Journey of No Return?\" Ninsar pondered this question once again as she watched the hunched figure of the director. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ninsar knew that Enki was an unparalleled genius, not just of the Eme-an, but of their era. After the director stepped down, it was inevitable that her brother would inherit the position. He would disregard the expectations of others and continue to unleash his boundless curiosity, charging headlong into the Path of No Return. At that point, even Nanna wouldn't be able to stop him. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The only solution was for Ninsar herself to become the director and personally stop her brother. Thus, Ninsar declined all restoration commissions and moved into Ziggurat, using all the foresight she could muster to begin her first invention. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Stacks of fertile clay bricks lay before her. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Molds, rollers, wheels, and files... Ninsar worked day and night. The black soil of the fertile land gradually took shape, eventually resembling a human. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The humanoid Golem knelt. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>In Delphi's mythic era, there was a metal giant named Talos, with a body cast in bronze, eyes formed from gold, muscles from silver, and bones from black iron. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The dark giant remained silent. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>In a future so distant that Ninsar could barely foresee it, humans would imbue these creations with wisdom, allowing them to seek the final answers in an endless world on behalf of humanity. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>The giant, like a swaddled infant, bowed its head slightly, quietly watching the girl beneath it. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>To Ninsar, wisdom was essentially a form of statistics. As long as it answered every question posed to it, people would acknowledge its wisdom and intellect. She would provide the giant with answers, an overwhelming number of answers beyond human comprehension. \

Since then, WuShi has followed this \"Master\", becoming his personal bodyguard. WuShi does not know the true identity of this \"Master\", but due to the Emperor's teachings over the years, WuShi is utterly loyal, willing to go through fire and water for him.",
  ["8271"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>WuShi had observed the Master forging iron and steel, preparing herbal medicines, harvesting wheat and picking fruits during the busy farming season, cooking in small restaurants, tutoring children before exams, and drafting legal documents for those involved in lawsuits. In short, it seemed Master was skilled in every possible trade and excelled in all of them.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>This filled WuShi with both confusion and admiration. When he asked Master how he had acquired such extensive knowledge, The Master simply chuckled, \"To reach my level requires a lot of talent. You probably can't do it.

<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"What should I do then?\" WuShi asked.\

<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Thus, the young WuShi continued to wander the world with the Master, pondering his future.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"If you can't think of anything, you can start by being my assistant,\" Master suggested. WuShi began running errands and carrying out seemingly strange tasks. Fortunately, the miscellaneous skills he learned from Master always came in handy. Unbeknownst to him, WuShi developed a new abilityhe could blend into different identities and interact with others in various guises, much like Sir. To his surprise, WuShi found himself gradually accustomed to this life and eagerly wished to serve the Master more effectively.\

However, perhaps the most fascinating and charming aspect of fishing is that it's not entirely skill-driven. After sitting by the river all afternoon until sunset, he usually returned with only a few small fish. Since he didn't rely on fishing for food, he always released these small fish back into the water.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Every weekend, he devoted half a day to fishing by the river, consistently with little success. Still, WuShi persisted, convincing himself it was for relaxation and self-cultivation.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>One day, the float suddenly bobbed violently, and his rod bent under an unusual weight. He yanked it, and a large fish, tens of centimeters long, broke the surface.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Perhaps because it was the first big fish he had caught in a long time, he didn't react immediately. In that brief moment, several unfamiliar yet urgent voices suddenly sounded beside him.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Hey, why are you just standing there? Use the net!\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>He found himself surrounded by three or four enthusiastic fishermen, and with their instructions, all talking over one another, WuShi managed to land the fish.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Man, you've got patience! Been watching you fish here for ages!\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"This fish must weigh at least eight or nine pounds! Let me weigh it for you.\"\

<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Because you've been smiling all day!\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Is it that obvious? WuShi couldn't help but touch his face. Looking at his smiling sister, he couldn't resist telling her, \"Yesterday evening, I caught a sixty-eight-centimeter, eight-and-a-half-pound carp...\"",

<color=#FFFFFF00></color>When WuShi first set foot in Jiangyin at the age of 18, the land seemed like a paradise compared to the Western Region. With mild winds every five days and gentle rains every ten days, the vast fields were lush and full of life. WuShi was fascinated by the area. Whenever he had no tasks, he would wander around, observing the local customs and traditions.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>One evening, on his way back, WuShi passed by a farmhouse and noticed the owner had set up a small table at the entrance with an open jar on it, seemingly selling wine. The rich aroma of the wine instantly brought back memories of the distant pastthe day when his life trajectory changed.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>He approached and asked about the wine, and sure enough, it was the glutinous rice brew called \"Maiden Rose.\" The homeowners, a humble couple, had tears welling up in their eyes. \"But it's no longer called 'Maiden Rose'.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"What is it called, then?\" WuShi asked.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Withered Flower.\"\

<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"You're not from around here, are you?\" the woman said as she poured a bowl of wine for WuShi. \"Our daughter passed away last month before she came of age. Like a delicate flower bidding farewell to the tree, she left us too soon. We named the wine 'Withered Flower' because the flowers withered before they could fully bloom. According to our custom, the blessings meant for the rest of her life are left in this jar. After she left us, we sell the wine to travelers, spreading her blessings to the world.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>WuShi took the bowl of wine, feeling as if he were looking at a reflection of himself from over a decade ago. Slowly, he brought the bowl to his lips and took his first sip of the wine.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>It tasted rich and thick, with a faint, sweet fragrance.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"This is a great wine,\" WuShi said, gasping after he finished. The taste was quite strong for a first-time drinker like him. \"Can I have another bowl?\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"No,\" the woman replied with a sorrowful smile.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"You must cherish these blessings, young man. Each person is allowed only one bowl of 'Withered Flower'. More than that, and you might suffer the same fate as our daughter, unable to bear more blessings.\" \"Please pay for the wine,\" the husband said, extending his hand. \"According to our customs, the price of the wine doesn't matter. Even a single coin is fine, but you cannot drink it for free.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>WuShi emptied his pockets, pouring all his money onto the table in front of the couple.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"This this is too much!\" the husband exclaimed in shock. \"We have no intention of making a profit from this.\" \"It's alright, please accept it.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>This is... a debt long overdue,\" WuShi said, and before they could respond, he turned and left.",
  ["8274"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Azi, born into the renowned Tang family of the Western Region, hails from an ancient lineage that has persisted since the Qian Empire, spanning over a hundred years. The Tang family encompasses more than a hundred smaller families and is most famous for its expertise in hidden weapons and mechanical devices. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>As a descendant of the Tang family, Azi began learning these unique skills from a young age. Compared to her peers, Azi exhibited extraordinary talent, mastering nearly all the skills in less than ten years. According to family tradition, Azhi was expected to take on a significant role in the Tang family upon reaching adulthood, guiding future generations in preserving these ancient arts. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Unfortunately, Azi herself had no interest in this path. Instead of the family's traditional arts, she was more captivated by modern trends and fashion. Leaving behind a letter saying, \"I'm off to play in CangLin City!\", she left her hometown for the new metropolis and eventually joined WeiShi through various coincidences. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>In her daily life, Azi is always a trendsetter. Whether it's her clothing or daily habits, she consistently exudes a unique and distinctive style.",
  ["8275"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>As an ancient family from the Western Region, the Tang family boasts many long-standing traditions, with the \"Four Arts of Tang\" being one of them. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>These Four Arts\"Swallow Step\", \"Flying Dart\", \"Condensed Poison\", and \"Ingenious Mechanism\"are unique skills that the Tang family has refined over generations. According to family tradition, every member begins learning these skills from an early age. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>When Azi was just a little girl, she became a focal point for many instructors due to her study of the Four Arts. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>It wasn't because she lacked talent and needed extra help. On the contrary, Azi was quick-witted and nimble, running up and down the mansion from a young age. Whether it was running along the eaves or mastering hidden weapons, she could grasp the basics within a few days of practice. Before she was even of age, she had already mastered the first three skills. Even the \"Ingenious Mechanism\", which many adults found challenging, was something she handled with ease by the age of sixteen. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>What truly gave her tutors headaches, however, was Azi's ingenuity. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Zi Tang, how many times have I told you not to bring these strange things into the practice field!\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Teacher, this isn't something strange. Today's lesson is 'How to Escape Using Hidden Weapons', and this is the hidden weapon I prepared for the practice class.\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Are you saying flashbangs count as hidden weapons too?\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"I believe it does. According to 'Flying Dart', a hidden weapon should be 'lightweight, easy to use, and can be hidden in the sleeve; hence, it is called a dart.' When it comes to evading pursuit, this flashbang is far more effective than any needle or caltrop.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Speaking of which, 'Condensed Poison' means making poison through chemical reactions. In that case, flashbangs are also a kind of 'Condensed Poison', since they work through the chemical reaction between magnesium powder and oxidizers.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Teacher, aren't drones also 'Ingenious Mechanisms'? They're similar to the mechanical arrangements described in the books, driven by mechanical devices, just with more complex designs.\"\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"I protest, why isn't a sniper rifle considered 'Swallow Step'? No matter how skilled one is, walking will always leave traces. Isn't solving the problem from thousands of meters away without moving a step supposed to be true 'swallow passing without a trace'?\" <color=#FFFFFF00></color>At some point, Azi's understanding of the Four Arts of the Tang Family far exceeded what her tutors taught, and she regarded modern technology and tactical equipment as part of the Four Arts. <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Whenever the name of this unique student is mentioned, instructors either remain silent or show a face full of worry. Only a few younger instructors, after pondering for a while, comment with a mix of laughter and helplessness: <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Gifted\".",
  ["8276"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Even back in the Tang family, Azi was a well-known social media expert. Whether it was online shopping discounts or posting techniques, she could talk for hours about anything related to the internet. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>At that time, Azi had already set up various accounts on many platforms and forums to share her daily life. Although most of her content was about the scenery of the Shu Mountains and Tang family fun, her daily updates and lively writing style garnered her a lot of attention. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>This gradually cultivated her habit of constantly updating her social media accounts. While still at home, Azi would listen to her parents and tutors, only checking her phone and updating her status after class or meals. But after moving to CangLin City with less supervision, Azi fully unleashed herself. \
 \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Going out shopping, she updates her status. Resting at home, she updates her status. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>If the weather is sunny and she feels cheerful, she updates her status. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>If the weather is gloomy and she feels down, she updates her status to vent. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>If the weather is neither sunny nor gloomy, then she updates her status to guess whether it will be sunny or rainy later! \
 \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>From fashion trends and internet hotspots to brushing her teeth or having a snack, everything became a topic for Azi's updates. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>This habit made her particularly attentive to her follower count. Whenever she made new friends, she would invite them to follow her account immediately. When Azi joined WeiShi, she even included her social media handle in her introduction and was extremely enthusiastic during the newcomer welcome party, exchanging follows with almost all attendees. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After the party, many members of WeiShi began experiencing various strange phone-related phenomena. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Some found their phones buzzing incessantly from morning until night, with notifications of new updates waiting to be checked. Others saw their homepages flooded with promotions for seasonal perfumes, new desserts, and trendy clothes they'd never shown interest in. The most common issue was having their feeds filled with posts from a certain purple avatar account, disrupting their normal browsing experience. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Upon investigation, they all traced these issues back to the same social account: \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"wHasAziGoneToBedEarlyTodayw\". \
 \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>To this day, WeiShi has a saying: \"No matter how enthusiastic Azi gets, don't follow her account easily. If you must, make sure to enable 'Do Not Disturb' immediately.\"",
  ["8277"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Azi, do you have any money-making tips?\"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"You don't usually spend much. Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Azi continued scrolling through her phone at a leisurely pace while listening to Xin's question. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"I saw a barbecue grill last week and wanted to buy it to try out. Qing suggested I get a part-time job, but every time we go out, I see you buying perfumes and nail polishesall these expensive and fancy things. I wondered if you had any easier ways to make money.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"There are definitely many ways. For example, those perfumes and nail polishes are actually products I test for shops and promote on my social media. Not only do I get to use them for free, but they also pay me.\" \"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"But these methods are too trendy and complicated to explain in a few words. For now, just stick with your part-time job... I have something to do this afternoon. I'll teach you more when I have time.\" \
 \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>After parting ways with Xin, Azi did not head for the exit of the commercial street but walked into another shop once she confirmed that Xin wasn't following her. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>She skillfully tied her hair up, changed into her uniform, and pinned her name tag to her chest. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Welcome to Meow Meow Caf. What would you like to order?\"\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"These are our specialty drinks. You can get a 20% discount if you order two!\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Wouldn't you like to try our seasonal desserts? There's a discount if you order now!\" \
 \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Clearly, the real Azi wasn't as carefree as she appeared in front of Xin. To cover her expenses, simply relying on promotional gigs was not enough. Azi often had to work several part-time jobs simultaneously to barely make ends meet. This afternoon alone, Azi had already worked three different part-time jobs. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>As for why she didn't tell Xin the truth, it was probably just for that small bit of pride... If her friends knew about her true situation, her carefully maintained trendy image would collapse. \
 \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Oh, thank you so much, Azi! If it weren't for you, I would've been overwhelmed by my busyness! My mischievous daughter not only doesn't help with the shop but keeps spending money on all sorts of things... If only she were as obedient as you, Azi!\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Over time, Azi's frequent and outstanding work earned her a reputation as the \"jack-of-all-trades\" on the commercial street. Whenever there was a part-time job available, people would think of her first. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"By the way, Azi, there's one more thing. We have a new employee in the kitchen who is a bit impatient and is causing a mess. Could you help out?\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"No problem, I'll take care of it.\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Such rescue missions were familiar to Azi. She walked into the kitchen and immediately started organizing. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Aunt Wang has already briefed me on the situation. Since things are urgent, let's skip the introductions and get straight to work. I'll start with the preparation area in the back, and you start with the cleaning area. First, we need to...\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Huh, Azi?!\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"You already know my name? Strangely, I don't remember mentioning it... Wait, that voice is\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Following the familiar voice, Azi saw a familiar head of red hair and an equally surprised Xin. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Years later, every time she passed by that store, Azi would recall the afternoon she locked eyes with Xin, both wearing their caf uniforms.",
  ["8278"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Li Chi is the current leader of the Tianli clan and is the youngest leader in the clan's history of over a thousand years. Although he is just a teenager, he has received comprehensive education from the clan, making him knowledgeable and skilled. The only qualities he lacks as a leader are experience and patience, traits that come with age and experience. Now, Li Chi bears the heavy responsibility of guiding his clan in this new era.",
  ["8279"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Over time, many of the Tianli Clan's old rules and lifestyles have evolved into customs rather than strict laws. Despite his status as clan leader, Li Chi's daily life mirrors that of his peers. Poor academic performance leads to calls from teachers to his elders and subsequent scolding. His allowance is tightly controlled under the pretext of \"helping you develop good habits,\" and he must excel in exams to receive more. His authority is most apparent when playing games with his peers: \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"I'm the clan leader; give me the carry position!\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>In truth, Li Chi's gaming skills are as exceptional as his academic performance. Each season, the children of the Tianli Clan flock to him for help ranking up in games. \"Clan Leader, take us along!\" \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>During high-stress gaming moments, Li Chi maintains good etiquette, only typing \"?\" in the chat repeatedly instead of insulting others. This earned him the nickname \"Question Mark Clan Head\". When matched with a high-ranking player who spams question marks at the slightest issue, they automatically call him Clan Leader, hoping he will help them rank up. Consequently, the Tianli Clan unknowingly gained a prominent reputation in the gaming world under the moniker \"Question Mark Clan\".",
  ["828"]="Deploy 3 dark element characters",
  ["8280"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>According to historical accounts, Li Jun, the founding ancestor of the Tianli Clan, lived during the reign of Ji Xia, the first emperor of Qian. Renowned for his exceptional bravery and martial prowess, Li Jun mysteriously passed away shortly after the emperor established the empire. Although the cause of his death remains undocumented, various theories surround this enigma. One prominent theory suggests that Li Jun's unparalleled strength and the clan's martial dominance aroused the emperor's suspicions, ultimately leading to his assassination.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>While this theory lacks concrete evidence, one fact is certain: at some point, the Tianli Clan transitioned to a tradition where its leaders were \"Saintesses.\" To balance the clan's warrior traditions, mastery of combat ceased to be a requirement for leadership. Over time, the clan patriarch's primary duty shifted to presiding over sacred ceremonies, particularly leading the sacrificial dances performed during traditional festivals.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Trouble arose, however, when Li Chi reached adolescence. Rebellious by nature, he flatly refused to perform the sacrificial dance during the clan's traditional ceremonies, much to the frustration of the elders.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Resourceful as ever, the clan elders devised a clever solution to bring the defiant youth back in line. They explained the economic significance of the annual ceremonies: the revenue from broadcasting the events, the influx of tourists to Mount Tianque, and the jobs it created for the clan. Realizing that his refusal would jeopardize the clan's livelihood, Li Chi begrudgingly relented.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Thus, Li Chi reluctantly embraced his role, managing the clan's affairs while continuing to perform the ancestral dance during key ceremonies to ensure the clan's survival.\
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Think you can challenge the clan patriarch? Just ask him which dance he's best at, and you'll witness the full force of his skills unleashed upon you,\" is a phrase often repeated by the younger members of the Tianli Clan, blending humor with their respect for Li Chi's begrudging yet undeniable talent.",
  ["8281"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Tianque Mountain is rich in bamboo, and Li Chi learned to carve bamboo whistles at a young age. As he grew older, he also learned to play the bamboo flute. Some songs in the Tianli Clan's folk music have been accompanied by the bamboo flute since ancient times, but both the songs and sheet music are rarely shared, only performed for close friends or relatives. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>Due to this custom, Li Chi often wanders into the bamboo forest of Tianque Mountain to play the flute alone. At some point, his music began to attract a swarm of phoenix butterflies. Whenever he played under the moon, these butterflies would appear, fluttering in harmony with the melody. However, when Li Chi tried to identify these butterflies in the library, he couldn't find a matching species, and even the elders had never seen such butterflies. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>This did not trouble Li Chi, as there are countless creatures in the world. Since the butterflies enjoyed listening to his music, he was happy to have them as his audience. But as he grew older, the butterflies seemed to become more intelligent: when he was calm, their flight patterns were smooth and natural; when he was emotional, their flight became chaotic. Once, when a nosy young clan member spied on his flute practice, the butterflies flew at the intruder's face, scaring them into a hasty retreat. \
 <color=#FFFFFF00></color>If one day someone is fortunate enough to be invited by the Tianli leader to hear his flute playing, will the phoenix butterflies gently perch on their shoulders?",
  ["8282"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ji Xia, the inaugural emperor of Qian, stands as both the genesis and finale of immortality. He pioneered the unification of this expansive realm and its diverse people under one banner. Since his epoch, language and history have intertwined, flowing like an inexorable river through the ages. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>A wealth of knowledge concerning Ji Xia persists, his influence permeating every corner and epoch. As WeiShi scholars diligently pursue their studies, they unearth ever more enigmatic facets of the first emperor. Yet, they acknowledge that despite each revelation, countless untold chapters of Ji Xia's past remain entombed within the sands of time.",
  ["8283"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>No matter the era, Ji Xia has always loved drinking. The exact time he first drank alcohol is lost to history, or perhaps he witnessed the entire process of primitive malt fermentation by the ancestors. For many centuries, he never gave up this rich, flavorful drink.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>But Ji Xia could never have imagined that this small hobby would face so many setbacks in history.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The first alcohol prohibition he encountered came from his very own descendants. An early dynasty in Qian believed that the previous generation fell because the nobles and ministers indulged in drinking and neglected state affairs, so they decreed a ban on drinking without cause.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>That period caused Ji Xia much discontentment, but he soon found a workaround: he created an extensive family tree for himself, with each day being the memorial day of some ancestor, allowing him to drink under the pretext of ancestral worship. Inspired by him, his neighbors soon remembered the names of their ancestors from fifty or sixty generations ago within a few months.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>After leaving Qian and traveling west, Ji Xia encountered another prohibition in Obed. The young Emperor Daliu outlawed all taverns to improve military readiness, allowing young men to drink legally only by joining the army and earning rewards for their service. Judging by later history, this decree was very effective; however, Ji Xia left Obed and continued west, perhaps driven by Daliu's prohibition.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Unfortunately, Ji Xia's bad luck continued. When he arrived in Japh, he found the Japhetic Ethics flourishing, promoting a higher standard of living that led nobles to abstain from alcohol and prohibit their servants from drinking, even denigrating alcohol as \"the devil's drink.\" Fortunately, few people are as steadfast as a rock; Ji Xia's brewing skills, brought from Qian, soon \"persuaded\" a cardinal in Javriel. They reached an understanding: every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Ji Xia would brew and give the cardinal a pot of wine for free; every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, Ji Xia would confess his sins to the cardinal in church, and the cardinal would absolve him; on Sunday, they both rested It is said that the cardinal wrote in his meditation journal: \"Resisting excessive drinking is a battle with one's own soul. I have been defeated many times, but I will fight until the day I am summoned to another world.\" However, the most shocking prohibition for Ji Xia was the total prohibition in Polestar Conglomerate. About a century ago, Polestar banned all imports and exports of alcoholic beveRages. This continues to baffle historians: a nation of merchants banning a product with a gross profit margin of over 70% seems like a suicidal move. This decree was highly effective, raising the gross profit margin of alcohol from 70% to 700%, albeit on the black market.",
  ["8284"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>During his years with \"Master\", Wushi never seemed to see him worry about money. When they traveled, Ji Xia handed over any earnings to Wushi to manage, never inquiring about the amount or the accounts. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, Wushi was not good at managing finances, and once, in desperation, he had to inform Ji Xia that they were nearly penniless and could not even pay the rent. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Is this house rented?\" Ji Xia seemed surprised, but his response shocked Wushi even more: \"If we can't pay the rent, why not buy the house?\" \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Master, we are about to be thrown out, where would we get the money?\" Wushi smiled wryly. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"True.\" Ji Xia thought for a moment, then went to his room and rummaged through his things, finally pulling out a yellowed note from a crumpled notebook. He held it up to the light and said: \"This should be enough.\" \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Wushi recognized that the note was not written in the script of Qian but in Japheth script. He did not understand the language but recognized the faded emblem on the corner of the note, which was the mark of the Florentine Bank. \"This should be enough.\" Ji Xia tossed the note to Wushi and did not mention the matter again. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Wushi , puzzled, took the note to a branch of the Florentine Bank and handed it directly to the manager. The manager stared at the note for a long time with a look of disbelief, made a few phone calls, and finally respectfully invited Wushi into the VIP room. Soaked in sweat, the manager said: \"Sir, this deposit has accrued five centuries of interest! The cash amount is too large for us to provide immediately. Could you allow us a few days to gather the funds?\" \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Wushi was taken aback but remained composed: \"I do not need to withdraw the full amount.\" \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"How much would you like to withdraw?\" the manager asked eagerly. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"I wish to purchase a property in this city. How much would that cost?\" \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>The manager led him to the window, where he could see the bustling streets of the city center: \"Just look from here. Tell me which building you like, and I will handle the rest.\" \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Once everything was settled, Wushi returned to Ji Xia, unable to suppress his curiosity any longer: \"Master, do you have many such notes?\" \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Perhaps.\" Ji Xia replied with a faint smile, neither confirming nor denying. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Have you bought many properties before?\" \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Perhaps.\" \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"Where did you get such wealth? Have you done business, or is it an inheritance? Or-\" \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ji Xia raised a hand to stop him. Wushi quickly realized he had overstepped: \"I apologize; I shouldn't ask such questions, Master.\" \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>\"I'm not blaming you.\" Ji Xia shrugged, \"It's just that such trivial matters are hard for me to remember. Even if you ask, I can't recall.\"",
  ["8285"]="<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Ji Xia has an extensive history of imprisonment. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>From what he recalls, he has been sentenced by courts in over a dozen different countries, with total prison terms amounting to more than 1,600 years, not to mention countless fines and additional punishments such as hard labor. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>In one dynasty of Qian, the law determined guilt based on height, with those under six feet five inches exempt from punishment. Unaware of this law, while wandering, Ji Xia was caught with a group of impoverished children stealing cured hams from a butcher's shop. After being captured by the waiting shopkeeper and taken to the authorities, Ji Xia learned that since the children's heights did not meet the legal standard, all their crimes would be attributed to him. Consequently, he was sentenced to seventeen counts of theft, each carrying a nine-month prison term, totaling nearly thirteen years. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>During the early days of the Polestar Conglomerate, various regions enacted many bizarre regulations. This period marked the most intensive phase of Ji Xia's criminal record. For instance, one train station prohibited snoring while waiting for the train. Ji Xia was detained for 12 hours for snoring, causing him to miss his train. When he accidentally fell asleep and snored again while waiting for the next train, he was detained for another 40 hours for provocation. Another town required bachelors over the age of 20 to pay a bachelor management tax within two days of entering the town. Unaware of this rule, Ji Xia was fined for tax evasion. At a farm, making noise while drinking soup was forbidden; Ji Xia praised the chef's skills while drinking soup and was punished by having to wash 25 horses before being expelled. One port designated odd-numbered docks for net fishing and even-numbered docks for spearfishing, resulting in Ji Xia violating both regulations by using a fishing rod and being fined double.\
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>However, to Ji Xia, prisons were merely brief respites in his long life. With his abilities, no prison could hold him indefinitely; whenever he wanted to leave, he almost always succeeded. On one occasion, traveling from Japheth to Cyril, he encountered a group of convicts at a train station, exiled to perform hard labor in the vast eastern regions of Cyril. These impoverished people warmly shared their poor-quality moonshine with Ji Xia, so he taught them some of his \"tips\" for serving time in prison. Unfortunately, one escorting officer overheard and immediately sentenced Ji Xia for instigation to commit a crime. Hours later, Ji Xia found himself on a train bound for the desolate plains, thousands of miles away, packed in with the convicts. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Occasionally, when with Wushi, Ji Xia would recount these past stories. When Wushi asked what the longest prison sentence \"Master\" had served was for, the usually gentle Ji Xia uncharacteristically put away his smile and gave a simple answer: for taking the fall for someone else. \
<color=#FFFFFF00></color>Wushi couldn't imagine how someone of Ji Xia's ability could be forced to serve someone else's sentence, but Ji Xia quickly clarifiedhe wasn't forced; he volunteered. When Wushi tried to inquire further, Ji Xia returned to his usual relaxed demeanor: \"You're still too young. Some friends in this world are worth giving your life for, that's all.\"",

<color=#FFFFFF00></color>She seems to have a natural connection with them. Even a simple wave of her hand often draws cats and dogs to follow her home. To make her pets feel welcome, she set up a few soundproofed rooms in her house, complete with nutritious food, clean and cozy spaces, and an array of toys. In her free time, she enjoys playing with them and grooming their fur. Before long, her pets became sleek, healthy, and thriving, and her collection of animals continued to grow.\
