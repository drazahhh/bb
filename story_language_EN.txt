return {
  ["1000003_1"]="The bird, circling above, suddenly dives toward me, its sharp beak aiming straight for my forehead.",
  ["1000003_10"]="Indeed, you knew nothing about this place before you arrived.",
  ["1000003_11"]="I don't understand what you mean.",
  ["1000003_12"]="Am I just supposed to accept all of this?",
  ["1000003_13"]="Get me the hell out of this place.",
  ["1000003_14"]="I can't provide any further information until I confirm your identity.",
  ["1000003_15"]="Relax, I'll ensure your safety until the Beacon is deactivated... as long as you stay within my sight.",
  ["1000003_16"]="I need to find my other comrades. Stay close to me. It's dangerous here.",
  ["1000003_2"]="Instinctively, I shut my eyes—but instead of pain, I feel only the soft brush of feathers graze my cheek. Then, a dull thud echoes behind me.",
  ["1000003_3"]="The nameless humanoids attempting to ambush me from behind disintegrate into particles of light as the bird crashes into them. Stunned, I watch as it circles once in the void before descending toward Zero.",
  ["1000003_4"]="Come here, Ann.",
  ["1000003_5"]="As its golden wings fold in, the bird shrinks into a palm-sized finch and lands lightly on Zero's fingertips, tilting its head as it observes me.",
  ["1000003_6"]="Too many impossible things have happened in such a short time. I'm starting to grow numb to the conspicuous absurdity before me.",
  ["1000003_7"]="What happened?",
  ["1000003_8"]="Was that... an earthquake?",
  ["1000003_9"]="What are those things...?",
  ["1000004_1"]="Shamash, where are Nanna and Viola?",
  ["1000004_10"]="My body instinctively obeys and steps back.",
  ["1000004_11"]="Then, countless humanoid figures flicker out of the darkness behind him, surging toward us.",
  ["1000004_2"]="...",
  ["1000004_3"]="He gazes into the endless abyss. Zero follows his gaze and lets out a soft sigh.",
  ["1000004_4"]="The bird perched on her shoulder tilts its head curiously toward the abyss as well.",
  ["1000004_5"]="Let's hope they're not caught up in the Unknown Sector.",
  ["1000004_6"]="Shamash simply strides up to me.",
  ["1000004_7"]="Stand back.",
  ["1000004_8"]="His voice, muffled beneath the layers of bandages, carries an undeniable, commanding authority.",
  ["1000004_9"]="Don't move.",
  ["1000005_1"]="You filthy rascals...",
  ["1000005_2"]="Finally, I've found you...",
  ["1000007_1"]="Zero's call and the giant's roar have faded into the distance. &But the pain never comes. &Once steady on my feet, I open my eyes.",
  ["1000007_10"]="I am...",
  ["1000007_11"]="The silhouette utters a name, but it fails to leave even the faintest trace in my mind.",
  ["1000007_12"]="This is the \"borderland\" the Library has created for you, your sanctuary and your connection to everything.",
  ["1000007_13"]="You can come back to this place whenever you want, and through it, you can reach anywhere you desire.",
  ["1000007_14"]="However, when you return to your \"story,\" you'll forget everything that happened here.",
  ["1000007_15"]="Hold my hand.",
  ["1000007_16"]="Though I have countless questions, my throat tightens as if squeezed, and no sound escapes. I can only obediently place my hand in theirs.",
  ["1000007_17"]="I have granted you <color=#fec66b>full access within this realm</color>.",
  ["1000007_18"]="Now, I will send you away to where it all began...",
  ["1000007_19"]="Farewell.",
  ["1000007_2"]="The sight before me transcends the limits of language.",
  ["1000007_20"]="Huh?",
  ["1000007_21"]="Why am I standing here?",
  ["1000007_22"]="The last thing I remember is being grabbed by the giant and thrown out.",
  ["1000007_23"]="What happened next?",
  ["1000007_24"]="My mind went blank, as though my memories had been edited. The events in between are lost to me.",
  ["1000007_25"]="However, the collapsing world won't allow me to stay immersed in my thoughts.",
  ["1000007_26"]="The endless steel fortress made of servers is withering. The shattered iron walls scatter through the air, exceedingly gruesome, as though trampled by a vast army.",
  ["1000007_27"]="There was no one around before, but within the blink of an eye, a slender figure suddenly appears not far away.",
  ["1000007_28"]="Her long, scarlet hair flutters in the air.",
  ["1000007_29"]="In this shattered realm, only that figure stands silently, like a statue.",
  ["1000007_3"]="It is as though infinity itself has been sliced, rearranged, and reconstructed—where moments and eternity eerily stand still.",
  ["1000007_30"]="Noticing my gaze, the girl slowly turns her head toward me.",
  ["1000007_31"]="Ah, it's you, [BBNAME].",
  ["1000007_32"]="So, is this when we first met?",
  ["1000007_4"]="[BBNAME].",
  ["1000007_5"]="There you are.",
  ["1000007_6"]="I've been waiting for you...",
  ["1000007_7"]="For a long, long time.",
  ["1000007_8"]="Who are you?",
  ["1000007_9"]="Where are we?",
  ["1000010_1"]="You will pay...",
  ["1000010_2"]="For deceiving me!",
  ["100001_1"]="Chirp.",
  ["100001_10"]="Unfortunately, I can't actually do that!",
  ["100001_11"]="But hey, even if I am unable to speak, you understand what I'm trying to communicate, right?",
  ["100001_12"]="\"Words don't have to be spoken to be understood.\"",
  ["100001_13"]="You're hearing my words in your mind? Awesome!",
  ["100001_14"]="Now this cute bird's got some instructions for you! Just follow along!",
  ["100001_2"]="Chirp, chirp.",
  ["100001_3"]="Chirp, chirp...",
  ["100001_4"]="A familiar-looking bird pops out.",
  ["100001_5"]="Hey, it's me!",
  ["100001_6"]="Both Zero and I are here!",
  ["100001_7"]="Looks like you've invited us all to somewhere unexpected.",
  ["100001_8"]="Hmm? Why can I speak human language, you ask?",
  ["100001_9"]="It's only natural for a cute bird like me to speak human language, don't you think?",
  ["100002_1"]="Huh? What's this place?",
  ["100003_1"]="Oh, it's you... Looks like you brought us to quite an amazing place.",
  ["100003_2"]="No wonder ever since I first saw you... it felt like your soul was looking down at us from a very distant place.",
  ["100003_3"]="Heh, ignore my quirky words. Pretend I'm just a whisper in the wind.",
  ["100003_4"]="I'd love to explore this spot first and quietly witness the marvels you'll unveil to me next.",
  ["100003_5"]="Oh, by the way, that silly bird has something to say to you. How about indulging it for a bit?",
  ["100004_1"]="Huh? We're back here again?",
  ["100005_1"]="Time flows strangely here... Did our meeting here really happen in the order I remember?",
  ["100005_10"]="Even though we're to meet a noisy brat, let's not miss our appointment.",
  ["100005_2"]="Well, never mind. The point is... now I'm convinced this realm is crafted by the Library of Babel solely for you, detached from all time and space dimensions.",
  ["100005_3"]="You're able to go to any specific moment in time you want using this place, right?",
  ["100005_4"]="Yeah.",
  ["100005_5"]="What did you just say?",
  ["100005_6"]="Looks like you've got a clear understanding of your true essence.",
  ["100005_7"]="Heh, you've been watching us all along, but when will you realize your own terrifying self?",
  ["100005_8"]="At this very moment, what lens are you using to observe us?",
  ["100005_9"]="Alright, enough chit-chat... Come on! Use your amazing powers to take us to the next destination, will you?",
  ["100006_1"]="...Here you are.",
  ["100007_1"]="No need for questions.",
  ["100007_2"]="When you depart, all memories of this realm will fade... including those of me.",
  ["100007_3"]="That girl is quite perceptive, so this time, I've blocked her presence.",
  ["100007_4"]="Don't divulge too much to her, and don't place too much trust in her at this moment.",
  ["100007_5"]="Even if everything is predetermined, I don't want any harm to befall you.",
  ["100007_6"]="Come. Your journey awaits, filled with challenges and perils.",
  ["100007_7"]="Fear not. I'll forever protect you.",
  ["100007_8"]="I know where you're headed. It's the origin of all causal ties.",
  ["100007_9"]="I've adjusted your \"coordinates\", now you're free to embark whenever you choose.",
  ["100008_1"]="Finally, the moment has come.",
  ["100009_1"]="Don't be afraid. I've pulled you from the time's current before you crashed.",
  ["100009_2"]="As promised, I will shield you from any harm that comes your way.",
  ["100009_3"]="Don't worry about this place.",
  ["100009_4"]="This realm is \"unique\". Not even the sun's radiance can touch it.",
  ["100009_5"]="Come... I'll assist you in repairing the areas devastated by the sun.",
  ["100010_1"]="Look... Once again, this place has reconnected with the time flow outside.",
  ["100010_2"]="That was a perilous shallows where the current briefly stalled, and you have navigated through the stretch where you were most likely to run aground.",
  ["100010_3"]="Hmm?... Do you wish to revisit the \"missed\" segments?",
  ["100010_4"]="No one ever steps in the same river twice, but perhaps you're an exception.",
  ["100010_5"]="Well, take a distant view from this shore.",
  ["100010_6"]="Before plunging back into your time, feel free to glimpse what happened to others in a different time and place.",
  ["100011_1"]="...And that's it.",
  ["100011_2"]="Now, time is about to resume its march.",
  ["100011_3"]="While I can momentarily pull you from the time's current, stopping its flow is beyond my capabilities.",
  ["100011_4"]="Let's set sail. We'll meet again at the next stop... wherever that may be.",
  ["100012_1"]="Yeah, it's a shame that once we leave, neither of us will remember what has happened within this realm.",
  ["100012_2"]="It'd be great if we could both recall this pleasant chat when we meet again in reality.",
  ["100012_3"]="No, that's not true. I won't remember, but you, [BBNAME]... No, I mean, <color=#fec66b>\"You\"</color>...",
  ["100012_4"]="<color=#fec66b>\"You\" do remember, right?</color>",
  ["100012_5"]="I'm starting to understand the rules in this realm.",
  ["100012_6"]="I'm eagerly looking forward to our next meeting here... my S-e-e-r.",
  ["100013_1"]="My consciousness and memory abruptly halt at that moment.",
  ["100013_10"]="You have the ability to make the rain go back up to the sky.",
  ["100013_11"]="A familiar voice echoes in my ears, a voice that I should unmistakably recognize... but why can't I recall its owner?",
  ["100013_12"]="Are you itching to defy the rules?",
  ["100013_13"]="Whose hands could they be? Only Zero and I are in this room, but are those hands really hers?",
  ["100013_14"]="Stealthily, a pair of hands creep up to my shoulders from behind and lightly clasp around my neck.",
  ["100013_15"]="I clench my fists, sensing a fiery sensation beneath my chest.",
  ["100013_16"]="Whose hands could they be? Only Zero and I are in this room, but are those hands really hers?",
  ["100013_17"]="The falling rains will never trace their way back to the sky.",
  ["100013_19"]="The city, enveloped in a gentle rain, exudes a quiet beauty akin to a painting.",
  ["100013_2"]="The radiance fills my sight, a ripple from a bygone era emanating from its core.",
  ["100013_20"]="Verdant mountains create a distant backdrop as white clouds drift through the sky.",
  ["100013_3"]="You could even flip heaven and earth, if that's what you wished for.",
  ["100013_4"]="Grasped by those hands, it emits a golden brilliance.",
  ["100013_5"]="The Beacon of the Library is now radiating tremendous heat.",
  ["100013_6"]="At that moment, I realize the fiery sensation beneath my chest is not my imagination.",
  ["100013_7"]="The ethereal hands encircle my shoulders and clasp in front of my chest.",
  ["100013_8"]="Nothing is impossible.",
  ["100013_9"]="That's impossible.",
  ["100014_1"]="You're here... I've been waiting for you for so long... so long... so long...",
  ["100014_2"]="Even in the cave, night exists. I froze the time here before sunrise.",
  ["100014_3"]="Once you return, all will be as it was.",
  ["100014_4"]="If you still hold an interest in this tiny world, please give me your hand.",
  ["100014_5"]="Listen. Time is starting to flow again...",
  ["100014_6"]="Once you leave, go see the child. Though this static river won't leave a trace in her mind, she has indeed slumbered for far too long in this dark cave.",
  ["100014_7"]="... Huh?",
  ["100014_8"]="Sorry, I zoned out for a moment. Hmm... was that only a minute...",
  ["100014_9"]="Don't worry, I'm fine. Rather than this, have you seen today's to-do list?",
  ["100015_1"]="The Library has set up a special trial area just for you.",
  ["100015_2"]="You'll face even more trials ahead. Before you set out at each stage, it may be wise to test yourself here first.",
  ["100015_3"]="This will help you confirm whether you're truly prepared to overcome the challenges to come.",
  ["100015_4"]="When you make it through these trials, the Library will reward you with the gift of courage.",
  ["100016_1"]="Today feels unusually calm.",
  ["100016_10"]="Happy birthday.",
  ["100016_11"]="Today marks a special anniversary...",
  ["100016_12"]="Seer, I've delved into the Library archives, but there's not much information about you. However, one thing is certain...",
  ["100016_14"]="Happy birthday!",
  ["100016_2"]="However, that serenity is quickly shattered by the arrival of a familiar bird.",
  ["100016_3"]="Chirp chirp!",
  ["100016_4"]="Hey! Today you can make all the wishes you want to this generous and considerate bird!",
  ["100016_5"]="Well, the thing is... my power is limited, so let's keep this wish simple like a tasty cake!",
  ["100016_6"]="Ann.",
  ["1001000110_39"]="Farewell, outlander.",
  ["1001000110_40"]="Your journey has just begun, while mine is coming to an end.",
  ["1001000110_41"]="Keep it safe and proceed in the direction of the tower.",
  ["1001000110_42"]="Take this pendant. It's the \"key\" to the library.",
  ["1001000110_43"]="Now, the tower is yours.",
  ["1001000110_44"]="You can see it. Good, you have beautiful eyes. Trust your eyes... and know that what you're seeing is not a mirage.",
  ["1001000110_45"]="Inside that tower lies a library that holds all the answers in the world. There, you might find what you seek.",
  ["1001000110_46"]="I oversee a place... See that tower standing tall like a beacon to the heaven?",
  ["1001000110_47"]="My name is Cosmos.",
  ["1001000110_48"]="Who am I, you ask?",
  ["1001000110_49"]="A complete blank slate is the perfect starting point for everything, don't you think?",
  ["1001000110_50"]="Unfortunately, I don't have the answer to that.",
  ["1001000110_51"]="21123",
  ["1001000110_52"]="123414",
  ["1001000110_53"]="Ah, you wish to know about your past, about where you were and what you had before you arrived here in this moment.",
  ["1001000110_54"]="Allow me to ask: What do you seek in this place?",
  ["1001000110_55"]="An outsider who once basked in the sunlight but chose to descend into the depths of the caves.",
  ["1001000110_56"]="Let's see who we have here. How intriguing...",
  ["1001000110_57"]="From the Future",
  ["1001000110_58"]="Its height that forever reaches for the heavens",
  ["1001000110_59"]="We will build this tower",

  ["1001000110_67"]="Dynasties rise, and the thrones fall",
  ["1001000110_68"]="We will make this miracle grow through time",
  ["1001000110_69"]="Come",
  ["1001000110_70"]="And work together to build this grand tower",
  ["1001000110_71"]="We will seek the finest resources of all corners",
  ["1001000110_72"]="Come",
  ["1001000110_73"]="Its peak will touch the sky, so we are not scattered and divided",
  ["1001000110_74"]="In its wall, we will store knowledge lest we make the same mistakes",
  ["1001000110_75"]="We will erect a tower",
  ["1001000110_76"]="Come",
  ["100100011_1"]="From the Future",
  ["100100011_10"]="Who am I, you ask?",
  ["100100011_11"]="My name is Cosmos.",

  ["100100011_40"]="We will build this tower",
  ["100100011_5"]="Ah, you wish to know about your past, about where you were and what you had before you arrived here in this moment.",
  ["100100011_6"]="Unfortunately, I don't have the answer to that.",
  ["100100011_7"]="21123",
  ["100100011_8"]="123414",
  ["100100011_9"]="A complete blank slate is the perfect starting point for everything, don't you think?",
  ["100100013_1"]="When you fall in a dream, you jolt awake in reality.",
  ["100100013_10"]="Your sudden fall really startled us. Luckily, Zero caught you.",
  ["100100013_11"]="I've looked you over, and everything seems okay. Do you feel any discomfort?",
  ["100100013_12"]="I can't answer Nanna's question.",
  ["100100013_13"]="I carefully look around. The giant who tried to kill me and the girl who vanished in a flash of light are nowhere to be found, and the space itself has returned to a more comprehensible state.",
  ["100100013_14"]="It seems I've returned to the base of the tower once again.",
  ["100100013_15"]="What is a dream, and what is reality? The events that have occurred in such a short time have surpassed my ability to comprehend and process.",
  ["100100013_16"]="How much longer do you plan to stay in this state?",
  ["100100013_17"]="If you can move your legs, stand up.",
  ["100100013_18"]="I try to push myself up to stand, but my legs refuse to cooperate.",
  ["100100013_19"]="The little bird on Zero's shoulder shakes its head and chirps impatiently at my lack of movement, as though scolding me for not getting up right away.",
  ["100100013_2"]="I snap my eyes open, gasping for air.",
  ["100100013_20"]="Then, seeming to back up Zero's words, it takes flight and charges straight at me.",
  ["100100013_21"]="Ann...",
  ["100100013_22"]="I know you must have so many questions, but first, tell us: what just happened to you?",
  ["100100013_23"]="It's okay if you're still trying to wrap your head around it. We got caught up in this anomaly called the Library of Babel.",
  ["100100013_24"]="Just tell us what you remember in the order it happened from your point of view.",
  ["100100013_25"]="Then we'll try to answer your questions.",
  ["100100013_26"]="I rub my swollen forehead, casting a resentful glance at the culprit who left me dizzy and disoriented.",
  ["100100013_27"]="The bird seems completely unrepentant, continuing to fly erratically while chirping loudly, like an incessant noise.",
  ["100100013_28"]="Ann, quiet down.",
  ["100100013_29"]="Zero raises her hand and, in one swift and precise motion, snatches the noisy bird mid-flight, cutting off its chirps instantly.",
  ["100100013_3"]="Everything in my vision is still hazy.",
  ["100100013_30"]="I turn my gaze back to Nanna, who greets me with a warm smile.",
  ["100100013_31"]="(Recount everything I experienced after being thrown by the giant)",
  ["100100013_32"]="The words spilling from my mouth seemed like something out of a fantastical tale. Had I not lived through it myself, I wouldn't have believed it either.",
  ["100100013_33"]="To my surprise, no one shows even the slightest hint of doubt.",
  ["100100013_34"]="On the contrary, the more I speak, the heavier the atmosphere becomes.",
  ["100100013_35"]="So, you and Zero were attacked by an unknown giant within the anomaly, and you were thrown to a distant sector where you met Ereshan from the future.",
  ["100100013_36"]="That explains how you ended up falling down from the top of the tower.",
  ["100100013_37"]="Any clue about this, Zero?",
  ["100100013_38"]="No, but it doesn't matter now. I eliminated that giant, and it won't pose any further threat to us.",
  ["100100013_39"]="But we haven't figured out its true nature. That leaves me worried...",
  ["100100013_4"]="Calm down. Take a deep breath.",
  ["100100013_40"]="As I watch the two of them start discussing, I can't help but feel amazed.",
  ["100100013_41"]="Do you really believe what I'm saying?",
  ["100100013_42"]="Who is Ereshan?",
  ["100100013_43"]="What exactly are the \"anomaly\" and \"beacon\" you mentioned?",
  ["100100013_44"]="Hmm? Of course, we believe you.",
  ["100100013_45"]="After all, meeting your future self in this Library of Babel is not something impossible",
  ["100100013_46"]="Plus, we can easily verify if what you said is true.",
  ["100100013_47"]="...",
  ["100100013_48"]="The mention of the name causes Zero to furrow her brow slightly.",
  ["100100013_49"]="If what you said is true, you'll soon know who she is.",
  ["100100013_5"]="A hand rests on my chest, applying gentle, rhythmic pressure, guiding me to steady my breathing.",
  ["100100013_50"]="Well, I'm also eager to answer your questions.",
  ["100100013_51"]="But before that, we need to verify if what you said is true.",
  ["100100013_52"]="As soon as the words were spoken...",
  ["100100013_53"]="Hey, I've brought back what Cosmos asked me to get from the Philistine Sea. Can someone give me a hand with it?",
  ["100100013_54"]="I mean, seriously... Why do I have to salvage a chunk of copper sphere from the seabed? It's really weighing me down.",
  ["100100013_55"]="Huh? Who do we have here?",
  ["100100013_56"]="Oh, did I come at a bad time?",
  ["100100013_57"]="Why are you all looking at me like that?",
  ["100100013_6"]="Finally, my vision focuses.",
  ["100100013_7"]="I realize I am lying on Nanna's lap, and she is gazing at me with a look of concern.",
  ["100100013_8"]="Great, you're finally awake.",
  ["100100013_9"]="Don't worry. The Beacon is dormant, and the anomaly is gone. You're safe now.",
  ["1001001"]="Zero",
  ["1001004"]="Xin",
  ["1001008"]="Ereshan",
  ["1001010"]="Asti",
  ["100101011_1"]="From the Future",
  ["100101011_10"]="And the messages brought back by people like you are known as \"Prophecies.\"",
  ["100101011_11"]="We have constructed this tower to control and monitor the Beacon and the Library of Babel for millennia. We call ourselves Eme-an.",
  ["100101011_12"]="As time has passed, the Beacon has been activating less frequently.",
  ["100101011_13"]="I never expected it to activate on your arrival.",
  ["100101011_14"]="A clear voice interrupts me.",
  ["100101011_15"]="So, my warm welcome is the shocking news that an outlander who knows nothing is now our new director?",
  ["100101011_16"]="Ereshan stares at me.",
  ["100101011_17"]="Your story is as intriguing as your name. It's fascinating that you traveled to the future in the Library of Babel and met another me in a future timeline.",
  ["100101011_18"]="And according to my future self, you are destined to rescue us and prevent an evil conspiracy.",
  ["100101011_19"]="Well...",
  ["100101011_2"]="The Bottom of the Origin",
  ["100101011_20"]="Ereshan approaches me, her gaze is as sharp as a dagger, scrutinizing me from head to toe.",
  ["100101011_21"]="Then, as if having sensed something, she lowers her voice, and her expression changes.",
  ["100101011_22"]="You're not welcome here. Leave! Now!",
  ["100101011_23"]="The sharp difference between how she first treated me and how she acts now has left me completely confused.",
  ["100101011_24"]="Heh... don't give me that look. I was just messing with you.",
  ["100101011_25"]="Without waiting for my response, Ereshan turns to the others.",
  ["100101011_26"]="But seriously, doesn't this all sound absurd?",
  ["100101011_27"]="Some random outlander shows up out of nowhere, claiming to be Seer, and now we're dealing with a piece of scrap metal that's supposed to turn into a bomb and destroy everything.",
  ["100101011_28"]="Do you really believe that this copper sphere, lying on a seabed for who knows how long, can still be activated?",
  ["100101011_29"]="Once again, everyone's gaze fixates on the copper sphere that Shamash has brought back to the tower.",
  ["100101011_3"]="What you just experienced is called an \"anomaly.\"",
  ["100101011_30"]="Its surface is covered in greenish silt and the bone-white remains of sea animals.",
  ["100101011_31"]="Faint metallic patterns can be seen under the debris, but they appear lifeless, just like the sphere itself.",
  ["100101011_32"]="Yet, just looking at it reminds me of the horrific scene with it suspended high in the sky like the sun, dissolving everything.",
  ["100101011_33"]="My body can't help but shudder.",
  ["100101011_34"]="What exactly is this thing?",
  ["100101011_35"]="I don't know.",
  ["100101011_36"]="All Cosmos said was it's the remnants of an anomaly from Memphis. He said nothing on how it ended up buried in the Philistine Sea.",
  ["100101011_37"]="Interestingly, though, I was attacked by the <color=#fec66b>Nemesis</color> while recovering it. That means our operation was compromised.",
  ["100101011_38"]="And now, out of the blue, this unknown outlander breaks into our tower, claiming to be the rightful owner of this place",
  ["100101011_39"]="Doesn't it all seem a bit too convenient?",
  ["100101011_4"]="The anomaly originates from that black monolith. We call them \"Beacon.\"",
  ["100101011_40"]="And even if we put all that aside, that annoying old man was the one who asked me to get this sphere. Are you suggesting that our dear director wants to blow us all up?",
  ["100101011_41"]="Stop...",
  ["100101011_42"]="This is a meaningless debate based on nothing but guesswork, and it should stop now.",
  ["100101011_43"]="Zero, you and Ereshan take [BBNAME] to check the identification.",
  ["100101011_44"]="Shamash and I will take care of this copper sphere. No more questions. Just do as I say.",
  ["100101011_45"]="If this tower were to lay flat on the ground, how long would it take to walk from one end to the other?",
  ["100101011_46"]="I can't help but wonder while climbing this never-ending stairs.",
  ["100101011_47"]="The furnishings and decorations shifted and changed with every step, altering from ancient to modern, crude to refined, primitive to contemporary. As if the staircase spirals up around the central axis of history.",
  ["100101011_48"]="Rather than a lifeless construct, the tower seems more akin to an ancient tree that has stood for millennia.",
  ["100101011_49"]="Study Room",
  ["100101011_5"]="There are numerous beacons and anomalies in the world. That monolith is just one of them. The vision it creates is called the \"Library of Babel.\"",
  ["100101011_50"]="Zero walks ahead of me, her steps are smooth and steady. The eight-petaled golden flower hairpin at her ear shimmers.",
  ["100101011_51"]="Ereshan, on the other hand, trails behind me. Without turning around, I can feel her intense stare through my back.",
  ["100101011_52"]="Trapped between an icy front and scorching behind, I feel the need to break the silence and end this suffocating silence.",
  ["100101011_53"]="Where are we heading?",
  ["100101011_54"]="The top of the tower.",
  ["100101011_55"]="I need to collect your biometric data and cross-reference it with the world population database to verify your identity.",
  ["100101011_56"]="What exactly is this place?",
  ["100101011_57"]="...",
  ["100101011_58"]="Zero stops and looks back at me.",
  ["100101011_59"]="Have you ever heard the legend of the tower that reached the heavens?",
  ["100101011_6"]="To put it simply, when the Beacon is activated, the space within the tower becomes infinite, and time itself materializes separately.",
  ["100101011_60"]="I would be lying if I said \"no.\"",
  ["100101011_61"]="Humanity united to build a tower in order to reach the gods' domain.",
  ["100101011_62"]="The gods, to thwart their ambition, punished humanity by forcing them to speak different tongues.",
  ["100101011_63"]="Unable to understand one another, the humans scattered, and the tower eventually collapsed.",
  ["100101011_64"]="It seems like every civilization has similar tales to explain why there is such a huge divide between peoples.",
  ["100101011_65"]="It is a legend, and it is not.",
  ["100101011_66"]="To be precise, it became just a legend one day.",
  ["100101011_67"]="Fifty-seven years ago, Cyril launched its first satellite into space. That was the moment when mankind saw the whole world with their own eyes.",
  ["100101011_68"]="The concept of heaven was shattered, and the tower built to reach it naturally lost its purpose. At that moment, it was reduced from \"reality\" to \"legend\".",
  ["100101011_69"]="If you were an ordinary person, you would not be able to see this tower. Because it's been forgotten by the collective subconscious of humanity, any ordinary person cannot recognize its existence.",
  ["100101011_7"]="This will result in the creation of a new Library of Babel that exists outside our timeline.",
  ["100101011_70"]="Which means, you must be one of us.",
  ["100101011_71"]="What are you even talking about?",
  ["100101011_72"]="Heh...",
  ["100101011_73"]="Ereshan suddenly creeps up behind me and whispers softly into my ear.",
  ["100101011_74"]="Haven't you realized it yet?",
  ["100101011_75"]="You are now part of the legend.",
  ["100101011_76"]="Welcome to the other end of the world.",
  ["100101011_77"]="Seer.",
  ["100101011_78"]="Although her voice is so near...",
  ["100101011_79"]="It feels like it's coming from the depths of the abyss.",
  ["100101011_8"]="So theoretically, one can travel to the future within the Library of Babel. However, besides you, there is only one other person I know who has experienced it...",
  ["100101011_80"]="All of a sudden, an intense chill climbs my spine up to my skull.",
  ["100101011_81"]="My eyes widen at the familiar sensation.",
  ["100101011_82"]="Down at the bottom of the depths, the black monolith at the center once again radiates a golden light.",
  ["100101011_83"]="As soon as the ground under my feet begins to tremble, Ereshan reacts.",
  ["100101011_84"]="Tsk...",
  ["100101011_85"]="Ereshan rushes me towards Zero, shielding us with her body. In the next moment, a huge force sweeps across the sky like a hurricane, sweeping away all order.",
  ["100101011_9"]="Cosmos, the one who gave you the pendant.",
  ["100101022_1"]="Already calling that simpleton Seer, huh?",
  ["100101022_10"]="The bird nods approvingly, then cocks its tail.",
  ["100101022_11"]="Chirp... chirp chirp...",
  ["100101022_12"]="Hang on a sec, both of you.",
  ["100101022_13"]="Just stop arguing.",
  ["100101022_14"]="Looks like you're on good terms.",
  ["100101022_15"]="...",
  ["100101022_16"]="...",
  ["100101022_17"]="Let's remember our situation before you start fighting.",
  ["100101022_18"]="Your words silence both of them.",
  ["100101022_19"]="By the way, Ere, we ran into something unusual on our way here.",
  ["100101022_2"]="You are getting more vulgar. Is that a bad habit you picked up during your years outside?",
  ["100101022_20"]="Zero recounts the peculiar bookshelves we saw during our journey to Ereshan.",
  ["100101022_21"]="Ereshan just shrugs impatiently.",
  ["100101022_22"]="Is there anything in this place that isn't weird?",
  ["100101022_23"]="Instead of getting sidetracked by irrelevant stuff, perhaps we should focus on what to do next.",
  ["100101022_24"]="How long has it been?",
  ["100101022_25"]="Based on our <color=#fec66b>subjective time flow</color>, it has been two hours and twenty-five minutes.",
  ["100101022_26"]="That's surprisingly long. Didn't they say that its activation time has dropped to less than an hour over the past decade?",
  ["100101022_27"]="This time and the last time were unexpected.",
  ["100101022_28"]="So, are we just going to stand here and do nothing?",
  ["100101022_29"]="A name pops into my mind.",
  ["100101022_3"]="No one can control the activation of the Beacon. What [BBNAME] said was true, and the \"prophecy\" is true. This is enough to prove [BBNAME]'s identity.",
  ["100101022_30"]="But we still have a chance. This sphere is actually a machine that can be harnessed, and there is a <color=#fec66b>command</color> to stop it.",
  ["100101022_31"]="Find <color=#fec66b>Tasny</color>, and he'll help you discover that command.",
  ["100101022_32"]="Oh, by the way, the future you asked me to find Tasny.",
  ["100101022_33"]="Before I can finish my sentence, the air seems to grow still as both Zero and Ereshan turn their gaze toward me.",
  ["100101022_34"]="That reminds me. Looks like we don't have to stand around and wait after all.",
  ["100101022_35"]="There's one more thing we haven't verified yet.",
  ["100101022_36"]="Didn't you claim you can \"scan\" the Library? And didn't you say that the future me asked you to find Tasny?",
  ["100101022_37"]="Yeah, Ms. Parrot.",
  ["100101022_38"]="So, who's this Tasny?",
  ["100101022_39"]="Tsk... must I go through all the stories, Zero?",
  ["100101022_4"]="Or are you being stubborn for the sake of the impossible?",
  ["100101022_40"]="Tasny is the 372nd director of Eme-an.",
  ["100101022_41"]="He was the mentor of that annoying Cosmos. After passing the director's position to Cosmos, he ventured onto the Path of No Return and got lost in the Library.",
  ["100101022_42"]="And that all happened eighty years ago.",
  ["100101022_43"]="Ereshan's smile widens, yet her eyes darken.",
  ["100101022_44"]="So, if we want to see him, we have to go back eighty years.",
  ["100101022_5"]="Tsk.",
  ["100101022_6"]="This attitude... caring about absolutely nothing...",
  ["100101022_7"]="It's seriously disgusting.",
  ["100101022_8"]="I wonder what will it take to crack that icy expression of yours.",
  ["100101022_9"]="I do not understand why you are so fixated on something beyond your control?",
  ["100101031_1"]="The Path of No Return",
  ["100101031_10"]="In the center of the tower, the glyphs on the surface of the black monolith begin flashing more frequently.",
  ["100101031_11"]="As all the glyphs on the monolith light up, an eerie light fills the entire tower.",
  ["100101031_12"]="Every room in the tower begins to transform, following the scheme of many mathematical laws—duplicating, translating, folding, extending, mirroring, flipping—creating an infinite space that defies reality.",
  ["100101031_13"]="This incomprehensive process of expansion has no discernible center, or perhaps every point in space is the center. The tower becomes one colossal kaleidoscope.",
  ["100101031_14"]="Amidst all this, there is a person entirely absorbed by her work, her hands never stopping.",
  ["100101031_2"]="Approximately 5,000 years before the World Calendar, humans discovered a massive black stele within the Land of the Roaring Lion. The black monolith possessed incredible power, and the vision it brought was regarded as a divine revelation.",
  ["100101031_3"]="Numerous temples were constructed around the monolith, where the people offered their knowledge in exchange for prophecies of the future.",
  ["100101031_4"]="Many came to receive divine revelations, only to be swallowed by the monolith and become lost in the anomaly.",
  ["100101031_5"]="No one can accurately tell what the anomaly is, only describe it as an infinite hexagon.",
  ["100101031_6"]="The infinite hexagon that contains the past, the present, and the future.",
  ["100101031_7"]="It holds all the possibilities and everything unimaginable.",
  ["100101031_8"]="Its name is the Library of Babel.",
  ["100101031_9"]="25 years before the World Calendar",
  ["100101032_1"]="Ten minutes later",
  ["100101032_10"]="Enki fidgets before reluctantly handing over an object.",
  ["100101032_100"]="However, everyone desires the ultimate answer, which eventually drives them onto the Path of No Return.",
  ["100101032_101"]="In the Age of Faith, this place was seen as the library of the gods.",
  ["100101032_102"]="In the Age of Enlightenment, this place was seen as an extraordinary miracle.",
  ["100101032_103"]="In the time when the universe was described through equations, this place was seen as a mystery.",
  ["100101032_104"]="And in the time when humanity has abandoned its gaze from the heavens to see the stars, this place has become an eternal decoding machine, deciphering all knowledge in a ceaseless exhaustive search.",
  ["100101032_105"]="This infinite hexagon contains the past, the present, and the future.",
  ["100101032_106"]="It holds all the possibilities and everything unimaginable.",
  ["100101032_107"]="Yet, it offers no answers or hope.",
  ["100101032_108"]="Such is the Library of Babel.",
  ["100101032_109"]="Once the unknown is revealed, there is no turning back to ignorance.",
  ["100101032_11"]="My apology.",
  ["100101032_12"]="In Enki's hand is a brand-new chisel.",
  ["100101032_13"]="Here, I've fixed it for you.",
  ["100101032_130"]="Enki",
  ["100101032_131"]="Ninsar",
  ["100101032_132"]="Eme-an Member I",
  ["100101032_133"]="Nanna",
  ["100101032_14"]="...",
  ["100101032_15"]="Just as Ninsar is about to accept the chisel, Enki retracts his hand and starts rambling.",
  ["100101032_16"]="No, this won't do. It's too ordinary, too mundane. How could I create something so plain?!",
  ["100101032_17"]="Hold on a sec. Let me add the rifling and explosives to this chisel. Then it can help you blast through rocks and reach the working surface needed for the sculpture.",
  ["100101032_18"]="Don't worry, I'll include a control system to ensure a precise blast range, accurate to the millimeter! I know there are many parameters to consider, but I'll make it happen in just an hour!",
  ["100101032_19"]="Ninsar quickly grabs her chisel.",
  ["100101032_2"]="Hey!",
  ["100101032_20"]="No need. This one is good enough.",
  ["100101032_21"]="Hmph, you're so mean.",
  ["100101032_22"]="Enki sulks, hanging his head.",
  ["100101032_23"]="Little does he know, as Ninsar takes the chisel, a faint smile appears at the corner of her mouth.",
  ["100101032_24"]="Pausing her carving, Ninsar looks at the nearly finished sculpture in her hands.",
  ["100101032_25"]="I'll call this child \"Mer.\"",
  ["100101032_26"]="Alright... not a bad name.",
  ["100101032_27"]="Enki absentmindedly replies.",
  ["100101032_28"]="Well.",
  ["100101032_29"]="Sally has been interrupting my work lately. Can you do something to make her quiet down?",
  ["100101032_3"]="Idiot... Idiot...",
  ["100101032_30"]="A spark ignites in Enki's eyes, and his spirit once again lightens up.",
  ["100101032_31"]="Sally, eh? I'll make her a cradle, like a cat's cradle. Once she's tucked in, she'll go to sleep peacefully.",
  ["100101032_32"]="No... no, that'd be too boring! Let's see... I'll add some extra features.",
  ["100101032_33"]="How about this? I'll make a special cradle that, when you place any creature inside, it won't need to eat, drink, defecate, or lose hair. Forever in peaceful sleep.",
  ["100101032_34"]="Alright, let's go with that.",
  ["100101032_35"]="Hmm... but I don't have enough materials to make my genius idea come true...",
  ["100101032_36"]="Enki rolls his eyes once again.",
  ["100101032_37"]="Hey, Ninsar? Perhaps we could use your...",
  ["100101032_38"]="His gaze lands on a clock that Ninsar has just repaired.",
  ["100101032_39"]="No way. Don't touch what I've fixed.",
  ["100101032_4"]="Ninsar... Ninsar...",
  ["100101032_40"]="Enki's expression instantly turns sour.",
  ["100101032_41"]="I just don't get it. Aren't you bored of restoring these ancient relics day in and day out?",
  ["100101032_42"]="Even if you fix them, they're just lifeless objects that won't progress any further. So why don't you let me give them a makeover?",
  ["100101032_43"]="I don't understand either. Why do you have to make Nanna angry? Why do you always want to go deep into the Library?",
  ["100101032_44"]="If you have questions, just ask me, and I'll give you the answers. You don't need to find your answer in the Library. What are you exactly looking for in there?",
  ["100101032_45"]="Ninsar is getting riled up.",
  ["100101032_46"]="All of a sudden, Enki turns his head, locking eyes with Ninsar, and speaks with grave seriousness.",
  ["100101032_47"]="I want to know why our father embarked on the Path of No Return.",
  ["100101032_48"]="Enki's reply leaves Ninsar speechless.",
  ["100101032_49"]="Hmph...",
  ["100101032_5"]="Ninsar remains indifferent.",
  ["100101032_50"]="So how about stop acting all smart if you can't even answer such a simple question, sister.",
  ["100101032_51"]="If I can go deeper into the Library, maybe one day I'll meet our father and ask him that question myself.",
  ["100101032_52"]="You know that's not going to happen.",
  ["100101032_53"]="He left ten years ago. Even if we set out now, we'll never find the time sector he's in.",
  ["100101032_54"]="Please, Enki, don't say anything like that again.",
  ["100101032_55"]="Whether inside or outside the Library, human's short-sighted perspective will always prevent them from seeing the truth.",
  ["100101032_56"]="Don't let the Library consume you.",
  ["100101032_57"]="Office Antechamber",
  ["100101032_58"]="I've crossed off the librarians who went down the Path of No Return from the roster...... Are you doing alright, Nanna?",
  ["100101032_59"]="What do you mean?",
  ["100101032_6"]="...",
  ["100101032_60"]="I'm talking about the two kids Tasny left behind. They're the only ones who can make you look so grumpy.",
  ["100101032_61"]="I'd rather not talk about them. Let's just say they're giving me a headache.",
  ["100101032_62"]="One of them is always curious about everything, while the other doesn't seem to care about anything.",
  ["100101032_63"]="If only they could somehow balance each other out.",
  ["100101032_64"]="They did cause you a lot of trouble, it seems.",
  ["100101032_65"]="Dealing with Enki is simple. Just give him a good beating, and he'll behave... or at least pretend to. But Ninsar... well, you know...",
  ["100101032_66"]="To her, everything is transparent. After all, she has known the answers to everything since birth, so naturally, she has no expectation for anything.",
  ["100101032_67"]="Well, they were born inside the Library. Maybe it messed with their heads.",
  ["100101032_68"]="Despite their extraordinary intelligence, they're still limited by their young bodies, so their desires come across as innocent and unfiltered.",
  ["100101032_69"]="Tasny sure left you with two troublemakers.",
  ["100101032_7"]="Sister.",
  ["100101032_70"]="Well, let's forget about it for now.",
  ["100101032_71"]="What's causing me a bigger headache is our dwindling numbers. We're short-staffed.",
  ["100101032_72"]="Yeah, many of us have gone down the Path of No Return.",
  ["100101032_73"]="The Library's opening hours are getting shorter, and everyone's worried it might close permanently.",
  ["100101032_74"]="Me too, Nanna. I've applied to join the next Squad of No Return. You won't see me after the Beacon is activated again.",
  ["100101032_75"]="What did you just say?",
  ["100101032_76"]="Hey, don't give me that look, Nanna.",
  ["100101032_77"]="The Library is open only for too short of a time, so if we want to keep exploring the Unknown Sector, there's no turning back.",
  ["100101032_78"]="But what's the harm? We won't return until we reach the end of the Library. That's where we'll all end up eventually.",
  ["100101032_79"]="...",
  ["100101032_8"]="The girl finally turns her head.",
  ["100101032_80"]="I've waited for this day for far too long, Nanna. I hope you can give me your blessing before I embark on this journey.",
  ["100101032_81"]="Let's think back to the past, and think about how far we've come.",
  ["100101032_82"]="The first explorers of the Library didn't even know how to get back to reality. Thousands of Eme-ans sacrificed their lives to find the difference between the Primordial Sector and the Unknown Sector.",
  ["100101032_83"]="By studying the Unknown Sector, countless Eme-ans suspected that the Library is a comprehensive collection of all human texts, like a decoding machine...",
  ["100101032_84"]="It was only when our predecessors discovered a room full of Elish Meditations that had the exact same content but different punctuation that the hypothesis was confirmed.",
  ["100101032_85"]="Based on clues, records, and legends, our predecessors started to realize that the Library might contain things from different eras.",
  ["100101032_86"]="The extension of the Library's time, and only now have we glimpsed its vast expanse.",
  ["100101032_87"]="Until recently, some of us suggested that there is no \"separate time dimension\" within the Library, but rather time itself is an extra dimension that has always existed.",
  ["100101032_88"]="I'm genuinely curious about what else this Library holds. Nanna, I'm really curious...",
  ["100101032_89"]="What is it exactly? Does it have an end? And why does it keep creating new content? There are so many unknowns ahead, and I must embark on this journey. How can I resist?",
  ["100101032_9"]="What's wrong?",
  ["100101032_90"]="Pray for me, Nanna. If we meet again in the future, I'll be sure to have the final answers.",
  ["100101032_91"]="And when that time comes, I'll share everything I've seen and heard with you.",
  ["100101032_92"]="Nanna smiles, looking into eyes filled with pure curiosity.",
  ["100101032_93"]="I understand. May you return from the Library.",
  ["100101032_94"]="Thank you, Enheduanna.",
  ["100101032_95"]="He returns the same smile.",
  ["100101032_96"]="Although I'd prefer to meet you again on the Path of No Return.",
  ["100101032_97"]="What waits at the end of the hexagon?",
  ["100101032_98"]="For every Eme-an, that has always been the ultimate question.",
  ["100101032_99"]="No one has ever reached the end, and no one has ever returned. Therefore, the question remains unanswered.",
  ["100101041_1"]="Tasny",
  ["100101041_10"]="Sounds quite extraordinary.",
  ["100101041_11"]="You surely have your fair share of superheroes in this organization.",
  ["100101041_12"]="Yeah.",
  ["100101041_13"]="Yes, indeed. Even among all the previous directors, Tasny stands out.",
  ["100101041_14"]="...",
  ["100101041_15"]="Pfft, you've got quite a funny way of speaking.",
  ["100101041_16"]="But what exactly is this \"Path of No Return\" you've been talking about?",
  ["100101041_17"]="Ereshan and Zero kept mentioning it.",
  ["100101041_18"]="While I have a rough idea of what it means, the deeper truth behind it eludes me.",
  ["100101041_19"]="The Path of No Return is a ritual passed down among us.",
  ["100101041_2"]="Year 57 of the World Calendar",
  ["100101041_20"]="It means a one-way journey, signifying that someone is determined to never come back until they reach the end of the Library.",
  ["100101041_21"]="Ereshan can barely hide her disdain for it.",
  ["100101041_22"]="Yup, basically, those folks were tired of life and decided to off themselves, plain and simple.",
  ["100101041_23"]="Ere.",
  ["100101041_24"]="What? Is there something wrong with I said?",
  ["100101041_25"]="If you truly understand this place, you'll come to the same conclusion as I.",
  ["100101041_26"]="Zero has explained it to you, right? The Library is essentially a bizarre phenomenon that utilizes the Method of exhaustion to an extreme.",
  ["100101041_27"]="When the Library opens, it contains not only all possible combinations of text, but also all possible timelines for each sector.",
  ["100101041_28"]="Didn't you see it for yourself? Those infinite Unknown Sectors are the result of this exhaustive process.",
  ["100101041_29"]="Imagine an infinite number of monkeys typing away, and eventually, one of them will type out everything that happened in your life. The question is, how do you find that specific monkey?",
  ["100101041_3"]="Sector Boundary",
  ["100101041_30"]="It contains everything, and it contains nothing. Such is the Library of Babel.",
  ["100101041_31"]="But in the past, people had superstitious beliefs that this Library held a book of omniscience, a compilation and index of all books.",
  ["100101041_32"]="Supposedly, finding that book would give you the key to all the answers.",
  ["100101041_33"]="Has anyone ever found that book?",
  ["100101041_34"]="No.",
  ["100101041_35"]="No, that's why it's just a superstition. Nowadays, few would go down that path for such nonsense.",
  ["100101041_36"]="Once you embark on the path, you must leave at the exact same time and the exact same place you entered before the closure—missed, and you can no longer return.",
  ["100101041_37"]="With the Library opening for shorter durations, exploring the unknown regions will inevitably lead you to the Path of No Return.",
  ["100101041_38"]="You said you could \"scan\" the Library, but it seems like you're clueless about what it really means.",
  ["100101041_39"]="It means you're able to travel to any era you want and return to your current reality whenever you please.",
  ["100101041_4"]="Tasny, the director with the shortest tenure, with only one year in service. There is very little information about himself.",
  ["100101041_40"]="Ereshan comes closer to me, her gaze intensifying.",
  ["100101041_41"]="Do you understand why countless Eme-ans are so drawn to such superstition about the Library?",
  ["100101041_42"]="It's the \"unknown.\"",
  ["100101041_43"]="The fear of the unknown leads them to see the Library as a god, so much so that they're willing to sacrifice their ideals and their very lives for it.",
  ["100101041_44"]="Your claim of being able to \"scan\" the Library is, to us, blasphemy.",
  ["100101041_45"]="If our endeavors, even at the cost of our lives, mean nothing more than a walk in the park to you, then your very presence will shake the core of our foundations.",
  ["100101041_46"]="She firmly places her hands on my shoulders.",
  ["100101041_47"]="So, if you're truly Seer...",
  ["100101041_48"]="How far back in the past and future can you see? Show me.",
  ["100101041_49"]="Each word she utters hits my ears like a hammer.",
  ["100101041_5"]="Nevertheless, his inventions could fill an entire encyclopedia.",
  ["100101041_50"]="I...",
  ["100101041_51"]="Ereshan's face suddenly appears to double as she draws near.",
  ["100101041_52"]="Ere, stop it.",
  ["100101041_53"]="In my blurry vision, I see Zero trying to intervene and stop Ereshan.",
  ["100101041_54"]="And once again, I'm engulfed by a familiar sense of chaos.",
  ["100101041_55"]="It is coming again.",
  ["100101041_56"]="My vision becomes obscured as a soft whisper echoes in my ear.",
  ["100101041_57"]="Where are you going?",
  ["100101041_58"]="I understand.",
  ["100101041_59"]="Everything will go as you wish.",
  ["100101041_6"]="For example?",
  ["100101041_60"]="[BBNAME].",
  ["100101041_7"]="For example, he invented a machine capable of automatically proving or disproving any propositions.",
  ["100101041_8"]="He even created a model for the expansion and cooling of the early universe after the Big Bang.",
  ["100101041_9"]="Legend has it that he embarked on the Path of No Return to create a new language that could bridge all communication gaps.",
  ["100101042_1"]="...",
  ["100101042_10"]="Idiot.",
  ["100101042_11"]="I've been looking for you.",
  ["100101042_12"]="Why did you go on the journey alone without telling me?",
  ["100101042_13"]="Y-you... hey, you...",
  ["100101042_14"]="Alright, alright... my bad. Just don't do that. I'm sorry. It's all my fault! Don't give me that look!",
  ["100101042_15"]="Seriously, I mean it. I won't do it again.",
  ["100101042_16"]="In a panic, Enki turns his head towards us as if seeking help, trying to change the subject in a clumsy way.",
  ["100101042_17"]="By the way, who are they? Why don't you introduce me to them?",
  ["100101042_18"]="Enki breaks free from Mer's grip and trots over to us, introducing himself in rapid-fire words.",
  ["100101042_19"]="Hey there, guys! Are you Ninsar's friends? Ha, can't believe my silly sis actually made friends.",
  ["100101042_2"]="Haha... Haha... Long time no see, Ninsar...",
  ["100101042_20"]="I'm Enki, her younger brother, but that's obvious, right? Well, I mean, if that's not obvious to you, then your stupidity would go beyond the height of folly!",
  ["100101042_21"]="Your outfits... Are you also Eme-ans? But I've never seen you in the tower before. Are you newbies who joined after I left?",
  ["100101042_22"]="Wow! Then you must have heard about me from my stupid successor, Cosmos, right? Exactly!",
  ["100101042_23"]="He clears his throat and raises his head proudly.",
  ["100101042_24"]="I am his mentor, the 372nd director of Eme-an, and the greatest genius this tower has ever known, beyond the reach of all. That is, I am...",
  ["100101042_25"]="Enki Tasny!",
  ["100101042_3"]="The boy avoids making eye contact with Ninsar, scratches his head, and glances away, trying to cover up his guilt with a careless tone.",
  ["100101042_4"]="Obviously, his attempt backfires as Ninsar's anger intensifies.",
  ["100101042_5"]="...",
  ["100101042_6"]="You are such an...",
  ["100101042_7"]="She raises her hand high.",
  ["100101042_8"]="S-sis...?",
  ["100101042_9"]="At the last moment, instead of landing with force, her hand loses its momentum and gently touches Enki's face.",
  ["100101043_1"]="Eighty Years Ago",
  ["100101043_10"]="What's going on here?",
  ["100101043_11"]="Everything looks different now.",
  ["100101043_12"]="...",
  ["100101043_13"]="Report in, Zero.",
  ["100101043_2"]="23 years before the World Calendar",
  ["100101043_3"]="Sector Boundary",
  ["100101043_4"]="As my vision clears again, the scenery around me has subtly changed.",
  ["100101043_5"]="Zero and Ereshan, standing beside me, exchange solemn glances.",
  ["100101043_6"]="...",
  ["100101043_7"]="...",
  ["100101043_8"]="...",
  ["100101043_9"]="Hey...",
  ["100101051_1"]="The Height of Folly",
  ["100101051_10"]="This is the password for the Tower of Babel's core server, along with the key to the first original archive of historical documents. And here, the highest-authority password for the C.A.V.E. central database...",
  ["100101051_100"]="Sooner or later, the rationality of this world will reach a point where it won't tolerate anomalies or us.",
  ["100101051_101"]="At that time, we'll quietly step off the stage for the sake of our compatriots still living in the cave.",
  ["100101051_102"]="No need to be sad about it. It's an inevitable process, an unstoppable tide.",
  ["100101051_103"]="Sleep, Ninsar, my sweet girl...",
  ["100101051_104"]="Ninsar closes her eyes at Nanna's gentle, lullaby-like words.",
  ["100101051_105"]="She is not sure if she is shedding tears due to excessive drowsiness.",
  ["100101051_106"]="But she did indeed feel a drop of liquid sliding down the corner of her eyes.",
  ["100101051_107"]="My poor, sweet girl... Sleep now... sleep in peace...",
  ["100101051_108"]="Director's Office",
  ["100101051_109"]="What are you doing, Enki?",
  ["100101051_11"]="Are you even listening, Director? The C.A.V.E. leaders have been notified about the change in Eme-an's leadership, and they're planning a remote meeting this afternoon.",
  ["100101051_110"]="Nanna enters the room and sees a small figure working on a large clock.",
  ["100101051_111"]="Ninsar complained to me about Sally always bothering her, so I'm making a cradle.",
  ["100101051_112"]="This will help Sally fall asleep.",
  ["100101051_113"]="Don't treat Sally like she's some annoying cat. And wait, you're turning Ninsar's clock into a cradle? Isn't that hers?",
  ["100101051_114"]="But Sally is an annoying cat! She's always following us around.",
  ["100101051_115"]="Fine.",
  ["100101051_116"]="Nanna resigns herself, knowing she shouldn't dig deeper into this topic.",
  ["100101051_117"]="Let's talk about something else. I just spoke with Ninsar, Enki. You shouldn't have made your sister so sad like that.",
  ["100101051_118"]="Enki shakes his head with certainty.",
  ["100101051_119"]="She wasn't sad at all, silly Nanna. It was all an act. She doesn't get sad.",
  ["100101051_12"]="Put it off.",
  ["100101051_120"]="Fine, whatever you say. Actually, I didn't come to talk about your sister either.",
  ["100101051_121"]="Nanna's expression and tone become serious.",
  ["100101051_122"]="You're well-prepared, aren't you?",
  ["100101051_123"]="Enki freezes for a moment, then looks back at Nanna with grave seriousness.",
  ["100101051_124"]="I am.",
  ["100101051_125"]="Are you here to stop me, Enheduanna? Just so you know, even if it's you, I won't back down this time.",
  ["100101051_126"]="Of course not.",
  ["100101051_127"]="When your father, Tass Tasny, brought you back from the Library, I had a feeling this day would come.",
  ["100101051_128"]="You're pretty much like him and even more like your mother.",
  ["100101051_129"]="The term \"mother,\" which Nanna has never spoken before, piques Enki's curiosity.",
  ["100101051_13"]="Huh?",
  ["100101051_130"]="Our mother?",
  ["100101051_131"]="Yeah, your mother.",
  ["100101051_132"]="Nanna's face takes on a nostalgic look.",
  ["100101051_133"]="Your mom was even more daring than your dad. She gave birth to you while exploring the Library, and after entrusting you to Tass, she continued her journey without hesitation.",
  ["100101051_134"]="If it weren't for Tass's conscience, you might have ended up as \"nutrients\" for the Library, I'm afraid.",
  ["100101051_135"]="Hearing this, Enki's eyes slowly widen in surprise, as if his reflexes are delayed for the first time in his life.",
  ["100101051_136"]="That's a shame. Such a shame! Why would he go back for an independent life that only inherited half of his genetic information?",
  ["100101051_137"]="Your reaction is truly... unusual.",
  ["100101051_138"]="But yeah, that's what makes you their child.",
  ["100101051_139"]="It's love, Enki. The answer is love.",
  ["100101051_14"]="Or better yet, you can attend in my place. I didn't become the director just to listen to those blabbering idiots.",
  ["100101051_140"]="His love for you overcame his faith, and his desire to ensure your survival surpassed his longing for the path ahead.",
  ["100101051_141"]="Enki blinks, revealing his truest thoughts to Nanna.",
  ["100101051_142"]="I don't get what you're saying. Are you talking about the brain's release of phenylethylamine, oxytocin, or dopamine?",
  ["100101051_143"]="Nanna smiles and shakes her head.",
  ["100101051_144"]="No, none of those.",
  ["100101051_145"]="Remember this, Enki. No matter what, you and Ninsar are human beings.",
  ["100101051_146"]="Only by understanding the vulnerability of being human can you appreciate the significance of strength, and only by knowing the brevity of life can you see the splendor of eternity.",
  ["100101051_147"]="Once you understand what I'm talking about, you'll truly become an adult instead of a kid driven purely by curiosity.",
  ["100101051_148"]="Enki takes a step back.",
  ["100101051_149"]="I don't like that look you are giving me, like I'm an idiot.",
  ["100101051_15"]="Enki.",
  ["100101051_150"]="Well, you are.",
  ["100101051_151"]="Nanna leans down and ruffles Enki's hair, despite his resistance.",
  ["100101051_152"]="You know what? You've been calling others \"idiots\" this whole time, but you've never realized your own foolishness. Who's the real silly one here?",
  ["100101051_153"]="Hey, I'm not silly.",
  ["100101051_154"]="Alright, alright, you're not.",
  ["100101051_155"]="Her eyes, filled with love and compassion, carry a hint of sadness.",
  ["100101051_156"]="I've seen your determination to explore the Library. Now, all I can give you is my blessing for the adventure that lies ahead.",
  ["100101051_157"]="Enheduanna...",
  ["100101051_158"]="So... go, Enki.",
  ["100101051_159"]="Good luck to you.",
  ["100101051_16"]="Nanna's voice turns cold.",
  ["100101051_17"]="We are Eme-an, the mouthpieces of the gods. We are obliged to listen to the prayers of the travelers from all directions and solve their problems. This has been the teaching of the Eme-an since it was founded.",
  ["100101051_18"]="You are now our director, our spokesperson. You must take your responsibility seriously. It's not something you can just say \"no\" to.",
  ["100101051_19"]="I...",
  ["100101051_2"]="24 years before the World Calendar",
  ["100101051_20"]="At that moment, someone gently tugs on the corner of Nanna's clothes.",
  ["100101051_21"]="Ninsar?",
  ["100101051_22"]="I'll go attend the meeting, Nanna.",
  ["100101051_23"]="But...",
  ["100101051_24"]="It's fine. I'm a Tasny, too.",
  ["100101051_25"]="The office door opens again, and heavy footsteps enter the room",
  ["100101051_26"]="Enki doesn't even need to look up to know it is Ninsar.",
  ["100101051_27"]="Back from the meeting with that bunch of morons? Anything interesting?",
  ["100101051_28"]="Well, forget about those idiots. I'm about to optimize the Foolproof Door to version 8.0. Come and see what other questions I can add here...",
  ["100101051_29"]="Ninsar jumps down from the statue's arms and walks over to Enki, crouching down beside him.",
  ["100101051_3"]="Director's Office",
  ["100101051_30"]="Nothing special happened this year. All the other Beacons, except the black monolith at the Tower of Babel, have stayed quiet.",
  ["100101051_31"]="I knew it. Nanna's just so stuck in her ways, to put it politely. She said she listens to the prayers of travelers from all directions, when in fact, she just wants to check for any anomaly and keep tabs on everyone around the world.",
  ["100101051_32"]="Obviously, we all know that anomalies have occurred maybe once every decade, if that, over the past century. Seriously, they should just disband this so-called C.A.V.E.",
  ["100101051_33"]="When was the last time we heard anything about Nemesis? They've been gone for years. If you ask me, they're smarter for bailing early after seeing the writing on the wall.",
  ["100101051_34"]="But something interesting is going on between Polestar and Cyril.",
  ["100101051_35"]="What is so interesting about countries' politics? They can do whatever for all l care. It's always about famine, plague, and war.",
  ["100101051_36"]="Same old boring stuff over and over again, unoriginal and incredibly stupid",
  ["100101051_37"]="Just as Enki is about to babble on, Ninsar's words silence him.",
  ["100101051_38"]="They're having a contest about the \"same old boring stuff.\"",
  ["100101051_39"]="What kind of contest?",
  ["100101051_4"]="This is your office, Director. According to the rules, I'm supposed to give you a brief introduction...",
  ["100101051_40"]="They're seeing who can break the speed limit of 7.9 kilometers per second first.",
  ["100101051_41"]="Ninsar keeps her gaze fixed on Enki's face, watching for any reaction.",
  ["100101051_42"]="So, who will win?",
  ["100101051_43"]="Cyril.",
  ["100101051_44"]="How much longer till they do it?",
  ["100101051_45"]="Twenty-four years from now.",
  ["100101051_46"]="Enki's hands pause, and he turns his attention inward.",
  ["100101051_47"]="Hmm, I guess I'll have to pick up my pace.",
  ["100101051_48"]="Pick up your pace for what?",
  ["100101051_49"]="...",
  ["100101051_5"]="Skip the introduction. Just give me the key to the file cabinet behind the mural and the key to the safe in the hidden compartment in the floor. Oh, and the code to the gate in the hidden compartment behind the large bookshelf.",
  ["100101051_50"]="Enki pretends not to hear and continues working.",
  ["100101051_51"]="Answer my question, Enki.",
  ["100101051_52"]="Enki raises his head abruptly, meeting Ninsar's eyes.",
  ["100101051_53"]="For the Foolproof Door Version 8.0, of course!",
  ["100101051_54"]="Once it's done, no one will be able to disturb me anymore! This time, I'll add 1,000 questions so those dimwits won't be able to finish the game within their lifetime!",
  ["100101051_55"]="...",
  ["100101051_56"]="Ninsar remains silent, simply staring back at him.",
  ["100101051_57"]="Their gazes intertwine, piercing through each other's mind as their faces are reflected in each other's eyes.",
  ["100101051_58"]="Why did you become the director of Eme-an, Enki?",
  ["100101051_59"]="The boy lets out an exaggerated cry but slightly averts his eyes.",
  ["100101051_6"]="Ah, forget it. I'll crack it myself.",
  ["100101051_60"]="Whoa! Is the sun going out?! Can't believe you're actually asking someone a question.",
  ["100101051_61"]="I know the answer, but I want to hear it straight from you.",
  ["100101051_62"]="...",
  ["100101051_63"]="Well, I guess I'll have to give you a serious answer, silly sis.",
  ["100101051_64"]="The boy heaves a heavy sigh.",
  ["100101051_65"]="Because the director possesses the highest authority, not bound by any rules.",
  ["100101051_66"]="Nobody can stop me from doing what I'm about to do, not even you or Nanna.",
  ["100101051_67"]="When the Beacon is activated next time, Ninsar, I'm going into the Library... searching for its end.",
  ["100101051_68"]="Enki extends his hand towards Ninsar, excitement brimming on his face.",
  ["100101051_69"]="Finally, my journey will begin. Be happy for me, sis.",
  ["100101051_7"]="How many times have you sneaked in before?",
  ["100101051_70"]="This is a declaration without room for debate.",
  ["100101051_71"]="Ninsar does not take his hand.",
  ["100101051_72"]="She bites her lip, turns around, and walks away without looking back.",
  ["100101051_73"]="Enki is left alone in the library, watching his sister leave.",
  ["100101051_74"]="Entrance Corridor",
  ["100101051_75"]="What's wrong, Ninsar?",
  ["100101051_76"]="Why are you sitting here alone, looking so down?",
  ["100101051_77"]="Ninsar panics and touches Nanna's face.",
  ["100101051_78"]="Pfft, stop it.",
  ["100101051_79"]="Both you and Enki are smart yet so childish. It's moments like these when I realize you guys are still just kids.",
  ["100101051_8"]="Besides the times you caught me? Hmm, I don't remember, but who cares? This place is mine now! Got anything else to report? If not, just leave me alone.",
  ["100101051_80"]="Remember, I've watched you both grow up. I can tell when something's up, even if you're trying to hide it.",
  ["100101051_81"]="Nanna walks over to Ninsar and slowly sits down.",
  ["100101051_82"]="Nanna...",
  ["100101051_83"]="I'm here.",
  ["100101051_84"]="Ninsar nestles into Nanna's arms.",
  ["100101051_85"]="Ninsar nestles into Nanna's arms.",
  ["100101051_86"]="Nanna, Nanna... Nanna... Enheduanna...",
  ["100101051_87"]="I'm here.",
  ["100101051_88"]="Enki is about to leave, isn't he?",
  ["100101051_89"]="Yeah.",
  ["100101051_9"]="His words give Nanna a headache.",
  ["100101051_90"]="Yeah, recent events seem to have made him anxious.",
  ["100101051_91"]="Ninsar looks up, her calm tone carrying a plea beneath it.",
  ["100101051_92"]="Nanna, can we shoot down those artificial satellites made by Polestar and Cyril?",
  ["100101051_93"]="Nanna gives her an incredibly warm smile.",
  ["100101051_94"]="Well, if you asked me to destroy the moon, I'd be tempted to give it a shot.",
  ["100101051_95"]="Unfortunately, we can't, Ninsar. We can't interfere with those processes.",
  ["100101051_96"]="She caresses Ninsar's head.",
  ["100101051_97"]="Just like we can't stop Geocentric theory from being proposed and Heliocentric theory from being discovered.",
  ["100101051_98"]="We couldn't stop humanity from discovering that the Earth is round or stop gravity from making that apple fall.",
  ["100101051_99"]="Likewise, we can't prevent the discovery of the gravitational constant or the launch of the first artificial satellite into the sky.",
  ["100101061_1"]="Subjects of the Sun",
  ["100101061_10"]="My full name is Ninsar Tasny, and the Director Tasny you mentioned is my younger brother.",
  ["100101061_100"]="I'm feeling conflicted now.",
  ["100101061_101"]="Good, now I've learned new, useless facts.",
  ["100101061_102"]="...",
  ["100101061_103"]="...",
  ["100101061_104"]="Enki, they're here in this era because they need something from you.",
  ["100101061_105"]="Oh, right. You guys are here for that copper sphere, right?",
  ["100101061_106"]="Got any specifics on it?",
  ["100101061_107"]="Yes, it is here.",
  ["100101061_108"]="Awesome, let me take a look.",
  ["100101061_109"]="Enki examines it, then presses his arms against his sides, declaring energetically:",
  ["100101061_11"]="Why didn't tell us earlier?",
  ["100101061_110"]="Nope! Never seen it before! I have no idea what it is!",
  ["100101061_111"]="Tsk, I knew we shouldn't expect much from this cocky runt.",
  ["100101061_112"]="Oh, I see. So you not only admire your grandpa, but also have respect for me. Looks like your grandpa taught you well.",
  ["100101061_113"]="Admire? Respect? Taught me well? Who are you talking about, you little... Hmhmhmhm...",
  ["100101061_114"]="Please just ignore her, Master Enki.",
  ["100101061_115"]="It's all right. Do you recognize this, Ninsar?",
  ["100101061_116"]="Ninsar looks at the picture.",
  ["100101061_117"]="You are the source of life. You fell from the heavens to the Memphis River. Your descent was meant for us and stirred ripples throughout the valley...",
  ["100101061_118"]="At dawn, you rise in the sky. You exalt the day. You give nourishment to humanity, just as you give them life.",
  ["100101061_119"]="Spare us your mumbo jumbo prayers.",
  ["100101061_12"]="Because you didn't ask.",
  ["100101061_120"]="I'm translating the text on this sphere.",
  ["100101061_121"]="Ninsar gives us a sidelong glance.",
  ["100101061_122"]="It's a hymn, an ancient ode from Memphis praising the sun.",
  ["100101061_123"]="More specifically, it's a hymn written by the eighteenth monarch of Memphis, Akhenaten, in praise of Aten, the God of the Sun.",
  ["100101061_124"]="If I'm correct, this copper sphere you recovered from the Philistine Sea...",
  ["100101061_125"]="It's the God of the Sun for Ancient Memphis.",
  ["100101061_126"]="Yeah, now that you mention it, I start to understand why it looks a bit like the Star Simulator I made earlier.",
  ["100101061_127"]="I see, I see. So basically, this stuff is a... magnetically confined fusion reactor!",
  ["100101061_128"]="Why is it not called a \"tokamak\"?",
  ["100101061_129"]="The God of the Sun is a magnetically confined fusion reactor?",
  ["100101061_13"]="I don't give out answers unless I'm asked.",
  ["100101061_130"]="Huh? Tokamak? What is that?",
  ["100101061_131"]="At that moment, Enki's curious expression intensifies, as though he is about to spring at me.",
  ["100101061_132"]="But Ninsar holds him down.",
  ["100101061_133"]="Just as we suspected, Ere.",
  ["100101061_134"]="I had a feeling it might be something like that, but I didn't think it would be an actual nuclear explosion. No wonder it obliterates everything.",
  ["100101061_135"]="Nuclear explosion?",
  ["100101061_136"]="Why are you so surprised? Even the real sun is just a massive fusion reactor.",
  ["100101061_137"]="But why did it appear in an ancient time like that?",
  ["100101061_138"]="Because of the Beacons! The Beacons, of course! They're all anomalies created by Beacons, and there's more than one Beacon in this world.",
  ["100101061_139"]="I wouldn't be surprised if one of them happened to fall in ancient Memphis.",
  ["100101061_14"]="Huh? What's up with all the silence? Why did everyone suddenly get so quiet?",
  ["100101061_140"]="So, the so-called God of the Sun...",
  ["100101061_141"]="It's just wishful thinking by those in ancient Memphis.",
  ["100101061_142"]="It's not really a god, at least not in the grand universal sense.",
  ["100101061_143"]="The idea of \"god\" originally came from ignorance.",
  ["100101061_144"]="Ancient people did not understand the unknown and could not control it, hence they revered it as \"gods.\"",
  ["100101061_145"]="It has nothing to do with rituals, worship, sacrifices, fear, obedience, or faith. It is just a collective term for things beyond human knowledge.",
  ["100101061_146"]="And any phenomenon caused by these \"things beyond human knowledge\" is called an \"anomaly.\"",
  ["100101061_147"]="Any highly advanced technology might seem like magic at first.",
  ["100101061_148"]="But once you unveil the mystery, you'll realize that it's just boring stuff.",
  ["100101061_149"]="Pfft, but come to think of it...",
  ["100101061_15"]="Zero looks calm, her face devoid of all emotion, as cold as an ice sculpture.",
  ["100101061_150"]="For early humans, the sun was a celestial body that brought life to everything.",
  ["100101061_151"]="For present humans, the sun is a star that constantly produces nuclear fusion inside.",
  ["100101061_152"]="Worshipping the sun for humans is like worshipping farming and production.",
  ["100101061_153"]="So, if one can harness the power of nuclear fusion, they essentially harness the sun itself.",
  ["100101061_154"]="Even if we keep calling this copper sphere the God of the Sun, it's not entirely wrong.",
  ["100101061_155"]="I think you're overcomplicating things.",
  ["100101061_156"]="Let me simplify it for you: Imagine you throw a light bulb into an ant nest, and the ants start worshipping it as if it's a god or something.",
  ["100101061_157"]="Now, imagine that copper sphere as something left on Earth by some powerful alien, then discovered by a bunch of monkeys who end up worshipping it like a god.",
  ["100101061_158"]="...",
  ["100101061_159"]="...",
  ["100101061_16"]="She just keeps her eyes tightly shut, not wanting to comment on this revelation.",
  ["100101061_160"]="...",
  ["100101061_161"]="Well, that's one way to look at it.",
  ["100101061_162"]="Ninsar interrupts the scientific explanations, going in different directions.",
  ["100101061_163"]="Anyway, if there's a command that can control the copper sphere, it probably wouldn't be in the language of Memphis or any human language.",
  ["100101061_164"]="It is obvious that this sphere was created by someone else. Let's call them \"gods\" for now.",
  ["100101061_165"]="Naturally, those creators use the language of the gods, or a language completely alien to human understanding, to command their creations.",
  ["100101061_166"]="Interesting. Now that's interesting.",
  ["100101061_167"]="A Vulgar Language Even Fools Can Understand, ahem, I mean, the Complete Language... I didn't complete it when I ventured down the Path of No Return.",
  ["100101061_168"]="Now, if there is a language that commands gods, then I should definitely include it in the Complete Language.",
  ["100101061_169"]="Even gods should be able to understand the Complete Language!",
  ["100101061_17"]="As for Ereshan, she is clearly wavering inside.",
  ["100101061_170"]="While I continue my journey, I'll help you study the sphere and this so-called language of gods to figure out the command you're looking for.",
  ["100101061_171"]="How long do you think it will take, Master Enki?",
  ["100101061_172"]="Three years should be enough.",
  ["100101061_173"]="Since you can travel through time, meet me in this sector three years from now.",
  ["100101061_174"]="Enki stares at me with eager anticipation.",
  ["100101061_175"]="I'm looking forward to it. Let's see what surprises you will bring.",
  ["100101061_18"]="No way. That old man's mentor is a brat... He's a brat...",
  ["100101061_19"]="Enki puts a hand on his hip, pointing at Ereshan with obvious dissatisfaction.",
  ["100101061_2"]="23 years before the World Calendar",
  ["100101061_20"]="Hey, who do you think you're talking to?",
  ["100101061_21"]="Cosmos respects me very much. Although he's a mediocrity, he's my apprentice. I can't just let your rude words slide.",
  ["100101061_22"]="She is Cosmos' granddaughter.",
  ["100101061_23"]="Oh, I get it. That makes sense now.",
  ["100101061_24"]="You get what?",
  ["100101061_25"]="I'm not seeing the connection here.",
  ["100101061_26"]="What makes sense now?",
  ["100101061_27"]="It's pretty much like when I'm always calling Enheduanna an idiot. She's trying to show affection to me, right?",
  ["100101061_28"]="Enheduanna?",
  ["100101061_29"]="Before I can ask who Enheduanna is, Ereshan abruptly raises her voice.",
  ["100101061_3"]="Director's Office",
  ["100101061_30"]="Who are you saying is trying to show affection to you? You bra— Zero... (Don't cover my mouth!)",
  ["100101061_31"]="Zero covers Ereshan's mouth.",
  ["100101061_32"]="Sorry about her misbehavior.",
  ["100101061_33"]="Hmm, looks like you're really getting along well. Just like us, right, Ninsar?",
  ["100101061_34"]="...",
  ["100101061_35"]="Ninsar glances at Zero and Ereshan, who is trying to say something, and stays silent.",
  ["100101061_36"]="But then again, who exactly are you guys?",
  ["100101061_37"]="Let me explain.",
  ["100101061_38"]="I see, so you've come from eighty years in the future.",
  ["100101061_39"]="But what catches his attention is not the copper sphere, or the prophecy, or the impending doom of the Library.",
  ["100101061_4"]="I am his mentor, the 372nd director of Eme-an, and the greatest genius this tower has ever known, beyond the reach of all. That is, I am...",
  ["100101061_40"]="Enki walks around me with unbridled interest, like a curious child surveying a new toy he has never seen before.",
  ["100101061_41"]="This is fascinating! I never expected someone could actually travel through different sectors within the Library. I've gained new insights about this place.",
  ["100101061_42"]="Can I touch you?",
  ["100101061_43"]="I prefer to keep an appropriate distance...",
  ["100101061_44"]="What are you up to?",
  ["100101061_45"]="I'll pass on that...",
  ["100101061_46"]="Without waiting for my response, Enki moves closer.",
  ["100101061_47"]="Hmm, your skull looks normal, no hidden organs, or extra ears or eyes. How do you perceive the abnormal passage of time? Or maybe you don't actively perceive it?",
  ["100101061_48"]="Enki traces the back of my neck and down my spine, then gives my ribs a firm squeeze.",
  ["100101061_49"]="Seven cervical vertebrae, twelve thoracic vertebrae, and twenty-four ribs. Your bone structure is just like that of an ordinary human. So, what makes you so special?",
  ["100101061_5"]="Enki Tasny!",
  ["100101061_50"]="I don't feel any implants or augmentations under your skin, and based on the echoes, your heart and lungs seem pretty normal, too.",
  ["100101061_51"]="Well, let's examine your lower back, tailbone, and pelvis...",
  ["100101061_52"]="Zero steps forward and stops Enki's hand.",
  ["100101061_53"]="Master Enki, please be gentle with our Seer.",
  ["100101061_54"]="Chirp chirp chirp!",
  ["100101061_55"]="Enki's eyes light up again when he sees Anchirp on Zero's shoulder.",
  ["100101061_56"]="Well, then can I study this plump chicken on your shoulder?",
  ["100101061_57"]="How fascinating! A bird that possesses human intelligence and can transform into pure energy. What exactly are you?",
  ["100101061_58"]="Chirp!",
  ["100101061_59"]="Anchirp gets startled, feathers standing on end, and then disappears from sight.",
  ["100101061_6"]="The energetic self-introduction is met with an eerie silence from everyone.",
  ["100101061_60"]="Looks like it won't be showing itself to Enki for a while.",
  ["100101061_61"]="After a brief commotion, Enki reluctantly stops, but his curious gaze lingers.",
  ["100101061_62"]="Can you show me your ability? I mean, the ability to travel through different time sectors?",
  ["100101061_63"]="Then he immediately shakes his head.",
  ["100101061_64"]="Oh, forget it. Never mind.",
  ["100101061_65"]="It feels like cheating if you can just go anywhere you want. It's dull.",
  ["100101061_66"]="I want to savor the novelty of this Library fully! I'd rather take the long route than a shortcut.",
  ["100101061_67"]="Are you... really the former director?",
  ["100101061_68"]="So, this is the style of the former director?",
  ["100101061_69"]="Seriously, something is wrong with you.",
  ["100101061_7"]="Ah.",
  ["100101061_70"]="What are you talking about? Are you thinking I'm a fake or something?",
  ["100101061_71"]="No, I'm just a bit surprised...",
  ["100101061_72"]="No, but I heard...",
  ["100101061_73"]="I recount what I heard from Zero about Enki's remarkable achievements. Now, it is difficult to reconcile those extraordinary creations with the kid in front of me.",
  ["100101061_74"]="Enki's face mirrors my own surprise.",
  ["100101061_75"]="The Truth Verifier? The Singularity Explosion Model? And the Complete Language? What the heck? I never made any of those!",
  ["100101061_76"]="Master Enki, the librarians gave them different names from what you originally called them.",
  ["100101061_77"]="The Truth Verifier is actually the Multi-Button Self-Regulating Rhythmic Hypnotizer.",
  ["100101061_78"]="Ah, now I get it! That's a remarkable device. You throw a proposition at it, and it just keeps clattering away all night. Perfect for curing insomnia!",
  ["100101061_79"]="But those idiots thought it was a waste to have it by my bedside, so they forced me to hand it over.",
  ["100101061_8"]="Ninsar turns her head.",
  ["100101061_80"]="But before I did, I gave it one final task: \"There are no propositions in the world that this machine can't prove.\" If they want to hear it clatter, they can listen to it all they want!",
  ["100101061_81"]="So, how's it going after eighty years? Is it still clattering away?",
  ["100101061_82"]="As you expected, the Truth Verifier still operates to this day, ceaselessly outputting the proof process. We simply cannot repurpose it.",
  ["100101061_83"]="Hahahahaha! I see! So, what about the Singularity Explosion Model you mentioned?",
  ["100101061_84"]="That is actually your personal cookbook called \"Singularity Popcorn.\"",
  ["100101061_85"]="Oh, right! But I thought it was a complete failure.",
  ["100101061_86"]="I was trying to calculate the exact space-time coordinates where the shockwave of a singularity explosion would decay just enough to turn corn kernels into popcorn.",
  ["100101061_87"]="But the next singularity cycle would take too long for the recipe to come to fruition in my lifetime.",
  ["100101061_88"]="So I chucked that cookbook into the shredder. Wait, did they retrieve it?",
  ["100101061_89"]="Exactly. The librarians retrieved that invaluable book from the shredder.",
  ["100101061_9"]="Oh, I forgot to mention.",
  ["100101061_90"]="Seriously, I just don't understand what those idiots are thinking.",
  ["100101061_91"]="And what about this Complete Language? Which one of my genius creations did they misunderstand this time?",
  ["100101061_92"]="That is a brand new language you invented to eliminate all communication barriers between humans.",
  ["100101061_93"]="Every word in it is as precise as math.",
  ["100101061_94"]="Oh, so you're calling it the Complete Language? Hmm, that's a way better name than what I had in mind.",
  ["100101061_95"]="I was going to call it \"A Vulgar Language Even Fools Can Understand.\"",
  ["100101061_96"]="Those idiots speaking different languages keep annoying me every day. So, to solve the problem once and for all, I dedicated myself to unifying all the swear words in Cyril, Japheth, Obed, Qian, and others into a single language.",
  ["100101061_97"]="All I need to do is unleash a string of curses in that language, and anyone, anywhere in the world will perfectly understand what I mean: \"I'm busy, so stop bothering me and get lost!\"",
  ["100101061_98"]="And the best part? It retains the emotional essence of the original obscenities!",
  ["100101061_99"]="...",
  ["100101062_1"]="Reunion with Enki",
  ["100101062_10"]="Light bulb?",
  ["100101062_11"]="Are you talking about Aten?",
  ["100101062_12"]="Huh? Aren't we talking about the copper sphere you showed me earlier? Aren't you looking for a way to turn it off?",
  ["100101062_13"]="Well, I managed to decipher the language of its creator.",
  ["100101062_14"]="Enki stops talking and looks at me with obvious pride, as if to say, \"Impressed yet?\"",
  ["100101062_15"]="This is truly amazing! You're really a genius!",
  ["100101062_16"]="Wow, you did it! I expected no less from a previous director!",
  ["100101062_17"]="...",
  ["100101062_18"]="You can be quite flexible sometimes. You're starting to impress me.",
  ["100101062_19"]="Enki seems genuinely satisfied with my compliment.",
  ["100101062_2"]="Conference Hall",
  ["100101062_20"]="It was a piece of cake, really. But honestly, when I found the answer, I was a bit disappointed. As I thought, those ancient people were just stupid. The language they revered as \"divine\" turned out to be so simple...",
  ["100101062_21"]="Well, let me start from the beginning. Thousands of years ago, there was another Beacon in Memphis, and it created an anomaly that enveloped the entire city of Ehtaton, turning it into perpetual night.",
  ["100101062_22"]="The only source of light in Ehtaton was a metallic sphere that emitted light and heat nonstop, just like the sun.",
  ["100101062_23"]="Amenhotep, the eighteenth monarch of Memphis, honored it as the God of the Sun.",
  ["100101062_24"]="He named it Aten and changed his own name to Akhenaten, which means \"the soul of Aten.\"",
  ["100101062_25"]="The so-called language of the gods recorded in the ancient Memphis documents can be easily understood by any math professor in our time and even more so in your time. If you've been to school, you should understand its true nature.",
  ["100101062_26"]="In the Memphian language, Aten is referred to as \"Jtn,\" where \"J\" stands for \"0\" and \"tn\" stands for \"1.\"",
  ["100101062_27"]="In their literature, all prayers related to Aten consist of only these two syllables.",
  ["100101062_28"]="Seriously, it's getting tiresome explaining something as simple as a language with two elements. What's it called again?",
  ["100101062_29"]="Binary, of course.",
  ["100101062_3"]="Hey there, fools from three years ago!",
  ["100101062_30"]="Could you please explain it in details, ingenious Master Enki?",
  ["100101062_31"]="Precisely!",
  ["100101062_32"]="Somehow, I have a feeling that even if I have figured out the answer, I shouldn't steal the spotlight from him.",
  ["100101062_33"]="Oh, you still don't get it?",
  ["100101062_34"]="As I expected, Enki's pride is almost overflowing.",
  ["100101062_35"]="The language of the god...",
  ["100101062_36"]="It's binary!",
  ["100101062_37"]="It's funny how millions of people worshipped the God of the Sun, trying to please it with their prayers.",
  ["100101062_38"]="But in reality, the \"god\" was waiting for them to give it commands. It responded not because it was happy, but because they happened to stumble upon the correct code.",
  ["100101062_39"]="I've delved into your era over the past three years. Of course, mostly with information provided by Ninsar.",
  ["100101062_4"]="Since you've made it here, you must have found the instructions I left behind, right? Did you collect all five documents?",
  ["100101062_40"]="It makes me laugh whenever I think about Akhenaten's capital city. It must have been like a keyboard, with each prayer being a key.",
  ["100101062_41"]="Countless people spent decades typing away, finally stumbling upon a few valid commands, which they carefully transcribed and preserved as oracles...",
  ["100101062_42"]="They could have commanded the sun to rise, yet they knelt to pray to it. Is there anything more stupid than that?",
  ["100101062_43"]="And to think that the prayers from thousands of years ago eventually became the cornerstone of human civilization. That's the greatest joke ever!",
  ["100101062_44"]="Tragically, Pharaoh Ehtaton accidentally stumbled upon the last command, which turned out to be the self-destruction command for that copper sphere.",
  ["100101062_45"]="So, yeah, Ehtaton got completely wiped out by the god's anger. That's the whole story of Ehtaton and Aten.",
  ["100101062_46"]="I thought it'd take me three years to uncover the secrets of this \"language of the gods.\" Turns out, it took me only three days... no, at most three hours!",
  ["100101062_47"]="So, how are we supposed to stop it?",
  ["100101062_48"]="How can we prevent it from self-destructing?",
  ["100101062_49"]="Enki's face scrunches up in a sour expression.",
  ["100101062_5"]="Sure thing. We've got them right here.",
  ["100101062_50"]="About that, uh, well... you know...",
  ["100101062_51"]="Let's not dwell on that for now.",
  ["100101062_52"]="Ereshan shoots Enki a piercing look.",
  ["100101062_53"]="Don't try to change the subject, you little brat!",
  ["100101062_54"]="Zero glances around.",
  ["100101062_55"]="Speaking of which, Master Enki, where is Lady Ninsar?",
  ["100101062_56"]="Oh, right... Since I've given you so much information, it's time for a little favor in return.",
  ["100101062_57"]="You've got to help me before I tell you the divine command to stop the sphere. Fair deal, right?",
  ["100101062_58"]="Sure, what favor?",
  ["100101062_59"]="I see, being the director of Eme-an means you get to be cheeky.",
  ["100101062_6"]="Well, not quite...",
  ["100101062_60"]="That's the attitude.",
  ["100101062_61"]="What are you talking about? Aren't you a director, too?",
  ["100101062_62"]="Actually, not long after we parted ways with you, I had an argument with Ninsar, and that's why I'm hiding out here.",
  ["100101062_63"]="She's probably furious with me right now.",
  ["100101062_64"]="What did you do?",
  ["100101062_65"]="Well, I didn't really do anything...",
  ["100101062_66"]="Here's the deal: Ninsar has a grumpy cat.",
  ["100101062_67"]="So, I made a cat's cradle to keep it from bothering Ninsar ever again.",
  ["100101062_68"]="Once you place the cat inside, it won't need to eat, drink, or defecate, and it won't shed hair. It'll just sleeps peacefully all the time...",
  ["100101062_69"]="Are you trying to put the cat in eternal slumber or something?",
  ["100101062_7"]="Not bad. Even fools can gain wisdom through learning.",
  ["100101062_70"]="Are you talking about a perpetual hibernation pod?!",
  ["100101062_71"]="Why are you talking such nonsense, too?! It's a cradle! A cradle! Just a regular old cradle to make the cat sleep peacefully!",
  ["100101062_72"]="Huh? What are you even talking about? It's just a cat cradle, the most ordinary kind.",
  ["100101062_73"]="And what happened then, Master Enki?",
  ["100101062_74"]="Making a questionable device wouldn't make your sister that mad, right?",
  ["100101062_75"]="Enki averts his gaze.",
  ["100101062_76"]="Well, the thing is... I made that cradle using a clock she had restored.",
  ["100101062_77"]="Come on, it's not that big a deal, right? Why would she be so angry?",
  ["100101062_78"]="...",
  ["100101062_79"]="...",
  ["100101062_8"]="No big deal if you haven't found them all. Not everyone is a genius like me, after all.",
  ["100101062_80"]="...",
  ["100101062_81"]="Master Enki.",
  ["100101062_82"]="With all due respect...",
  ["100101062_83"]="You really brought this upon yourself.",
  ["100101062_84"]="Pfft.",
  ["100101062_85"]="I-is it really that bad?",
  ["100101062_86"]="Hey, you! Is it seriously that bad?",
  ["100101062_87"]="I... I'm not sure...",
  ["100101062_88"]="(Pretend not to hear his words.)",
  ["100101062_89"]="Gahh...",
  ["100101062_9"]="Well, in any case, I gathered a lot of documents from the Memphian era and studied the light bulb thrown into the ant nest.",
  ["100101062_90"]="She was furious when she found out. She even tried to stuff me in that cradle...",
  ["100101062_91"]="I managed to run away and ended up completely separated from her.",
  ["100101062_92"]="Anyway, please help me out! I have no clue how to calm her down this time!",
  ["100101071_1"]="The Mountain of Gods",
  ["100101071_10"]="Knowing the answer to everything, she is haunted by the feeling of infinite emptiness.",
  ["100101071_11"]="1111111111111111",
  ["100101071_12"]="The splendor of this world was reached billions of years ago in an instant, a mere fraction of time. Everything existing today is but the aftermath of that explosion, a fading solace.",
  ["100101071_13"]="As far as she can see, humans would exhaust their lifespans in their futile attempt at reaching the Gate of Truth. No matter how much they struggle, the outcome won't change.",
  ["100101071_14"]="She does not expect too much from something with a fleeting existence that will soon fade away.",
  ["100101071_15"]="Do you know the answer to the Library, Ninsar?",
  ["100101071_16"]="...",
  ["100101071_17"]="I believe I've answered that question many times.",
  ["100101071_18"]="Enki giggles.",
  ["100101071_19"]="I keep asking this because not even you know the answer.",
  ["100101071_2"]="I can't remember which philosopher said this, but...",
  ["100101071_20"]="You're being mean.",
  ["100101071_21"]="Ninsar sighs as she looks at the black monolith.",
  ["100101071_22"]="It holds the final questions that not even she can answer.",
  ["100101071_23"]="Where did it come from?",
  ["100101071_24"]="Who created it?",
  ["100101071_25"]="Why is it standing here?",
  ["100101071_26"]="Why did it bring the anomaly into the world?",
  ["100101071_27"]="The sky and the earth remain silent on these questions.",
  ["100101071_28"]="Anomaly, what an exquisite name. A medium of divine revelation, a phenomenon beyond the laws of nature.",
  ["100101071_29"]="Ninsar feels that way.",
  ["100101071_3"]="Only the ignorant can marvel at the wonders of creations.",
  ["100101071_30"]="Perhaps the first human on this planet gained wisdom not by staring up at the stars, but by gazing at this black monolith.",
  ["100101071_31"]="It is not a miracle: it is a god in itself.",
  ["100101071_32"]="The transformation of matter and energy within the Library occurs without any loss, and even entropy can be freely reversed.",
  ["100101071_33"]="All the \"answers\" Ninsar knows do not apply to that place. It is another universe with vastly different logic.",
  ["100101071_34"]="Is that universe also attempting to answer these questions in the most brutal way, the Method of exhaustion?",
  ["100101071_35"]="She does not know the answer.",
  ["100101071_36"]="All she knows is that humans, who can't even reach the Gate of Truth in their own world, will never reach the end of the Library.",
  ["100101071_37"]="Their exploration is futile, utterly worthless... a pointless journey destined to yield no answers.",
  ["100101071_38"]="But why? Why are there still people who embark on the Path of No Return?",
  ["100101071_39"]="I want to know why our father embarked on the Path of No Return.",
  ["100101071_4"]="But what of the omniscient?",
  ["100101071_40"]="Ninsar stayed silent when Enki posed that question.",
  ["100101071_41"]="It wasn't that she didn't know the answer, but rather, the answer was all too obvious.",
  ["100101071_42"]="Therefore, it wasn't a question, but rather an answer that Enki gave to her.",
  ["100101071_43"]="It is a yearning for knowledge.",
  ["100101071_44"]="The desire for knowledge is the innate instinct of all intelligent beings, and none can escape its dominance.",
  ["100101071_45"]="In that sense, the Library is more like an insatiable beast.",
  ["100101071_46"]="With its infinite possibilities, it has been enticing all truth-seekers to march forward and ultimately become its sustenance.",
  ["100101071_47"]="What exactly does it want to devour?",
  ["100101071_48"]="Everything... anything is acceptable...",
  ["100101071_49"]="Ninsar mutters to herself.",
  ["100101071_5"]="Will they never be able to experience the indescribable splendor of the world?",
  ["100101071_50"]="Just don't take Enki away from me.",
  ["100101071_51"]="Hmm, I guess I'll have to pick up my pace.",
  ["100101071_52"]="Pick up your pace for what?",
  ["100101071_53"]="She knows she shouldn't have asked that question.",
  ["100101071_54"]="She already knew the answer deep down, but she still wants to hear it for herself, even if it would only end up distressing her.",
  ["100101071_55"]="Only in these moments does she truly recognize the human flaws that still reside within her.",
  ["100101071_56"]="Anomalies are existence abandoned by the world, or more precisely, something forgotten by the \"world known to mankind.\"",
  ["100101071_57"]="As humanity's knowledge of the universe grows greater and more perfect, irrational things will be forgotten.",
  ["100101071_58"]="With the passage of time, the Beacon has been activated less and less frequently, and many anomalies have become myths and legends.",
  ["100101071_59"]="She has seen the future.",
  ["100101071_6"]="Perhaps due to being born in the anomaly known as the Library of Babel, she is gifted with eyes that see through all things in the world.",
  ["100101071_60"]="The rockets manufactured by the Republic of Cyril have already surpassed the escape velocity, and in two more years, Polestar will achieve the same.",
  ["100101071_61"]="The first man-made satellite is about to break through the atmosphere, and the age of astronautics is approaching. Near-Earth orbit will soon become as crowded as a highway.",
  ["100101071_62"]="When sunlight within the vacuum is reflected in the camera, myths and the eras associated with them will fade away forever.",
  ["100101071_63"]="Yggdrasil will wither, and the Nine Realms will collapse.",
  ["100101071_64"]="The giant elephants and tortoises that carry the Earth will die, and the sun will no longer be carried by boats or carriages.",
  ["100101071_65"]="The shape of the world will henceforth remain a sphere, eternally.",
  ["100101071_66"]="As the unknown becomes known, humanity retains only one way to explain the universe, and the rest will become legends.",
  ["100101071_67"]="The Library will soon be completely closed. The world of increasing entropy shall never tolerate its existence.",
  ["100101071_68"]="The unknown land will forever remain unknown. The mountain where the gods reside will no longer allow anyone to climb it.",
  ["100101071_69"]="Wouldn't this be an urgent call, for the child aspired to climb the mountain of gods?",
  ["100101071_7"]="From the moment of her birth, she has seen through all the \"answers\" of this world.",
  ["100101071_70"]="How truly tragic is this countdown for one as such?",
  ["100101071_71"]="Every time Ninsar woke up in the middle of the night, she would instinctively reach out to touch the space beside her on the bed.",
  ["100101071_72"]="But one day...",
  ["100101071_73"]="When she opened her eyes and realized that the scrawny figure was no longer on the pillow next to her...",
  ["100101071_74"]="When the tower was no longer filled with his laughter...",
  ["100101071_75"]="She knew that the fateful day had finally come.",
  ["100101071_76"]="And she, too, had to depart.",
  ["100101071_77"]="Towards the unknown.",
  ["100101071_78"]="So, you're the successors from the future.",
  ["100101071_79"]="With just one glance, she saw through those travelers.",
  ["100101071_8"]="To her, this world is transparent, holding neither unknowns nor surprises.",
  ["100101071_80"]="So, visitors from another sector... What are you seeking?",
  ["100101071_81"]="She knew the answer to her journey when she saw their confused look upon hearing her and Enki's names.",
  ["100101071_82"]="The Library's prophecies are absolute. This realm is independent from the human timeline, and there is no beginning or end to this space. Everything that has happened happens in the past, present, and future at the same time.",
  ["100101071_83"]="Neither she nor Enki managed to come back.",
  ["100101071_84"]="Such was their fate.",
  ["100101071_85"]="However...",
  ["100101071_86"]="Looking at the modified clock beside her, a thought suddenly sprouts in her mind and grows frantically.",
  ["100101071_87"]="Her brother, a genius with a touch of foolishness, always invents something beyond one's wildest imaginations.",
  ["100101071_88"]="Even when he intended to make a cat cradle, he ended up inventing a miraculous machine that could put people into a state of permanent hibernation.",
  ["100101071_89"]="Any living being that stays inside will reach a state of complete dormancy.",
  ["100101071_9"]="Those born on the summit can never truly understand the joy of an adventure as they ascend the peak.",
  ["100101071_90"]="Not only will they fall into a deep sleep, but even their cellular metabolic processes will come to a complete standstill.",
  ["100101071_91"]="While Enki is a difficult child, if she can somehow lock him into the cradle, she will be able to take him with her on the journey.",
  ["100101071_92"]="Even if one day she collapsed on the journey, perhaps in the distant future, a seeker will find Enki in the cradle and take him away.",
  ["100101071_93"]="Furthermore, if that person happens to be Seer that Cosmos found, and if they possess the ability to travel through time...",
  ["100101071_94"]="She might even be able to ask that person to return to this sector in the future and awaken Enki.",
  ["100101071_95"]="This will allow Enki to travel to the future.",
  ["100101071_96"]="In this way, Enki will have a second chance. A chance to start his journey anew.",
  ["100101071_97"]="A chance to escape this doomed fate without any answers.",
  ["100101081_1"]="Cradle of Peaceful Rest",
  ["100101081_2"]="Anyway, please help me! I have no idea how I'm going to calm her down this time!",
  ["100101081_3"]="He uttered those words.",
  ["100101081_4"]="Zero and Ereshan's gazes simultaneously grow serious.",
  ["100101081_5"]="Ereshan draws out her scythe, while Zero immediately picks me up in her arms and jumps away.",
  ["100101081_6"]="In the next moment, a huge clock breaks through the wall like a wild horse, crashing through the place where we were standing and slamming into Enki, who is still dumbfounded.",
  ["100101081_7"]="Whoaaaaa! Why is it coming again?!",
  ["100101081_8"]="Ere!",
  ["100101081_9"]="Tsk, I've got this!",
  ["100101082_1"]="Conference Hall",
  ["100101082_10"]="Enki's face instantly lights up with joy.",
  ["100101082_100"]="May we meet again in the future.",
  ["100101082_101"]="The clock falls down, its hands flying and gears scattered all over the place.",
  ["100101082_11"]="Huh? Oh, that's a great name!",
  ["100101082_12"]="Is that what you should care about?!",
  ["100101082_13"]="He drops his head again.",
  ["100101082_14"]="Well, the point is, such an awesome name will never get used.",
  ["100101082_15"]="I don't think you should focus on that either.",
  ["100101082_16"]="I wink at Enki, signaling him to look further away.",
  ["100101082_17"]="Not far away, Ninsar is standing with Mer, watching the farce come to an end.",
  ["100101082_18"]="...",
  ["100101082_19"]="...",
  ["100101082_20"]="Enki walks up.",
  ["100101082_21"]="I'm sorry for tampering with your clock. I'm really sorry.",
  ["100101082_22"]="Just don't be mad at me, sis.",
  ["100101082_23"]="...",
  ["100101082_24"]="Ninsar feels regret, looking at the wreckage of the clock scattered on the ground.",
  ["100101082_25"]="It is like this accident blocks the last way back, and she doesn't know if she should feel sad or happy.",
  ["100101082_26"]="In the end, she just lets out a long sigh.",
  ["100101082_27"]="Ah, never mind.",
  ["100101082_28"]="Seeing Ninsar's expression, Enki starts acting cocky.",
  ["100101082_29"]="How about I make another one for you?",
  ["100101082_3"]="Ereshan, who has just dismantled the clock with her bare hands, is gasping.",
  ["100101082_30"]="Haven't you learned your lesson yet?",
  ["100101082_31"]="Alright, just forget what I said.",
  ["100101082_32"]="Enki then looks at us.",
  ["100101082_33"]="Well, thanks for helping me find Ninsar. But then again, you didn't really help me at all. Feels like it's not a good deal for me...",
  ["100101082_34"]="Cut the crap, you little brat. If it wasn't for me, you would've been stuffed into the coffin by that intelligent weapon you made.",
  ["100101082_35"]="Just hand over the command to stop that copper sphere from blowing itself up.",
  ["100101082_36"]="Hmm...",
  ["100101082_37"]="Master Enki.",
  ["100101082_38"]="Keeping promises is a virtue.",
  ["100101082_39"]="Ninsar seems to have grasped the situation.",
  ["100101082_4"]="How ridiculous! Who in their right mind would add so many weapons to this so-called cat cradle?",
  ["100101082_40"]="I see. It seems my silly brother bragged to you about something he hasn't actually figured out.",
  ["100101082_41"]="It's true that he figured out the grammar of the language of the gods without too much effort, but knowing the grammar and knowing the specific words are two different things.",
  ["100101082_42"]="For the past three years, Enki has been trying relentlessly to decipher the command to stop Aten from self-destructing.",
  ["100101082_43"]="Unfortunately, there are very few examples left in the ancient Memphis text, and he didn't have enough material for semantic and logical analysis. That's why the progress has been slow.",
  ["100101082_44"]="Oh, yeah! That's what happened...",
  ["100101082_45"]="There should be a complete list of Aten's commands in this Library. No, I mean, there has to be!",
  ["100101082_46"]="But heck, how am I supposed to find that list in this mountain of books? Finding a particular leaf in a forest might be easier!",
  ["100101082_47"]="Or maybe just give me more samples of Aten's commands! If you want me to find the answer, you should at least tell me the full riddle, right?",
  ["100101082_48"]="But what's left from the era of Memphis is either mutilated or too vague.",
  ["100101082_49"]="He is completely giving up.",
  ["100101082_5"]="Enki trots up to the clock and stomps his feet in frustration.",
  ["100101082_50"]="In short, I don't know how to stop Aten from blowing itself up.",
  ["100101082_51"]="Then why did you boss us around?!",
  ["100101082_52"]="I can't believe someone can be so shameless...",
  ["100101082_53"]="Enki's face turns red with embarrassment.",
  ["100101082_54"]="However.",
  ["100101082_55"]="I do have some information.",
  ["100101082_56"]="Besides destroying Ehtaton, that copper sphere has shown up twice in history.",
  ["100101082_57"]="One of them was two thousand years ago.",
  ["100101082_58"]="Two thousand years ago...",
  ["100101082_59"]="Zero looks thoughtful.",
  ["100101082_6"]="Ah! No, no, no... Why did you smash my cat cradle? I-it's a gift I made for Ninsar...",
  ["100101082_60"]="Back then, Obed was under the rule of the fifth emperor of the Arsacid Empire.",
  ["100101082_61"]="Exactly.",
  ["100101082_62"]="Actually, Aten was taken in by Eme-an at that time before it got lost for some unknown reason.",
  ["100101082_63"]="Two thousand years ago. That was the last time Aten shone in history.",
  ["100101082_64"]="Perhaps you should go back and ask the people of that era. Maybe they can give you more valuable information.",
  ["100101082_65"]="Thank you.",
  ["100101082_66"]="The sister is definitely more reliable.",
  ["100101082_67"]="You're welcome.",
  ["100101082_68"]="By the way, since you seem to have a deep understanding of antiquities, Master Ninsar...",
  ["100101082_69"]="Zero suddenly steps forward and takes out something, handing it to Ninsar.",
  ["100101082_7"]="But why did you... Ahhhh... This invention took me so much time! And you just... Ahhhh...",
  ["100101082_70"]="I spare a glance and realize that it is an armor fragment from that unidentified giant.",
  ["100101082_71"]="Do you know anything about this?",
  ["100101082_72"]="Ninsar barely glances at it before coming to a conclusion.",
  ["100101082_73"]="This belongs to Darius.",
  ["100101082_74"]="Looks like you got caught up in some unexpected incidents before arriving here.",
  ["100101082_75"]="Zero thoughtfully puts away the fragment and purses her lips.",
  ["100101082_76"]="Oh, wait. Wait...",
  ["100101082_77"]="Enki suddenly remembers something and starts gesturing dramatically.",
  ["100101082_78"]="What is it this time?",
  ["100101082_79"]="Do you have something else to share, brilliant Master Enki?",
  ["100101082_8"]="Let's stop calling it the cat's cradle. Let's call it...",
  ["100101082_80"]="I just remembered something.",
  ["100101082_81"]="Wait, are you being sarcastic?",
  ["100101082_82"]="Ah, forget it...",
  ["100101082_83"]="I just remembered something.",
  ["100101082_84"]="Enki looks at Ereshan.",
  ["100101082_85"]="Er... Ere... Well, Cosmos' granddaughter.",
  ["100101082_86"]="Enki continues before Ereshan lashes out.",
  ["100101082_87"]="So, it was you from the future who asked [BBNAME] to come to me and get the command to stop Aten, right?",
  ["100101082_88"]="Ereshan freezes at his words.",
  ["100101082_89"]="Indeed, if what [BBNAME] said is true.",
  ["100101082_9"]="Let's call it The Resting Bell.",
  ["100101082_90"]="Oops, now this is bad. Really bad.",
  ["100101082_91"]="What's wrong with Aten's divine words?",
  ["100101082_92"]="Haven't you realized it yet? I wouldn't have bothered investigating Aten's divine words if it weren't for your arrival. You sparked my interest in this field.",
  ["100101082_93"]="If I hadn't met you, how would I know anything about Aten's divine words? Why would I have studied such a thing?",
  ["100101082_94"]="A shiver runs down my spine as I realize the implications of his words.",
  ["100101082_95"]="However, Ninsar remains calm, her amber eyes seemingly having seen through everything long ago.",
  ["100101082_96"]="Enki, on the other hand, waves his hand innocently.",
  ["100101082_97"]="Be careful. The prophecy may actualize itself.",
  ["100101082_98"]="Well, that's all the help we can provide.",
  ["100101082_99"]="Farewell, my unexpected friends.",
  ["100101091_1"]="Departure",
  ["100101091_10"]="I already examined [BBNAME], and based on biological characteristics alone, there's no doubt Seer is as human as us.",
  ["100101091_100"]="As long as they hold each other's hands, they will reach their destination...",
  ["100101091_101"]="The end of the Library.",
  ["100101091_102"]="What waits at the end of the hexagon?",
  ["100101091_103"]="What waits at the end of the hexagon?",
  ["100101091_104"]="For every Eme-an, that has always been the ultimate question.",
  ["100101091_105"]="No one has ever reached the end, and no one has ever returned. Therefore, the question remains unanswered.",
  ["100101091_106"]="Everyone yearns for the ultimate answer, and that is why they all end up on the Path of No Return.",
  ["100101091_107"]="However...",
  ["100101091_108"]="What exactly is the answer of that ultimate question.",
  ["100101091_109"]="At the end of the journey, the answer lies not within the Library itself.",
  ["100101091_11"]="As for deeper differences, they can't be studied simply through dissection. I don't want to ruin such a precious specimen.",
  ["100101091_110"]="But within ourselves.",
  ["100101091_12"]="Cosmos is truly amazing to have found such an intriguing toy. It surpasses my imagination. I'll shower him with praise next time I see him.",
  ["100101091_13"]="Yeah, I've been telling you for a while that your seemingly mediocre apprentice is anything but ordinary.",
  ["100101091_14"]="Ninsar suddenly recalls the eve of her departure.",
  ["100101091_15"]="Are you leaving, too?",
  ["100101091_16"]="You are... Enki's apprentice.",
  ["100101091_17"]="How interesting. I can't see your answer. Perhaps you'll reach greater heights than Enki in the future.",
  ["100101091_18"]="I'm flattered. Master Enki is a true genius, while I'm just an ordinary person who is lucky to have made it this far.",
  ["100101091_19"]="Not many admit their mediocrity.",
  ["100101091_2"]="Conference Hall",
  ["100101091_20"]="Cosmos smiles.",
  ["100101091_21"]="I don't think \"mediocrity\" is a derogatory term.",
  ["100101091_22"]="A genius is like a lone bird, rejecting everything and having no place to rest.",
  ["100101091_23"]="While mediocrity is like a tortoise, knowing its limits and moving towards a single goal.",
  ["100101091_24"]="Eventually, the tortoise reaches greater heights.",
  ["100101091_25"]="Ninsar chuckles.",
  ["100101091_26"]="A \"mediocrity\" with sharp words. What a shame that Enki hasn't seen your true nature. You've hidden your brilliance well.",
  ["100101091_27"]="Cosmos maintains his casual demeanor and changes the subject.",
  ["100101091_28"]="You have beautiful eyes. I believe they will reflect even more valuable things in the future.",
  ["100101091_29"]="May your journey ahead be filled with endless surprises and magnificence.",
  ["100101091_3"]="Enki and Ninsar watch the future successors disappear from sight.",
  ["100101091_30"]="Enki's voice pulls Ninsar back from her reminiscence.",
  ["100101091_31"]="But then again, do you think they'll eventually fall into a tragic loop just like Oedipus?",
  ["100101091_32"]="Yes, they will.",
  ["100101091_33"]="Ninsar's voice is calm, as if stating an established fact.",
  ["100101091_34"]="Otherwise, they wouldn't have met us.",
  ["100101091_35"]="Enki pauses for a moment, then chuckles.",
  ["100101091_36"]="That's true. All we can do is wish them good luck.",
  ["100101091_37"]="Well, that's not something we should be worried about.",
  ["100101091_38"]="Yeah, you're right.",
  ["100101091_39"]="But you know, it's not just Cosmos who's interesting. There's also that girl...",
  ["100101091_4"]="Enki lets out a lazy yawn.",
  ["100101091_40"]="The girl who has found the Tome of Ages? What path will she choose? I'm curious, Enki.",
  ["100101091_41"]="Did you see the answer?",
  ["100101091_42"]="Yeah, I did, but I don't know the process, as always. I don't know why, but this time, I have a feeling that maybe the process is more important than the answer itself.",
  ["100101091_43"]="It's just they haven't realized it yet.",
  ["100101091_44"]="Should we warn them?",
  ["100101091_45"]="No, only the unknown brings anticipation. I don't want to spoil the fun.",
  ["100101091_46"]="Mischievous, aren't you?",
  ["100101091_47"]="Whatever you say.",
  ["100101091_48"]="Enki jogs forward a few steps.",
  ["100101091_49"]="By the way, now that you've realized that the process is more important than the answer, don't come up with such a boring plan next time, silly sis.",
  ["100101091_5"]="Aren't you sorry for letting them go?",
  ["100101091_50"]="I haven't reached the end of my journey yet. I don't want to start preparing for an exit plan in the middle of the game and have to start over again.",
  ["100101091_51"]="...",
  ["100101091_52"]="You're just too predictable. Even if you don't tell me the answer, I can figure it out.",
  ["100101091_53"]="For a moment, the Enki in front of Ninsar resembles someone from her memory.",
  ["100101091_54"]="Remember, I've watched you both grow up. I can tell when something's up, even if you're trying to hide it.",
  ["100101091_55"]="Enki, there's nothing waiting for us at the end of this journey. We won't reach the end, find any answers, or be able to turn back.",
  ["100101091_56"]="Enki chuckles and keeps walking forward without looking back.",
  ["100101091_57"]="So what?",
  ["100101091_58"]="Ninsar stands frozen.",
  ["100101091_59"]="She has always known that her brother is more curiosity incarnate than a human being.",
  ["100101091_6"]="What are you talking about? Why would I be sorry?",
  ["100101091_60"]="Unfazed by fatigue or pain, he has cared only about moving forward from the moment he was born.",
  ["100101091_61"]="Forward. Keep pushing forward no matter the cost. Even if he stumbles and gets hurt, he will accumulate and absorb knowledge to go further.",
  ["100101091_62"]="He never turns back, never even considers it. His bright eyes always focus ahead, seeing only what lies beyond.",
  ["100101091_63"]="Watching his retreating form, Ninsar feels a sense of unease.",
  ["100101091_64"]="Why? Why wouldn't he stop? Why wouldn't he look back? Why would he leave her alone and embark on this journey by himself?",
  ["100101091_65"]="Ninsar reaches out her hand towards Enki.",
  ["100101091_66"]="(Don't go.)",
  ["100101091_67"]="(No matter how hard we struggle, we are bound by our limited lifespan. As long as we are limited by our mortal bodies, we'll never reach the end.)",
  ["100101091_68"]="(Don't go. Don't go. Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.)",
  ["100101091_69"]="(Don't leave me behind.)",
  ["100101091_7"]="I'm talking about that Seer. You actually want to study their inner workings, right? Can't believe you've actually held yourself back.",
  ["100101091_70"]="Suddenly, Enki comes to a stop.",
  ["100101091_71"]="The boy, who has never looked back before, decisively turns around and takes Ninsar's hand.",
  ["100101091_72"]="What are you waiting for?",
  ["100101091_73"]="He pulls her along, jogging forward.",
  ["100101091_74"]="Let's go!",
  ["100101091_75"]="...!",
  ["100101091_76"]="Ninsar's eyes widen.",
  ["100101091_77"]="Can't you, for once, consider your true desires, silly sis?",
  ["100101091_78"]="Out of everyone here, you're the one who wants to see the end the most, right?!",
  ["100101091_79"]="She wasn't sad at all, silly Nanna. It was all an act. She doesn't get sad.",
  ["100101091_8"]="Hey, I don't.",
  ["100101091_80"]="His words are not just a stubborn retort.",
  ["100101091_81"]="He has always known that his sister is a brilliant fool.",
  ["100101091_82"]="To her, a world without surprises or expectations has lost its value long ago.",
  ["100101091_83"]="Only the Library remains, the last unknown place, the final mystery to unravel.",
  ["100101091_84"]="She has mistaken her excitement for fear to the point where she can't even distinguish between the two anymore.",
  ["100101091_85"]="That's why he must embark on this journey, so that his silly sister will follow and step into the vast world.",
  ["100101091_86"]="Holding her brother's hand tightly, she feels the pulsating exhilaration through their intertwined fingers.",
  ["100101091_87"]="In that moment, the restless longing consumes her entirely.",
  ["100101091_88"]="After all, they are twins who share each other's desires and bear each other's pain. How could she have forgotten that?",
  ["100101091_89"]="Ninsar smiles wholeheartedly.",
  ["100101091_9"]="Enki shakes his head.",
  ["100101091_90"]="Her journey ahead is already brimming with endless surprises and magnificence.",
  ["100101091_91"]="Yeah.",
  ["100101091_92"]="Let's go.",
  ["100101091_93"]="Let's go.",
  ["100101091_94"]="From this step onward, there's no turning back.",
  ["100101091_95"]="Beyond lies either the ultimate truth or nothingness.",
  ["100101091_96"]="No one knows the answer.",
  ["100101091_97"]="Even if they stray from the path.",
  ["100101091_98"]="Even if they lose everything.",
  ["100101091_99"]="Even if all that awaits them is boundless darkness.",
  ["1001011"]="Ming",
  ["1001012"]="Qing",
  ["1001013"]="Hephae",
  ["1001014"]="Logos",
  ["1001015"]="Shamash",
  ["1001016"]="Viola",
  ["1001017"]="Nanna",
  ["1001018"]="Enki",
  ["1001019"]="Ninsar",
  ["1001020"]="Wushi",
  ["100102011_1"]="The Eternal Sun",
  ["100102011_10"]="It would be a waste to enjoy these flowers alone, so I invited you to accompany me.",
  ["100102011_100"]="If this realm were still under his rule, I might have respectfully approached their gates and dispatched a messenger to request an audience.",
  ["100102011_101"]="A man who desires to possess the sun must be as ambitious as my father.",
  ["100102011_102"]="Circa 2,510 years before World Calendar",
  ["100102011_103"]="Main Gate, Tower of Babel",
  ["100102011_104"]="Tower of Babel...",
  ["100102011_105"]="That's the only thing in the world, besides the stars, deserving of my upward gaze.",
  ["100102011_106"]="It's only fitting that the most glorious trophy should be placed in the highest place of my kingdom.",
  ["100102011_107"]="I'm now entrusting it to you, Eme-an.",
  ["100102011_108"]="What is this, Your Majesty?",
  ["100102011_109"]="A good question, and one that I would like to ask you, too.",
  ["100102011_11"]="I have also extended invitations to others. General Sarvis resides nearby in his mansion, and he should be joining us shortly.",
  ["100102011_110"]="I have heard tales that beneath the majestic waterfalls of the Memphis River lies the dormant, ancient God of the Sun.",
  ["100102011_111"]="It once destroyed the capital of an ancient pharaoh and then sank into the river.",
  ["100102011_112"]="So, I conquered the land of that pharaoh and ordered countless individuals to dive into the waters, leaving no stone unturned.",
  ["100102011_113"]="But the outcome was a great disappointment.",
  ["100102011_114"]="The so-called God of the Sun was nothing more than a copper sphere?",
  ["100102011_115"]="While it's well-crafted, the artisans of Obed could have created a work of art ten times more intricate than that.",
  ["100102011_116"]="I ordered my people to smash it on the spot.",
  ["100102011_117"]="However, even the mightiest warriors of my Immortal Army could not destroy it. No weapon could even scratch its surface.",
  ["100102011_118"]="I had craftsmen construct colossal pyres and burn it for ten days, yet its shell remained unaltered.",
  ["100102011_119"]="Finally, I instructed my warriors to transport it to the highest peak in Memphis and cast it off the cliffs, but it was the unyielding stones below that shattered, not the copper sphere.",
  ["100102011_12"]="Are you acquainted with him?",
  ["100102011_120"]="Since long ago, you have collected many extraordinary artifacts in this tower.",
  ["100102011_121"]="And you have recruited numerous scholars from my land.",
  ["100102011_122"]="I have never impeded or doubted your endeavors.",
  ["100102011_123"]="But now, I'm asking for a small favor in return.",
  ["100102011_124"]="Unravel the mystery surrounding this sphere and the reason why the Memphians revere it as the God of the Sun.",
  ["100102011_125"]="And find out the secret to its... immortality.",
  ["100102011_13"]="Yes, I know him. Sarvis is a valiant general.",
  ["100102011_14"]="Knowing him is not enough, Rubicon. As my heir, you must remain well-informed about all the developments in Javriel.",
  ["100102011_15"]="Sarvis was recently promoted to the rank of the youngest senator. It is imperative that you maintain a close relationship with him in the times to come.",
  ["100102011_16"]="Understood, father. I shall pay him a visit later.",
  ["100102011_17"]="Well, that won't be necessary. He has already arrived.",
  ["100102011_18"]="Your Majesty.",
  ["100102011_19"]="Rise, Sarvis. Now, we await the arrival of High Priest Merari.",
  ["100102011_2"]="Circa 2,000 years before World Calendar",
  ["100102011_20"]="Sarvis, you have accomplished remarkable military triumphs on my behalf. I had promised that on the day of your senatorial promotion, you may select any city within my empire as your fiefdom, excluding Javriel.",
  ["100102011_21"]="Have you made your decision?",
  ["100102011_22"]="By the grace of Your Majesty...",
  ["100102011_23"]="Ha, let's skip the formalities of the senate.",
  ["100102011_24"]="Choose your city, and I shall grant it to you. Leave the pleasantries and bureaucratic matters to others.",
  ["100102011_25"]="I desire a land as warm and inviting as Your Majesty's garden.",
  ["100102011_26"]="Heh, while numerous warm lands lie within my dominion, only one city possesses a garden-like charm.",
  ["100102011_27"]="Your discernment is commendable, for you have chosen a place even I find difficult to part with.",
  ["100102011_28"]="Very well, Bellefontaine shall be yours. Tend to her with care, for she is a unique and precious flower even amidst my vast garden.",
  ["100102011_29"]="Ah, here comes the High Priest as well.",
  ["100102011_3"]="Javriel, the Eternal City, has stood as the heart of the Japheth Empire for many centuries. As the people of the empire have come to expect, it will undoubtedly continue to do so until the end of time. The empire was vast by the time of Thurinus the Great, but the frontiers of the Emperor's ambitions were far beyond the current borders of his domain.",
  ["100102011_30"]="Greatness be upon you, my Lord. May your reign endure as long as the Tiberius River flows through the Eternal City.",
  ["100102011_31"]="Indeed, at my age, divine favor is required to sustain my rule over this nation for much longer.",
  ["100102011_32"]="Worry not, father. Your radiance shines as brightly as the sun that illuminates the entirety of Japheth.",
  ["100102011_33"]="Heh, you've picked up the rhetoric of those eloquent orators, Rubicon.",
  ["100102011_34"]="But have you ever seen a day when the sun does not set?",
  ["100102011_35"]="I mean no disrespect, father!",
  ["100102011_36"]="I know you do not.",
  ["100102011_37"]="While your words are flattering, I believe I truly merit such praise.",
  ["100102011_38"]="I no longer require badges, scepters, or crowns to demonstrate my power.",
  ["100102011_39"]="Nor do my accomplishments necessitate statues, poems, or triumphal arches to extol their glory anymore.",
  ["100102011_4"]="Royal Palace, Javriel",
  ["100102011_40"]="The senate recently bestowed upon me the title of the Sacred One. I wonder, on the day of my departure, whether the artisans will find a monument vast enough to inscribe all my titles.",
  ["100102011_41"]="Frequently, I have wondered what further achievements I can attain during my remaining time.",
  ["100102011_42"]="My generals have conquered the entire civilized world known to us, and the remaining lands are either too remote or too desolate.",
  ["100102011_43"]="My empire has transformed the Philistine Sea into an inland lake. In this regard, I have surpassed all previous emperors in history.",
  ["100102011_44"]="When I inherited Javriel, it was constructed of bricks. And when I pass it on to you, Rubicon, my beloved son, it shall be a grand Eternal City.",
  ["100102011_45"]="You mentioned the sun earlier, which brings something to mind. The governor of Memphis Province sent me a letter along with the flowers.",
  ["100102011_46"]="In his letter, he mentioned an ancient legend cherished by the people of Memphis, asserting that their God of the Sun was captured by conquerors from the East.",
  ["100102011_47"]="According to them, the conquerors hailed from a realm known as the <color=#fec66b>Arsacid Empire</color>.",
  ["100102011_48"]="Have you ever heard of that place?",
  ["100102011_49"]="To the best of my knowledge, the Arsacid Empire lies far to the east of our domain, inhabited by different people with a distinct culture. This region is situated near another sea.",
  ["100102011_5"]="Father, I have arrived.",
  ["100102011_50"]="The Memphian legend concerning the God of the Sun appears to lack veracity. It is merely a deity concocted by simplistic individuals for their own peace of mind.",
  ["100102011_51"]="I understand your piety, Merari.",
  ["100102011_52"]="However, there have been countless gods worshiped in the lands conquered by Japheth.",
  ["100102011_53"]="Since the native people believe in those gods, it implies that those gods have favored them, and we Japhethians won't interfere with their beliefs.",
  ["100102011_54"]="With that said, it is surprising to hear claims that gods walk the earth as tangible beings that can be captured like treasures.",
  ["100102011_55"]="Now, I find that interesting. Rubicon, Sarvis, and Merari, go to the Arsacid Empire and see it for me.",
  ["100102011_56"]="If the God of the Sun is truly there, bring it back to my throne. Only Javriel deserves an everlasting sun.",
  ["100102011_57"]="Father, what should we do to the kings and lands of the Arsacid Empire?",
  ["100102011_58"]="I desire the sun only. If they decline my request, destroy them all, and if they willingly relinquish it, you may decide their fate.",
  ["100102011_59"]="Well, I have spent too much time discussing a tiny piece of land. Let us enjoy these splendid water lilies before the sun sets.",
  ["100102011_6"]="Just in time, Rubicon.",
  ["100102011_60"]="Three Months Later",
  ["100102011_61"]="Main Gate, Tower of Babel",
  ["100102011_62"]="Finally...",
  ["100102011_63"]="This is...",
  ["100102011_64"]="The fabled tower that reaches the heavens...",
  ["100102011_65"]="Back in Javriel, I heard tales of it.",
  ["100102011_66"]="The tales spoke of how the ancient people aspired to reach the heavens, and thus the tower was constructed. When its foundations were laid, the land was still known by its original name, Obed.",
  ["100102011_67"]="I always believed it to be nothing more than fiction. I never imagined that the descendants of Obed continued to build upon it.",
  ["100102011_68"]="The dreams of mankind are truly remarkable.",
  ["100102011_69"]="From the way you spoke just now, one would think that we didn't emerge victorious in our great conquest, General Sarvis.",
  ["100102011_7"]="Look at the water lilies in the pond. They were brought here from Memphis.",
  ["100102011_70"]="High Priest, I am sure you can sense that even as conquerors, our splendor of victory pales in comparison to this tower.",
  ["100102011_71"]="We are facing something that cannot be conquered by force and will never bow to humans.",
  ["100102011_72"]="You speak the truth. It is not only blood and swords that evoke awe. It is the achievements built upon intangible foundations that endure.",
  ["100102011_73"]="Today, for the first time, the Japhethians bear witness to this marvel, and poets will compose new songs to commemorate this event.",
  ["100102011_74"]="This is our shared feat. Together, our names will be engraved on the next arch of triumph in Javriel.",
  ["100102011_75"]="But before the triumph, Your Highness, we have much to accomplish.",
  ["100102011_76"]="What shall we do with the subjects of the Arsacid Empire?",
  ["100102011_77"]="They have surrendered, so I have ordered our troops to cease fighting and rest.",
  ["100102011_78"]="However, if the Arsacid Empire dares to resist, His Majesty's decree is to destroy it.",
  ["100102011_79"]="...",
  ["100102011_8"]="This is a tribute from the governor of Memphis Province. The lilies were plucked twenty days ago from the banks of the Memphis River, delicately immersed in jars filled with fresh water, transported on a ship across the Philistine Sea, and swiftly brought to Javriel.",
  ["100102011_80"]="Father is the sun, and naturally, he does not concern himself with the insects scorched by his blazing light.",
  ["100102011_81"]="But the people here are far away from Japheth. It is not their fault they are unaware of His Majesty's mighty name.",
  ["100102011_82"]="I understand your point, Your Highness.",
  ["100102011_83"]="It has been said that we Japhethians are like a melting pot.",
  ["100102011_84"]="There are two points behind that statement.",
  ["100102011_85"]="First, we open our hearts and minds to all who are willing to submit. Second, if anyone is as stubborn as copper and iron, we will melt them with our fire until they become part of Japheth.",
  ["100102011_86"]="Force and fear have been the best tools your father has employed for decades. Through them, the fire of Japheth's hearth burns brighter and brighter.",
  ["100102011_87"]="I agree that those two methods are hardly the most effective.",
  ["100102011_88"]="If Your Highness allows, I will find gentler ways to integrate the Arsacid Empire into our fold.",
  ["100102011_89"]="If we can make their soldiers abandon their weapons for good, they will no longer pose a threat to us, and we will not need to shed their blood.",
  ["100102011_9"]="Today marks the onset of the flowering season.",
  ["100102011_90"]="The High Priest makes a valid point. This approach would spare the lives of those people without contradicting my father's will. What do you think, Sarvis?",
  ["100102011_91"]="Well...",
  ["100102011_92"]="I am just a general, and I focus on military affairs only. I will leave the decision on other matters to you and the High Priest.",
  ["100102011_93"]="Ah, Sarvis, it is evident that your knowledge and eloquence surpass those of your colleagues in the senate. Yet, you humbly refer to yourself as just a general.",
  ["100102011_94"]="I'll take that as a yes. High Priest, I hereby grant you the authority to handle the people of the Arsacid Empire at your discretion.",
  ["100102011_95"]="As you wish, Your Highness.",
  ["100102011_96"]="Now, it is time to claim the ultimate rewards for our arduous journey.",
  ["100102011_97"]="According to the historical accounts of the Arsacid Empire, it was the Emperor Darius who brought the God of the Sun from Memphis to Obed five centuries ago.",
  ["100102011_98"]="Darius once established the greatest empire in Obed.",
  ["100102011_99"]="He made Memphis his province long before Japheth came into power.",
  ["100102021_1"]="Arsacid Empire",
  ["100102021_10"]="The Arsacid Empire?",
  ["100102021_11"]="It was one of the dynasties that existed in Obed about two thousand years before our time.",
  ["100102021_12"]="The dynasty lasted for centuries, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly where we are within that period.",
  ["100102021_13"]="Did you just bring us to some random point in time?",
  ["100102021_14"]="I'm not sure.",
  ["100102021_15"]="I was just thinking about going back to two thousand years ago.",
  ["100102021_16"]="Can't we check the records on these scrolls to confirm the timeline?",
  ["100102021_17"]="You're quite unreliable, aren't you?",
  ["100102021_18"]="You didn't even have a specific year or coordinates in mind, just a vague idea?!",
  ["100102021_19"]="I can't believe it actually worked. Seriously, it's not like you \"scanned\" anything! It's more like cheating!",
  ["100102021_2"]="Circa 2,510 years before World Calendar",
  ["100102021_20"]="So, our new director is actually smarter than we thought.",
  ["100102021_21"]="But do you understand what the text says?",
  ["100102021_22"]="While Ereshan is busy showering me with caustic remarks, Anchirp takes the scroll from my hand and brings it to Zero.",
  ["100102021_23"]="This is a legal document about the sale of grain and a deed to a farm.",
  ["100102021_24"]="While it provides concrete information, it doesn't help us determine the exact time.",
  ["100102021_25"]="Heh, you're as reliable as ever. No wonder that old man wanted to make you the next director.",
  ["100102021_26"]="Zero ignores Ereshan's remarks and grabs several other scrolls from the nearest bookshelf, tossing them into Ereshan's arms.",
  ["100102021_27"]="Why did you throw them at me?",
  ["100102021_28"]="You can read them too, can't you?",
  ["100102021_29"]="...",
  ["100102021_3"]="The Lost Library",
  ["100102021_30"]="Annoyed, Ereshan bites her lip but starts examining the scrolls anyway.",
  ["100102021_31"]="Let's see what the heck we have here. Basic math, ledgers, lists of engineers...",
  ["100102021_32"]="Tax collection records and tribute lists... all useless information. Hmm? Wait, I've found something, Zero.",
  ["100102021_33"]="Zero approaches Ereshan and glances at the contents.",
  ["100102021_34"]="This is a record written by the court scribe of the <color=#fec66b>fifth emperor</color>.",
  ["100102021_35"]="The fifth emperor?",
  ["100102021_36"]="He was a unremarkable emperor in the history of Obed and not well-known.",
  ["100102021_37"]="Throughout its long history, Obed has been the center of powerful empires at times and has fallen under the control of other empires at other times.",
  ["100102021_38"]="The fifth emperor's reign belonged to the latter category.",
  ["100102021_39"]="During that time, the Japheth Empire in the west, ruled by Emperor Thurinus, was at its peak.",
  ["100102021_4"]="After a fleeting moment enveloped in a familiar sense of chaos, clarity begins to return to my senses.",
  ["100102021_40"]="Thurinus' armies extended to the farthest reaches of the known world in all directions.",
  ["100102021_41"]="In the east, they reached the Arsacid Empire.",
  ["100102021_42"]="During his reign, Thurinus sent an expedition army led by his son Rubicon, the High Priest Merari, and General Sarvis to Obed.",
  ["100102021_43"]="However, the expedition didn't result in Obed becoming a new province of Japheth, as was the case with other areas during that era.",
  ["100102021_44"]="The reason for the truce remains a mystery, as no records or treaties were passed down through history.",
  ["100102021_45"]="However, the Tower of Babel remained under its existing ownership during that war.",
  ["100102021_46"]="Eme-an, throughout different generations, protected it during all the crises and incidents, ensuring the Library's safety and preservation.",
  ["100102021_47"]="Tsk, that's a nice way of saying \"sitting on the fence.\"",
  ["100102021_48"]="The knowledge stored in the tower is incredibly valuable, so no one would want to destroy it, right?",
  ["100102021_49"]="Besides, those old chumps did have their talents. As long as they were willing to cooperate, no emperor in his right mind would give them a hard time.",
  ["100102021_5"]="This time, the surroundings alone declare that I have been transported back to the distance past.",
  ["100102021_50"]="So, I guess we've traveled back to 2,000 years ago?",
  ["100102021_51"]="As much as it pains me to admit it, your ability is quite remarkable.",
  ["100102021_52"]="Ereshan grunts and strides ahead of us.",
  ["100102021_53"]="Looking at her back, I can't help but quietly ask Zero:",
  ["100102021_54"]="Why can't you two ever get along?",
  ["100102021_55"]="She surely holds a grudge against us, right?",
  ["100102021_56"]="If I remember correctly, this is the second time you've asked me a question like this.",
  ["100102021_57"]="My answer is still the same, but since this is your second question, I think it's best to give you more information.",
  ["100102021_58"]="Ereshan is the daughter of the previous director.",
  ["100102021_59"]="Before my arrival, Cosmos planned to appoint her as the next director.",
  ["100102021_6"]="The shelves are filled with old yellow scrolls made of parchment and papyrus.",
  ["100102021_60"]="Before your arrival?",
  ["100102021_61"]="If she became the director... Eme-an would never know peace...",
  ["100102021_62"]="Yeah.",
  ["100102021_63"]="Similarly, before your arrival, I was supposed to become the next director.",
  ["100102021_64"]="So, you...",
  ["100102021_65"]="My duty is to safeguard this tower and the Library of Babel.",
  ["100102021_66"]="And naturally, that includes you, as the current director.",
  ["100102021_67"]="What are you two whispering about back there? Hurry up and follow me!",
  ["100102021_68"]="Alright, I'm coming.",
  ["100102021_7"]="I randomly pick a scroll and unfold it, only to find unfamiliar symbols covering its surface.",
  ["100102021_8"]="What are these symbols?",
  ["100102021_9"]="The letters used in the Arsacid Empire.",
  ["100102022_1"]="Before we can catch our breath, a rustling sound makes Ereshan and Zero turn their heads suddenly.",
  ["100102022_10"]="You're outlanders... No, wait, the symbols on your clothes...",
  ["100102022_11"]="Zero, you explain it to him.",
  ["100102022_12"]="After hearing Zero's explanation, the man remains surprisingly calm.",
  ["100102022_13"]="So, you're travelers from the future.",
  ["100102022_14"]="That's truly incredible. Since you're from the future, your clothes must also be from the future. No wonder I can't place their origin.",
  ["100102022_15"]="The Library of Babel is truly full of wonders.",
  ["100102022_16"]="Could you tell us which era we are in?",
  ["100102022_17"]="The man lets out a heavy sigh.",
  ["100102022_18"]="Since you're from the future, you probably already know that the current ruler of Obed, the fifth emperor, is a disappointment.",
  ["100102022_19"]="Yeah, and we know that the Arsacid Empire was at war with the Japheth Empire. Has the war ended?",
  ["100102022_2"]="Chirp!",
  ["100102022_20"]="The war has ended. Despite Thurinus being advanced in years, he didn't underestimate his enemy and prepared enough troops for a full-scale war.",
  ["100102022_21"]="Unfortunately, he overestimated his opponent. The fifth emperor couldn't manage a single clash on the battlefield.",
  ["100102022_22"]="As soon as he found out that Japheth only wanted a specific item from the Tower of Babel, he backed down immediately.",
  ["100102022_23"]="Hah, you don't seem to have a high opinion of your emperor. Is it acceptable for a subject to say such things?",
  ["100102022_24"]="The librarian chuckles softly.",
  ["100102022_25"]="Emperor... he's far from deserving that title.",
  ["100102022_26"]="You mentioned that Japheth only wanted a specific item from the tower. What is it?",
  ["100102022_27"]="I've heard that Rubicon's ultimatum mentioned Memphis's God of the Sun.",
  ["100102022_28"]="I've seen it a few times, but it's disappointing. It's just a huge metal ball that doesn't seem to have any connection to the sun other than its shape.",
  ["100102022_29"]="I heard it was a trophy captured by Obed's past monarch, Emperor Darius, after conquering Memphis.",
  ["100102022_3"]="Who's there?",
  ["100102022_30"]="The item was sent away by Rubicon a few days ago, and it should be close to <color=#fec66b>Ephrathah</color> on the coast of the Philistine Sea by now. Then, it will be loaded onto a ship and sent to Javriel.",
  ["100102022_31"]="Looks like we're too late.",
  ["100102022_32"]="No, not yet.",
  ["100102022_33"]="Two thousand years ago, Ephrathah by the Philistine Sea witnessed the final glimmer of Aten...",
  ["100102022_34"]="Ephrathah by the Philistine Sea? Hold on.",
  ["100102022_35"]="As Ereshan repeats Zero's words, she exchanges a glance with Zero and suddenly realizes something.",
  ["100102022_36"]="<color=#fec66b>The Star of Ephrathah</color>.",
  ["100102022_37"]="History sure loves to play tricks on us.",
  ["100102022_38"]="What Shining in Ephrathah was never a star...",
  ["100102022_39"]="It's Aten.",
  ["100102022_4"]="Ereshan raises her weapon, but Zero holds her back.",
  ["100102022_40"]="Ereshan nods and looks at the librarian.",
  ["100102022_41"]="So, you don't know how to control that copper sphere either.",
  ["100102022_42"]="No, we don't. Honestly, we wouldn't even know it's something that can be activated if you hadn't mentioned it.",
  ["100102022_43"]="But since those Japhethians are so desperate to get their hands on it, they might have some knowledge about it.",
  ["100102022_44"]="Interestingly, Prince Rubicon and his praetorians are currently stuck in the Library.",
  ["100102022_45"]="What did you just say?",
  ["100102022_46"]="Rubicon didn't leave after obtaining that God of the Sun. He learned about us and the Library of Babel from the fifth emperor.",
  ["100102022_47"]="Rubicon considered the Library a treasure far more valuable than that copper sphere, so he took his soldiers inside the Tower of Babel.",
  ["100102022_48"]="It happened to coincide with the opening of the library, so I'm not sure if we should call it lucky or unlucky.",
  ["100102022_49"]="So, you mean we can find him inside the Library of Babel?",
  ["100102022_5"]="Wait.",
  ["100102022_50"]="Exactly.",
  ["100102022_51"]="Unfortunately, I won't be able to accompany you for the rest of your journey. I need to find my companions as soon as possible.",
  ["100102022_52"]="That's alright. Thank you for all the information.",
  ["100102022_53"]="May the Library be with you, Eme-an from the future.",
  ["100102022_6"]="The figure, realizing his presence discovered, emerges from behind the bookshelf and shows himself.",
  ["100102022_7"]="As both sides recognize each other, everyone's eyes widen in surprise.",
  ["100102022_8"]="You are...",
  ["100102022_9"]="Zero pauses, letting the man speak instead.",
  ["100102031_1"]="The Star of Ephrathah",
  ["100102031_10"]="Until just now. Considering the time and location, it's safe to say that the Star of Ephrathah is Aten, which the Japhethians transported from the Arsacid Empire.",
  ["100102031_11"]="Although it lasted only for a brief period, it did ascend back into the sky, emanating radiance and brilliance.",
  ["100102031_12"]="The only question is this: who in this era discovered the command to activate it?",
  ["100102031_2"]="Now we know exactly what to do next.",
  ["100102031_3"]="Hopefully, we'll find something this time. Since the Japhethians are after that copper sphere, they must have heard something about it, right?",
  ["100102031_4"]="The Star of Ephrathah you just mentioned...",
  ["100102031_5"]="Oh, it was an anomaly that appeared in Ephrathah, near the western shore of the Philistine Sea, around 2000 B.C.",
  ["100102031_6"]="According to historical records, a solitary star of unparalleled splendor emerged in the night sky above Ephrathah. Unlike other stars, it remained fixed over Ephrathah.",
  ["100102031_7"]="The star was visible along the entire coast of the Philistine Sea, but it vanished shortly after its appearance and hasn't been recorded in any astronomical observations since.",
  ["100102031_8"]="Naturally, some might consider it a collective illusion, but for us Eme-ans, it was an undeniable anomaly.",
  ["100102031_9"]="Since there were no Eme-ans in Ephrathah at that time, the truth behind this incident has remained a mystery for thousands of years.",
  ["100102051_1"]="Sarvis",
  ["100102051_10"]="It's alright. They're the hosts here. It's only natural for them to ask the names of their guests.",
  ["100102051_11"]="I am Sarvis, a senator of Japheth and a general serving Prince Rubicon.",
  ["100102051_12"]="Lord Thurinus is a benevolent emperor who welcomes scholars from all corners of the world. We will be returning in a few days, and if you are interested in joining us, I can take you back to Javriel.",
  ["100102051_13"]="But of course, that's on the condition that you lead us out of this fantastic labyrinth.",
  ["100102051_14"]="I've heard that Rubicon's ultimatum mentioned Memphis's God of the Sun.",
  ["100102051_15"]="Until just now. Considering the time and location, it's safe to say that the Star of Ephrathah is Aten, which the Japhethians transported from the Arsacid Empire.",
  ["100102051_16"]="Ephrathah, Aten, Japhethians...",
  ["100102051_17"]="The scattered clues start to form a bigger picture.",
  ["100102051_18"]="So, you're the ones who took away Aten.",
  ["100102051_19"]="Aten? You mean the ancient God of the Sun in Memphis?",
  ["100102051_2"]="Oh? You're just in time.",
  ["100102051_20"]="We've traveled all the way here to retrieve it.",
  ["100102051_21"]="Do you have a problem with that?",
  ["100102051_22"]="Because we, too, are here for Aten.",
  ["100102051_23"]="Sarvis appeared unsurprised by my response.",
  ["100102051_24"]="During our journey, my men gathered many records about Aten, and I've heard about your research on the God of the Sun.",
  ["100102051_25"]="But there's nothing I can do, as His Majesty has decreed that if there is a sun on Earth, it shall only rise above the Eternal City and shine down upon his throne.",
  ["100102051_26"]="As for the emperor of Arsacid, well, I don't think his lousy chair deserves such high honor.",
  ["100102051_27"]="Obed witnessed the rise of its first sun-wielding monarch, Darius. It's such a shame that his successor would fall so far.",
  ["100102051_28"]="Ereshan narrows her eyes and starts fishing for information.",
  ["100102051_29"]="Since you've come here for Aten, you must know how to harness it, right?",
  ["100102051_3"]="Although we haven't met, judging by the patterns on your garments, I assume you are Eme-ans, the caretakers of this ancient tower, correct?",
  ["100102051_30"]="Sarvis furrows his brow.",
  ["100102051_31"]="What do you mean by \"harnessing\" it? Are you suggesting it's a living being that can be controlled?",
  ["100102051_32"]="Yeah, with the right commands, you can order it to do anything you want. Wait, you didn't know that?",
  ["100102051_33"]="Commands? So, that metal ball understands commands?",
  ["100102051_34"]="Of course it does! How else did you make it float above Ephrathah?",
  ["100102051_35"]="How did you deactivate it in the end?",
  ["100102051_36"]="Float? Ephrathah? Deactivate? I'm utterly puzzled by what you're saying.",
  ["100102051_37"]="I've heard that \"Eme-an\" means \"mouthpieces of the gods\" in ancient languages.",
  ["100102051_38"]="It is said that your task is to listen to prayers and provide answers, not ask questions.",
  ["100102051_39"]="If you have forgotten your duties after all these years, I don't mind reminding you.",
  ["100102051_4"]="The vastness of this world is truly beyond mortal imagination. When I first heard about the Library of Babel, I dismissed it as mere ramblings of the common folk.",
  ["100102051_40"]="His gaze suddenly turns cold.",
  ["100102051_41"]="Or are you trying to buy time?",
  ["100102051_42"]="Are you using this labyrinth to separate us from Prince Rubicon and now asking questions to stall for time?",
  ["100102051_43"]="Completely composed, he steps in our direction, and the soldiers around him raise their weapons, closing in.",
  ["100102051_44"]="At that moment, Zero positions herself in front of me.",
  ["100102051_45"]="We didn't mean that.",
  ["100102051_46"]="You're misunderstanding us.",
  ["100102051_47"]="I also hope this is a misunderstanding, but your words and actions lack sincerity.",
  ["100102051_48"]="If you want to clear up this misunderstanding, please lead us out of this labyrinth.",
  ["100102051_49"]="I've already made it clear.",
  ["100102051_5"]="Turns out this marvel really exists. I'm sure the Japhethian poets will compose a thousand new epics about it. Allow me to express my sincere admiration.",
  ["100102051_50"]="We're here for Aten.",
  ["100102051_51"]="Give us Aten first.",
  ["100102051_52"]="Otherwise, we won't offer any help.",
  ["100102051_53"]="What a shame. It seems you're intentionally delaying my return to His Highness.",
  ["100102051_54"]="We have traveled all the way here but failed to find worthy opponents, and my soldiers are eager for a proper fight.",
  ["100102051_55"]="Now, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to fulfill their wish. Show us your legendary skills, Eme-ans.",
  ["100102051_56"]="Take them down.",
  ["100102051_6"]="However, as you can see, we are lost inside this tower. Could you show us the way out?",
  ["100102051_7"]="May I ask you...",
  ["100102051_8"]="Who are you?",
  ["100102051_9"]="Watch your tongue! A commoner like you has no right...",
  ["100102052_1"]="The chaos disperses...",
  ["100102052_10"]="Have you forgotten our agreement?",
  ["100102052_11"]="Agreement?",
  ["100102052_12"]="What agreement?",
  ["100102052_13"]="Sarvis raises his hand, and the surrounding soldiers immediately step back and kneel before us.",
  ["100102052_14"]="This unexpected twist leaves Ereshan and Zero stunned.",
  ["100102052_15"]="Meanwhile, Sarvis steps forward and takes my hand.",
  ["100102052_16"]="Thanks, Eme-ans. You truly are the mouthpieces of the gods.",
  ["100102052_17"]="Following the divine words you delivered, we managed to appease the wrath of the God of the Sun.",
  ["100102052_18"]="It is you who have saved the world from destruction and allowed us to witness the true sun once more.",
  ["100102052_19"]="The people of Japheth, the Arsacid Empire, and all other regions should be grateful for the news you brought.",
  ["100102052_2"]="However, the scene that unfolds freezes everyone in place.",
  ["100102052_20"]="Wait, we saved the world from destruction?",
  ["100102052_21"]="Is this another misunderstanding or something?",
  ["100102052_22"]="Zero tilts her head in confusion.",
  ["100102052_23"]="Ereshan steps forward and positions herself between Sarvis and me.",
  ["100102052_24"]="What are you even talking about?",
  ["100102052_25"]="Her words snap Sarvis out of his excitement.",
  ["100102052_26"]="He reaches into his armor and takes out a piece of parchment.",
  ["100102052_27"]="I apologize for my excessive enthusiasm. This is the note you asked me to write down...",
  ["100102052_28"]="Before Sarvis finishes his sentence, Ereshan's eyes light up as she reaches out towards Sarvis.",
  ["100102052_29"]="However, just as her fingertips are about to touch the corner of the parchment, a violent tremor shakes the ground beneath us.",
  ["100102052_3"]="Instead of escaping from Sarvis and his soldiers, we find ourselves right in the midst of their encirclement.",
  ["100102052_30"]="It feels like a powerful force is about to erupt from below.",
  ["100102052_31"]="In that moment, an intense sense of unease washes over me.",
  ["100102052_32"]="Ereshan!",
  ["100102052_33"]="Zero!",
  ["100102052_34"]="Tsk!",
  ["100102052_35"]="Ereshan quickly pulls her hand back and swiftly carries me over her shoulder, leaping away from the area.",
  ["100102052_36"]="...",
  ["100102052_37"]="Without hesitation, Zero scoops me up in her arms and jumps away from the danger.",
  ["100102052_38"]="In the next instant, a colossal figure falls from the sky and lands in front of us.",
  ["100102052_4"]="Is your time travel ability malfunctioning or what? Are you sure you've sent us a month ahead?!",
  ["100102052_5"]="Before I can answer Ereshan's questions, I notice Sarvis walking directly towards me.",
  ["100102052_6"]="Please stand down.",
  ["100102052_7"]="Looking at Zero, who takes a defensive stance, Sarvis displays a slightly surprised expression.",
  ["100102052_8"]="Dear Eme-an, I bear no ill intentions.",
  ["100102052_9"]="His gaze shifts from Zero to me.",
  ["100102053_2"]="Take us back to 500 years ago, to Darius' era.",
  ["100102053_3"]="Calm down and look at me.",
  ["100102053_4"]="Are you trying to get yourselves killed?!",
  ["100102053_5"]="No, this won't get us anywhere.",
  ["100102053_6"]="Don't you dare run away!",
  ["100102053_7"]="Run.",
  ["100102061_1"]="King Herod",
  ["100102061_10"]="Where are those Eme-ans now?",
  ["100102061_11"]="I apologize, Your Highness. I had intended to capture them alive and gather more information.",
  ["100102061_12"]="Although they were skilled fighters, their lack of coordination made them vulnerable, and we could have easily defeated them.",
  ["100102061_13"]="However, just as my soldiers closed in on them, they vanished into thin air.",
  ["100102061_14"]="At first, I thought it was an illusion, but the marks left on my soldiers' weapons and armor are undeniably real.",
  ["100102061_15"]="Sarvis, after witnessing numerous miracles in the library, are you still amazed by such minor happenings?",
  ["100102061_16"]="I won't be surprised by anything that happens within those infinite rooms.",
  ["100102061_17"]="It astonishes me that Obed possesses such a treasure. If the claims of those Eme-ans are true, the Library of Babel contains answers to all questions in the world.",
  ["100102061_18"]="Regardless, that copper sphere, even if it is connected to the sun, doesn't matter anymore.",
  ["100102061_19"]="The sun rises every day, but it doesn't provide answers to humanity's questions about the world.",
  ["100102061_2"]="One month ago.",
  ["100102061_20"]="Speaking of which, how is the negotiation progressing, High Priest?",
  ["100102061_21"]="The clerks have prepared the necessary documents, stating that the Arsacid Empire will become our vassal state in exchange for our protection. Once you add your signature, the contract will be sealed.",
  ["100102061_22"]="There is no need. The treaty is now null and void.",
  ["100102061_23"]="Disseminate my orders. Instruct our soldiers to besiege the city.",
  ["100102061_24"]="We shall capture Obed, seize the tower, and claim the library for Japheth.",
  ["100102061_25"]="The library of the gods... I never realized that such a wondrous place truly existed in this world.",
  ["100102061_26"]="Your Highness?",
  ["100102061_27"]="I understand your perplexity, General.",
  ["100102061_28"]="While reneging on our word is dishonorable, let's consider the fact that the Arsacid Empire is corrupt, and its emperor is an imbecile.",
  ["100102061_29"]="If they attempt to exploit the power within the tower for nefarious purposes in the future...",
  ["100102061_3"]="Main Gate, Tower of Babel",
  ["100102061_30"]="I believe you comprehend my concerns, Sarvis... Only Japheth possesses the power to safeguard this marvel from the unworthy.",
  ["100102061_31"]="...",
  ["100102061_32"]="A cloud of dust rises from the distant road.",
  ["100102061_33"]="A swift horse is approaching, Your Highness.",
  ["100102061_34"]="The rider appears to be a messenger.",
  ["100102061_35"]="Bring him to me.",
  ["100102061_36"]="Greetings, Your Highness!",
  ["100102061_37"]="Rise. From where do you hail, and what tidings do you bring?",
  ["100102061_38"]="Your Highness, you commanded my unit to escort the God of the Sun back to Javriel.",
  ["100102061_39"]="Several days ago, we arrived at Ephrathah on the eastern shore of the Philistine Sea, which is under Herod's dominion.",
  ["100102061_4"]="I'm grateful, Your Highness. If it weren't for your intervention, I might have been lost in that labyrinth forever.",
  ["100102061_40"]="I know. Herod is one of my father's numerous vassals.",
  ["100102061_41"]="Did he show any disrespect toward you?",
  ["100102061_42"]="No, quite the contrary. He treated us with great respect and insisted warmly that we stay at his royal court for the night.",
  ["100102061_43"]="Then, at midnight, while we were sleeping, we were awakened by a radiant glow outside the palace. We went to investigate, and to our astonishment, the sun had risen beneath the stars!",
  ["100102061_44"]="Did the wine addle your senses? What nonsense are you talking about?",
  ["100102061_45"]="What I speak is the truth, Your Highness! We witnessed it with our own eyes!",
  ["100102061_46"]="Go on. Tell me what happened.",
  ["100102061_47"]="Herod's Palace, Ephrathah",
  ["100102061_48"]="Well, my servants, the soldiers slumber now.",
  ["100102061_49"]="Now, it's time for you to fulfill your promise to me.",
  ["100102061_5"]="Don't mention it. High Priest Merari insisted on bringing the Eme-ans along, and it turned out to be a wise decision. Otherwise, we would have been trapped on that endless stairway forever.",
  ["100102061_50"]="And should you dare to deceive me, your suffering will be a thousandfold worse than your darkest nightmare.",
  ["100102061_51"]="Disregarding the blades pressed against their throats, the slaves from Memphis bow their heads.",
  ["100102061_52"]="Your Majesty, every word we speak is true.",
  ["100102061_53"]="Our ancestors were once priests of Memphis, serving pharaohs for generations in the distant past. After the kingdom of pharaohs crumbled, we were exiled but fortunate enough to find shelter in your court.",
  ["100102061_54"]="Our deepest secrets are never recorded but passed down through oral tradition among our closest blood relations.",
  ["100102061_55"]="Among them lies the secret of the God of the Sun...",
  ["100102061_56"]="During the era of Pharaoh Akhenaten, the priests discovered how to harness the power of the sun, bending it to the Pharaoh's will.",
  ["100102061_57"]="It is the language of the gods. Merely recite the divine words, and the sun will rise at your command. Through it, you shall attain divinity and achieve immortality, just as the ancient pharaohs did.",
  ["100102061_58"]="Herod sneers.",
  ["100102061_59"]="Yet you do not hesitate to share such \"deepest secrets\" with me.",
  ["100102061_6"]="Speaking of Eme-ans... I encountered a few of them in the tower, and they were dressed in a peculiar fashion.",
  ["100102061_60"]="It's precisely because you are a benevolent and generous ruler. That's why we're willing to reveal these secrets to you.",
  ["100102061_61"]="Skillfully, the slave continues to persuade Herod.",
  ["100102061_62"]="Thurinus is nothing more than a tyrant who has ravaged our land. If it were not for your generosity, we would all be living as mere livestock now.",
  ["100102061_63"]="Your Majesty, I cannot bear to see you continue to bow before that tyrant.",
  ["100102061_64"]="Benevolent? Generous? Such descriptions are rare, but you're correct about one thing. We are both kings, so why should I kneel before that tyrant and allow my country to be reduced to a mere province of Japheth?",
  ["100102061_65"]="Herod rises from his throne.",
  ["100102061_66"]="Very well. Let me see for myself if your claims hold true.",
  ["100102061_67"]="The lips of the slave, kneeling below the throne, curl into a silent smile. He murmurs softly as if in prayer, at a volume only he can hear.",
  ["100102061_68"]="All deeds have consequences. All debts must be paid.",
  ["100102061_69"]="By this time, Herod has reached the copper sphere in the courtyard, beginning to recite the so-called \"divine words\" as instructed by the slave.",
  ["100102061_7"]="They mentioned something beyond my comprehension.",
  ["100102061_70"]="The lines on the surface of the sphere gradually illuminate.",
  ["100102061_71"]="Like the reopening of an eye that has been dormant for too long.",
  ["100102061_72"]="A faint light emanates from the copper sphere, causing it to tremble gently and detach itself from the ground.",
  ["100102061_73"]="Flames erupt from the sphere, unleashing waves of heat that disperse the cool night air. A small circular patch of dawn appears in the middle of Herod's garden.",
  ["100102061_74"]="All eyes are filled with astonishment as the copper sphere ascends slowly towards the stars, shrinking in size even as its light grows brighter.",
  ["100102061_75"]="It resembles a new star.",
  ["100102061_76"]="Arise, sun...",
  ["100102061_77"]="From this moment onward, even the stars shall pale in comparison to the sun I have awakened!",
  ["100102061_8"]="According to them, the copper sphere we transported back to Japheth appears to be a living entity or a device that can be activated through specific commands.",
  ["100102061_9"]="They also claimed that the ancient God of the Sun in Memphis would rise again over Ephrathah, and they held us responsible for this occurrence.",
  ["100102071_1"]="Darius",
  ["100102071_10"]="Are you being sarcastic?",
  ["100102071_11"]="Well, it depends on how you interpret what I'm saying.",
  ["100102071_12"]="Ignoring our banter, Zero heads straight for Ereshan, placing her hand on the bookshelf beside Ereshan.",
  ["100102071_13"]="What, finally done dealing with me? The former No. 1 director candidate?",
  ["100102071_14"]="Without responding, Zero grabs a thick scroll from the bookshelf and starts examining it.",
  ["100102071_15"]="...",
  ["100102071_16"]="The unfurled scroll reveals unfamiliar glyphs, which are quite different from the previous Arsacid Empire text.",
  ["100102071_17"]="The Collected Letters of Obed Royal Family.",
  ["100102071_18"]="Volume III: Darius, the King of All Kings, written by a historian from the Obed Court.",
  ["100102071_19"]="The second half is blank. Looks like this volume is incomplete.",
  ["100102071_2"]="2,490 years before the World Calendar",
  ["100102071_20"]="It appears that we have indeed arrived in the era of Darius, around five hundred years before the fifth emperor's reign.",
  ["100102071_21"]="You mean, the era when Obed still had control over the God of the Sun?",
  ["100102071_22"]="Zero nods.",
  ["100102071_23"]="That Eme-an we encountered mentioned that Darius was the one who first brought Aten from Memphis to Obed.",
  ["100102071_24"]="Sarvis also mentioned that Darius was the first ruler of Obed to harness the power of the sun.",
  ["100102071_25"]="I see. The fact that the Japheth soldiers didn't know the command to activate Aten suggests that it had already been lost by their time.",
  ["100102071_26"]="Compared to the era of Japheth, the era of Darius was closer to the era of Aten, which means Darius is more likely to know the command to activate Aten.",
  ["100102071_27"]="Besides, there's something else that concerns me.",
  ["100102071_28"]="The giant we just encountered. Actually, we might have encountered it once before.",
  ["100102071_29"]="Back in our time, when you entered the Tower of Babel and activated the dormant Beacon, we came across something very similar, Seer.",
  ["100102071_3"]="My body has grown accustomed to the sensation of time travel.",
  ["100102071_30"]="Memories flood back as I recall the giant standing in front of the monolith.",
  ["100102071_31"]="Something doesn't quite match up, though.",
  ["100102071_32"]="The giants we ran into the first time only had its upper body.",
  ["100102071_33"]="Indeed, the giant in our time was missing its lower half, so I can't say for sure if it's the same giant.",
  ["100102071_34"]="Moreover, I'm sure you remember the stuff we got from the mutilated giant.",
  ["100102071_35"]="Zero holds out her hand, revealing a fragment of a crown that fell from the giant.",
  ["100102071_36"]="According to Master Ninsar, it belonged to Darius.",
  ["100102071_37"]="So, it must have come from this era.",
  ["100102071_38"]="A peculiar feeling washes over me.",
  ["100102071_39"]="It is as if all the threads of time have intertwined into a massive knot somewhere in the depths of history.",
  ["100102071_4"]="Once again, my vision becomes clear. The empty library, illuminated by the candlelight within the fire pit, is filled with tiny specks of dust floating in the air.",
  ["100102071_40"]="All the clues we've gathered so far are like scattered leaves from the same tree, and behind each leaf, we catch a glimpse of the blurry figure of Darius.",
  ["100102071_41"]="Sorry for interrupting your discussion, but that was the first time I saw that huge guy.",
  ["100102071_42"]="So, that giant has been after you? What did you do to anger it so much?",
  ["100102071_43"]="We didn't do anything.",
  ["100102071_44"]="And there's one more thing: Sarvis.",
  ["100102071_45"]="The second time we met Sarvis, his attitude was completely different.",
  ["100102071_46"]="Dear Eme-an, I bear no ill intentions.",
  ["100102071_47"]="Have you forgotten our agreement?",
  ["100102071_48"]="We don't have enough information to understand the reason behind it yet.",
  ["100102071_49"]="One moment he wanted to kill us, and the next moment he was happy to see us.",
  ["100102071_5"]="The serenity of the surroundings makes the intense moment of life and death seem as unreal as hallucinations.",
  ["100102071_50"]="Zero freezes, as if she remembers something.",
  ["100102071_51"]="Just to confirm, when we met Sarvis for the second time, it was a month after our first encounter, right?",
  ["100102071_52"]="Exactly.",
  ["100102071_53"]="I believe so.",
  ["100102071_54"]="...",
  ["100102071_55"]="Did you figure something out? Or...",
  ["100102071_56"]="Ereshan's words trail off as she seems to realize something as well.",
  ["100102071_57"]="At that moment, I realize something, too.",
  ["100102071_58"]="There is only one situation that can explain the drastic change in Sarvis' attitude, and there is only one miracle that matches his description of \"appeasing the wrath of the God of the Sun.\"",
  ["100102071_59"]="Could it be during the month...",
  ["100102071_6"]="Ereshan leans against the nearest bookshelf.",
  ["100102071_60"]="Aten was activated and then deactivated?",
  ["100102071_61"]="I'm afraid so.",
  ["100102071_62"]="Sarvis didn't have a clue about Aten's activation during our first encounter. But in the second encounter, he mentioned that they had somehow appeased the wrath of the God of the Sun.",
  ["100102071_63"]="So, during that month, Aten must have been reactivated and turned into the Star of Ephrathah.",
  ["100102071_64"]="Sarvis also said that we delivered divine words and saved the world from destruction.",
  ["100102071_65"]="It means that we were the ones who helped deactivate Aten, extinguishing the Star of Ephrathah.",
  ["100102071_66"]="But we don't even know the command yet.",
  ["100102071_67"]="How could we have possibly helped them?",
  ["100102071_68"]="...",
  ["100102071_69"]="The two of them exchange a glance, staying quiet for a few seconds.",
  ["100102071_7"]="Phew, I take back what I said about our director being an imbecile.",
  ["100102071_70"]="Remember what Enki said?",
  ["100102071_71"]="Be careful. The prophecy may actualize itself.",
  ["100102071_72"]="Actions taken to prevent tragedy can end up causing it.",
  ["100102071_73"]="Now I understand that Sarvis wasn't exaggerating when he said we saved the entire world from destruction.",
  ["100102071_74"]="After Aten was reactivated, its power must have kept increasing, just like when it destroyed Ehtaton.",
  ["100102071_75"]="Imagine what would happen if a fusion reactor continues to increase its power output without being shut down.",
  ["100102071_76"]="We obtained the command and delivered it to Sarvis. However, it wasn't us from the present.",
  ["100102071_77"]="Rather, it was us from some point in the future.",
  ["100102071_78"]="Because of our time travels, the prophecy actualized itself.",
  ["100102071_79"]="Shall we move on?",
  ["100102071_8"]="Having a time machine at our disposal is actually pretty convenient.",
  ["100102071_80"]="We must move on.",
  ["100102071_81"]="Yeah, of course.",
  ["100102071_82"]="There is no other choice.",
  ["100102071_83"]="Now we're not just responsible for saving the Library in our era, but also saving the world in Sarvis' era.",
  ["100102071_84"]="We must move on and find the command to deactivate Aten.",
  ["100102071_85"]="And deliver it to Sarvis.",
  ["100102071_86"]="If we fail, both eras will veer off their intended paths and collapse completely.",
  ["100102071_87"]="What would happen then?",
  ["100102071_88"]="I'm not going to answer that.",
  ["100102071_89"]="There are a bunch of geezers in Eme-an who specialize in time paradoxes.",
  ["100102071_9"]="Is that supposed to be a compliment?",
  ["100102071_90"]="I've never paid attention to their lectures. All I know is that it would be very, very, very bad.",
  ["100102071_91"]="Ereshan scoffs and strides ahead.",
  ["100102071_92"]="A sense of intense unease starts creeping into my mind.",
  ["100102071_93"]="Are we moving forward by our own will, or are we being manipulated by an invisible force called \"destiny\"?",
  ["100102071_94"]="No one can answer that question.",
  ["100102072_1"]="This era... it's truly weird.",
  ["100102072_10"]="The records about Eme-an are not detailed, as their leader, Pythagoras, mysteriously vanished without a trace one day.",
  ["100102072_11"]="Eme-an's historical records are all but blank during this era.",
  ["100102072_12"]="There are simply too many \"coincidences\" happening in this era. We need to be extra cautious.",
  ["100102072_2"]="Obviously, those Immortal Army soldiers have been wandering around inside the Library for quite some time.",
  ["100102072_3"]="Otherwise, they wouldn't be so worn out.",
  ["100102072_4"]="What exactly happened?",
  ["100102072_5"]="Can you tell me more about Darius' achievements?",
  ["100102072_6"]="What about Eme-ans in this era?",
  ["100102072_7"]="Emperor Darius was the ruler of the ancient Obed Empire 2,500 years before our time. He was one of the most renowned rulers in Obed's history.",
  ["100102072_8"]="Unlike the Obed Empire under the fifth emperor's rule, Obed during Darius' reign was the most powerful empire in the world.",
  ["100102072_9"]="Towards the end of his reign, though, Emperor Darius inexplicably shifted his focus away from governing the empire, leading to a rapid decline of Obed.",
  ["100102081_1"]="Under the Bright Stars",
  ["100102081_10"]="Not at all, Farhad. I am pleased with your valor.",
  ["100102081_11"]="After this battle, I've annexed the southern reaches of the world into my domain.",
  ["100102081_12"]="I'm staying away from the crowds to gaze at the stars. The campfire's brightness would obscure their light.",
  ["100102081_13"]="Have you ever considered where our conquest will end, Farhad?",
  ["100102081_14"]="No, Your Majesty. I shall fight wherever you deem necessary.",
  ["100102081_15"]="Until the farthest reaches of your dominion touch the sea or until I fall on the battlefield.",
  ["100102081_16"]="Ha-ha, your loyalty is commendable.",
  ["100102081_17"]="But what I'm seeing now is even more distant than the sea.",
  ["100102081_18"]="There was an Eme-an scholar named Pythagoras who told me that, according to his research, the land beneath our feet is a sphere.",
  ["100102081_19"]="A sphere? How is that even possible?",
  ["100102081_2"]="2,500 years before the World Calendar",
  ["100102081_20"]="You're not a scholar, so it's understandable that you can't imagine it.",
  ["100102081_21"]="However, I can easily imagine that there may exist countless such spheres suspended high above the heavens.",
  ["100102081_22"]="We call those spheres stars.",
  ["100102081_23"]="The notion that these stars are fragments of earth adrift in the firmament...",
  ["100102081_24"]="So many uncharted territories awaiting conquest... Do you understand my feelings, Farhad?",
  ["100102081_25"]="In comparison, Memphis, no... even the entirety of Obed pales in significance.",
  ["100102081_26"]="I wonder how I can travel to those stars to conquer those lands no one has ever seen...",
  ["100102081_27"]="How pathetic is a man so bound by his desires. From now on, I shall find no peace in my nights.",
  ["100102081_28"]="Fret not, Your Majesty. We, the Immortal Army, will always be your keenest blades.",
  ["100102081_29"]="Even if you were to command us to conquer the moon, we would comply without hesitation.",
  ["100102081_3"]="The stars... they appear so distant yet shine so brightly...",
  ["100102081_30"]="Hahahaha!",
  ["100102081_31"]="You truly are my favorite servant, Farhad.",
  ["100102081_32"]="Arise, for I shall share my glory and dreams with you.",
  ["100102081_33"]="One day, we'll leave our footprints across the entire expanse of the sky!",
  ["100102081_34"]="The Great Emperor reaches out his hand towards the sky.",
  ["100102081_35"]="Yet the touch of his fingers is chillingly cold.",
  ["100102081_36"]="Slowly, the aged emperor sits up in his bed.",
  ["100102081_37"]="So, it was but a dream.",
  ["100102081_38"]="I'm feeling cold.",
  ["100102081_39"]="Am I already so old that I'm plagued by such vivid dreams?",
  ["100102081_4"]="Your Majesty, Farhad requests an audience.",
  ["100102081_40"]="I used to believe that only the inept dream, for they possess nothing in reality.",
  ["100102081_41"]="Is the heaven telling me that I'm no different from those commoners?",
  ["100102081_42"]="My time is running out.",
  ["100102081_43"]="Main Gate, Tower of Babel",
  ["100102081_44"]="Eme-ans...",
  ["100102081_45"]="I'm summoning you to demand an answer I have long awaited.",
  ["100102081_46"]="A decade has passed since my triumph in Memphis.",
  ["100102081_47"]="I have given you so much time to unravel the mysteries of the God of the Sun.",
  ["100102081_48"]="My subjects comply with my commands, never disturbing your research or prying into your tower.",
  ["100102081_49"]="Only during the sixth and final month of each year do my emissaries visit you to ask about the progress of your research.",
  ["100102081_5"]="It is you, my most courageous servant. How does the wine taste at the celebration?",
  ["100102081_50"]="You should know that this is a supreme honor and that I have shown you extraordinary generosity, which no other Obed emperors have ever bestowed upon you.",
  ["100102081_51"]="However, my messengers disappointed me every time, as your response of \"nothing\" has remained unchanged.",
  ["100102081_52"]="Now, I've decided to ask you this question myself.",
  ["100102081_53"]="This is your tenth year. Have you learned more about the nature of that copper sphere? What grants it immortality?",
  ["100102081_54"]="Your Majesty, our answer remains the same.",
  ["100102081_55"]="You may perceive ten years as a considerable length of time. For a human life, it is indeed substantial.",
  ["100102081_56"]="However, for those devoted to the pursuit of knowledge, it is merely a fleeting moment akin to the evaporation of morning dew.",
  ["100102081_57"]="Undoubtedly, that sphere represents a creation that transcends the limits of human understanding. Even if it is not a deity in its own right, its creator must possess divine qualities.",
  ["100102081_58"]="We need more time to figure out its true essence.",
  ["100102081_59"]="...",
  ["100102081_6"]="The wine was exquisite, befitting the conquerors of Memphis.",
  ["100102081_60"]="Time... ah, time... what an extravagant request! I, too, would grant you more time if I were able.",
  ["100102081_61"]="Unfortunately, the time given to me is dwindling. The sand in the hourglass is running out.",
  ["100102081_62"]="I am growing old, and my time is slipping away, while the boundless unconquered worlds still await me.",
  ["100102081_63"]="I'm asking you once again, Eme-an. Do you, indeed, have nothing to give me in return?",
  ["100102081_64"]="Your Majesty, I hold you in the highest regard, but I must inform you that neither your majesty nor your power hold sway within the realm of knowledge.",
  ["100102081_65"]="Though you may command all on Earth to declare that the sun rises in the west, it will still be the eastern sky that illuminates the next dawn.",
  ["100102081_66"]="I can assure you that we're more eager than you are to learn the nature of the sphere. It is the calling of the scholar.",
  ["100102081_67"]="...",
  ["100102081_68"]="I see. You're unable to offer what I seek in exchange for my leniency.",
  ["100102081_69"]="I extend my regrets to you, Eme-an.",
  ["100102081_7"]="We all wonder why you didn't join us in the great feast of honor?",
  ["100102081_70"]="Since the beginning of history, this will be the first time the Emperor of Obed resorts to violence against Eme-an.",
  ["100102081_71"]="If I had a choice, I wouldn't wish to make this decision.",
  ["100102081_72"]="You may rule over this land, Your Majesty, and while you may intimidate those who seek knowledge, the laws governing knowledge itself do not yield to mere might.",
  ["100102081_73"]="Immortal Army, at my command! Open this tower and seize their library!",
  ["100102081_74"]="If this library is as miraculous as the legends proclaim, containing the sum of all worldly knowledge, it must surely hold the secret to immortality and the immortal power of that copper sphere.",
  ["100102081_75"]="Since the mouthpieces of the gods remain silent to my request, I'll uncover the answer myself.",
  ["100102081_76"]="We can't prevent you if you're determined to do so, Your Majesty. Permit me, however, to offer a final piece of advice: the gods remain silent due to the folly of humankind.",
  ["100102081_77"]="That was the last question I will ever pose to you. From now on, you are no longer permitted to address me.",
  ["100102081_78"]="Immortal Army, storm their tower and breach their gates.",
  ["100102081_79"]="Eme-an, I have heard tales that the paths within the Library of Babel are more numerous than the stars in the sky, and the smallest misstep can lead to eternal wandering.",
  ["100102081_8"]="Why do you remain secluded in this corner, far from the bonfire, without even a single guard?",
  ["100102081_80"]="I've also heard you've devoted countless time and lives to explore that library and that you've even familiarized yourselves with a number of safe paths.",
  ["100102081_81"]="I command you to lead the way for my warriors.",
  ["100102081_82"]="And you have no right to refuse.",
  ["100102081_9"]="Have we done anything to displease you?",
  ["100102091_1"]="Farhad",
  ["100102091_2"]="I look at the two ladies in front of me, who are deep in thought.",
  ["100102091_3"]="There are so many Immortal Army soldier here...",
  ["100102091_4"]="Maybe we can find someone we can reason with.",
  ["100102091_5"]="You're right.",
  ["100102091_6"]="If we can find a reasonable soldier or an Eme-an of this era, perhaps they will tell us what has happened here.",
  ["100102091_7"]="Let's go. We don't have much time.",
  ["100102092_1"]="The only surviving soldier's eyes are unfocused. His stance looks unsteady, and his weapon, pointed at us, is shaking.",
  ["100102092_10"]="How long ago was that? One year? Or two years? I can't remember clearly.",
  ["100102092_11"]="This is not a library. It's an endless nightmare. Ever since I got here, I've been praying for the gods to wake me up from this living hell.",
  ["100102092_12"]="Take over? You barged into the Library? No wonder. It's actually impressive that you've held on for so long without any preparation.",
  ["100102092_13"]="Why did your emperor send you here to die?",
  ["100102092_14"]="Our mission is to uncover the truth about the God of the Sun in Memphis.",
  ["100102092_15"]="His Majesty has given the Eme-an years, and yet there have been no results. Eventually, he ran out of patience.",
  ["100102092_16"]="Personally, I don't have anything against you.",
  ["100102092_17"]="We're puzzled, too. It's hard to understand why His Majesty, who's always been a profound thinker, would act that way.",
  ["100102092_18"]="Eme-an... I know it may sound brazen, especially after we barged into your tower, but I'm asking you to take me back to His Majesty.",
  ["100102092_19"]="The Immortal Army shall never fail His Majesty...",
  ["100102092_2"]="Please lower your weapons. We mean no harm.",
  ["100102092_20"]="What a coincidence. We're actually searching for your emperor as well.",
  ["100102092_21"]="How about you join us? With you on our side, he might be more open to hearing us out, don't you think?",
  ["100102092_3"]="Wh-who are you?",
  ["100102092_4"]="We are Eme-ans.",
  ["100102092_5"]="My... my name is Farhad. I... I can't see you well. I thought you were monsters, too.",
  ["100102092_6"]="Thank you so much. I didn't expect your help, especially after His Majesty gave that order.",
  ["100102092_7"]="His Majesty? Are you talking about Emperor Darius?",
  ["100102092_8"]="Of course. Were you not there when His Majesty gave the order?",
  ["100102092_9"]="His Majesty ordered the Immortal Army to take over the Tower of Babel and the Library of Babel.",
  ["1001021"]="Azi",
  ["100102101_1"]="The King of All Kings",
  ["100102101_2"]="So, what does your emperor want to uncover about the God of the Sun?",
  ["100102101_3"]="Even though the emperor's brilliance can rival the sun itself, he can't accept that all things eventually come to an end.",
  ["100102101_4"]="Rumor has it that the God of the Sun of Memphis is immortal. Therefore, His Majesty wishes to unravel the secret to immortality, hoping to find methods that will grant him immortality.",
  ["100102101_5"]="In this vast library, there must be a scroll or something that holds the key to harnessing the power of the God of the Sun. His Majesty's goal is to conquer distant stars, and we, the Immortal Army, must find that divine scroll.",
  ["100102102_1"]="Why are you looking so exhausted, General Farhad? What happened to you?",
  ["100102102_10"]="But after taking only a few steps, Farhad falls to his knees.",
  ["100102102_100"]="Listen well. I sent my people to collect many ancient documents and summoned many scholars while I was in Memphis.",
  ["100102102_101"]="But the destruction of Ehtaton was so complete that very little information survived.",
  ["100102102_102"]="Despite my efforts, I only figured out one piece of information from the ancient records. \"The language of the gods is a palindrome.\"",
  ["100102102_103"]="The language of the gods is a palindrome? What does that mean?",
  ["100102102_104"]="Legend has it that Akhenaten deciphered the language of the gods and thus learned how to harness the sun.",
  ["100102102_105"]="The language consists a huge number of palindromic words. While they are written exactly the same forwards and backwards, they cause the God of the Sun to perform very different behaviors.",
  ["100102102_106"]="That's all I know. I didn't have access to the vocabulary.",
  ["100102102_107"]="As soon as I returned to Obed, I shared this discovery with your companions, the Eme-ans of this era.",
  ["100102102_108"]="But unfortunately, it didn't help them with the task I had assigned them.",
  ["100102102_109"]="Now, it's your turn. Tell me, have you figured out the secret to immortality?",
  ["100102102_11"]="What is... happening? Why can't I move on?",
  ["100102102_110"]="Have you found the secret, Ereshan?",
  ["100102102_111"]="With elegance, Ereshan stands up and brushes the dust from her jacket.",
  ["100102102_112"]="Her expression, usually filled with sarcasm, now shows extraordinary confidence.",
  ["100102102_113"]="Ere...",
  ["100102102_114"]="Huh? What are you talking about? The secret to immortality?",
  ["100102102_115"]="It. Does. Not. Exist!",
  ["100102102_116"]="She runs straight towards me.",
  ["100102102_117"]="What are you waiting for, Director? We've got the information! Now it's time to make a run for it!",
  ["100102102_118"]="How dare you...",
  ["100102102_12"]="Slowly, the emperor rises from his throne.",
  ["100102102_13"]="I'm so ashamed... to request that Your Majesty descend from your throne...",
  ["100102102_14"]="With measured steps, Darius approaches Farhad.",
  ["100102102_15"]="Your Majesty, please—",
  ["100102102_16"]="His words are abruptly cut off as Darius swings his sharp blade, and blood sprays out in a crimson arc.",
  ["100102102_17"]="!",
  ["100102102_18"]="With a quick flick of his blade, Darius steps over the body and walks towards us.",
  ["100102102_19"]="He never looked at the face of the soldier, as though what he just slaughtered was nothing more than a worthless lamb.",
  ["100102102_2"]="What did you do to him?!",
  ["100102102_20"]="...",
  ["100102102_21"]="(Remain silent.)",
  ["100102102_22"]="How can you just...?!",
  ["100102102_23"]="Shut up.",
  ["100102102_24"]="Ereshan softly scolds me, while Zero puts her hand on my shoulder and shakes her head.",
  ["100102102_25"]="You're in no position to tell me how to punish my soldiers, outsider. Those who have failed me are no different from deserters, and this is what happens to deserters.",
  ["100102102_26"]="Darius turns to the man next to him.",
  ["100102102_27"]="Pythagoras, are they your companions?",
  ["100102102_28"]="No, Your Majesty. Although their clothes resemble mine, I've never seen them before.",
  ["100102102_29"]="We're not Eme-ans from this world.",
  ["100102102_3"]="Behave yourselves. If it weren't for these Eme-ans, I would have died long ago on the nameless land.",
  ["100102102_30"]="We come from the future, two and a half thousand years from now.",
  ["100102102_31"]="Ha.",
  ["100102102_32"]="A funny joke. Unfortunately, it comes at an inopportune moment.",
  ["100102102_33"]="Those who dare to mock me must be punished.",
  ["100102102_34"]="Please wait, Your Majesty. The wonders of the Library of Babel surpass the wildest imagination of mortals.",
  ["100102102_35"]="Here, it is possible to encounter someone from a past or future era...",
  ["100102102_36"]="For the sake of your lives, strangers, if you too are Eme-ans like me, show your proof.",
  ["100102102_37"]="Zero, that thing...",
  ["100102102_38"]="Zero nods at me and takes out the fragment.",
  ["100102102_39"]="This is a fragment from your crown.",
  ["100102102_4"]="I'll inform His Majesty of your achievements, Eme-an.",
  ["100102102_40"]="Indeed, it is.",
  ["100102102_41"]="Where did you get this weathered fragment from?",
  ["100102102_42"]="From two and a half thousand years in the future. By then, it had become an antique.",
  ["100102102_43"]="Interesting. Let's assume what you said is true.",
  ["100102102_44"]="Answer me this: who rules over Obed two and a half thousand years from now?",
  ["100102102_45"]="I can't answer your question because Obed has no need for a ruler that far in the future.",
  ["100102102_46"]="I see. You can't provide me with what I desire either.",
  ["100102102_47"]="Lead the way forward, Pythagoras. As for these useless freeloaders... Get rid of them, my soldiers.",
  ["100102102_48"]="Darius turns around as the Immortal Army soldiers spread out, forming a semi-circle and slowly advancing.",
  ["100102102_49"]="Ere.",
  ["100102102_5"]="Soon, you'll see that Farhad always keeps his promises, and His Majesty is a generous and benevolent ruler.",
  ["100102102_50"]="Ereshan sighs, undeterred by the spearheads of the Immortal Army soldiers, walks up to Darius, and bows to him.",
  ["100102102_51"]="Your Majesty, please forgive our rudeness.",
  ["100102102_52"]="...",
  ["100102102_53"]="(What? Is this really Ereshan?!)",
  ["100102102_54"]="...",
  ["100102102_55"]="You know your manners, but your courtesy comes too late.",
  ["100102102_56"]="It's true that Obed won't need a ruler in the future...",
  ["100102102_57"]="Because by that time, Obed will be insignificant compared to your vast empire! We don't need anyone specifically to rule over it!",
  ["100102102_58"]="The fragment you just saw is a gift you gave us yourself!",
  ["100102102_59"]="Upon hearing her reply, Darius stops.",
  ["100102102_6"]="Let us assist you.",
  ["100102102_60"]="You mean, you've seen me two and a half thousand years later?",
  ["100102102_61"]="Did I still rule over my vast empire?",
  ["100102102_62"]="Yeah, of course.",
  ["100102102_63"]="How did I survive until then in the future? Tell me! Now!",
  ["100102102_64"]="Gladly, but... we want something in return.",
  ["100102102_65"]="Darius sneers, looking down upon Ereshan.",
  ["100102102_66"]="Even those who call themselves the \"mouthpieces of the gods\" are nothing more than mere mortals after all.",
  ["100102102_67"]="Your wish is granted. All the wealth in my treasury and all the provinces in my domain are yours for the taking.",
  ["100102102_68"]="We don't want wealth or fiefdoms. We just want to know what you know about the God of the Sun.",
  ["100102102_69"]="How interesting. That's the very same question I've been asking you Eme-ans for years.",
  ["100102102_7"]="Stand back.",
  ["100102102_70"]="But why is an Eme-an from the future asking me this question instead?",
  ["100102102_71"]="You seek the secrets of the God of the Sun because you're eager to know the secret to immortality, right?",
  ["100102102_72"]="We discovered its mysteries once.",
  ["100102102_73"]="However, over the long years since then, many details of our research have been lost.",
  ["100102102_74"]="That's why we're coming back from the future, to get the missing pieces.",
  ["100102102_75"]="You've been to Delphi during your expedition, and I believe you've heard the stories about Oedipus that go around there.",
  ["100102102_76"]="In the loop made by time, the result and the cause will become one.",
  ["100102102_77"]="You'll need to tell us everything you know about the God of the Sun, so that we'll be able to get you the full answer.",
  ["100102102_78"]="That's the only way we can help you survive the next two and a half thousand years.",
  ["100102102_79"]="In the distant future, you gifted us the token so that we could return here to figure out the truth about immortality.",
  ["100102102_8"]="Heh, no need. I've witnessed the distant and boundless lands with His Majesty when you were just babies.",
  ["100102102_80"]="...",
  ["100102102_81"]="Nothing but lies.",
  ["100102102_82"]="Myths are for ignorant children. Do you think I'm as gullible as a child?",
  ["100102102_83"]="I've found ludicrous loopholes in your words. Since the me in the future already knows the secret to immortality, why didn't that me ask you to tell me the secrets directly?",
  ["100102102_84"]="Immortal Army!",
  ["100102102_85"]="In an instant, we are surrounded by sharp blades.",
  ["100102102_86"]="Those who deceive me will pay with their lives.",
  ["100102102_87"]="Ereshan remains composed.",
  ["100102102_88"]="Of course you can just kill us, Your Majesty.",
  ["100102102_89"]="But at the moment we're killed, the causal loop in the timeline will be severed.",
  ["100102102_9"]="If I need help with even a few steps, how am I supposed to follow His Majesty to the ends of the stars?",
  ["100102102_90"]="If you don't learn the secret to immorality now, you, your empire, and all the feats you will achieve in the future will simply go up in smoke.",
  ["100102102_91"]="Pythagoras raises his eyes and studies Ereshan. It seems he is about to say something, but in the end, he just shakes his head gently.",
  ["100102102_92"]="Are you threatening me, Eme-an?",
  ["100102102_93"]="Ereshan looks straight up at Darius.",
  ["100102102_94"]="No, as a scholar, I'm simply telling you what might happen because of your actions.",
  ["100102102_95"]="Whether to trust us or kill us on the spot, the choice is up to you. I'm sure you already have an answer in your mind.",
  ["100102102_96"]="...",
  ["100102102_97"]="Well, indeed. A nasty tone unique to Eme-an.",
  ["100102102_98"]="Lay down your weapons... for now.",
  ["100102102_99"]="The soldiers immediately put away their weapons.",
  ["100102111_1"]="The Last Expedition",
  ["100102111_10"]="I am Darius, the Great King of Obed! The King of All Kings!",
  ["100102111_100"]="But why does it seek the secret of immortality?",
  ["100102111_101"]="One day, we'll leave our footprints across the entire expanse of the sky!",
  ["100102111_102"]="...",
  ["100102111_103"]="It closes its eyes.",
  ["100102111_104"]="That brilliant canopy of stars, along with its steely ambitions, has long since faded.",
  ["100102111_105"]="Thus, the grandest vision has been twisted into the most grotesque desires.",
  ["100102111_106"]="The nameless tyrant finally comes to a halt.",
  ["100102111_107"]="The nameless tyrant finally comes to a halt.",
  ["100102111_108"]="How much time has elapsed since the expedition began? And how far has it traveled?",
  ["100102111_109"]="There is no way to ascertain the answer. The unit \"year\" is inadequate to measure the passage of time during this interminable journey.",
  ["100102111_11"]="I shall bestow grace upon the faithful and punish the disloyal!",
  ["100102111_110"]="Only the visage of those deceitful Eme-ans grows clearer in memory.",
  ["100102111_111"]="It must unleash its wrath and retribution upon them, making known the might and majesty of the king.",
  ["100102111_112"]="It has grown accustomed to this peculiar library.",
  ["100102111_113"]="It has traversed numerous corridors, rooms, and staircases, seamlessly blending with the library's surroundings.",
  ["100102111_114"]="Eme-an, I have come this far without your guidance.",
  ["100102111_115"]="Immortal Army, I have endured without your companionship.",
  ["100102111_116"]="Strange visions still arise, but they no longer cloud its mind.",
  ["100102111_117"]="The tyrant once saw a mirror that did not reflect its face, but instead displayed a strange and imposing figure with a cold gaze, like that of a mythical giant.",
  ["100102111_118"]="As long as it gazed into the mirror, the reflection stared back at it.",
  ["100102111_119"]="In astonishment, the tyrant realizes that it saw the very same visage reflected in a blood-stained blade long ago.",
  ["100102111_12"]="He discards the blade in his hand and raises his scepter high once more.",
  ["100102111_120"]="No words are spoken, and the reflection remains silent until the tyrant departs.",
  ["100102111_121"]="...",
  ["100102111_122"]="At times, the tyrant reminisces about the distant past, the days when it and Pythagoras were still friends.",
  ["100102111_123"]="Pythagoras shared rare pieces of knowledge with it, one of which still echoes in its mind.",
  ["100102111_124"]="Probability fears time.",
  ["100102111_125"]="Thus concludes the scene.",
  ["100102111_126"]="And so, the nameless tyrant resumes its march onward.",
  ["100102111_127"]="In the vast expanse of time, it anticipates an encounter with those who deceived it...",
  ["100102111_128"]="Awaiting a minuscule, incredibly remote, yet not impossible chance of meeting them once more.",
  ["100102111_13"]="Heed my command, my Immortal Army! Hunt down those Eme-ans!",
  ["100102111_14"]="From this place to the end of the world!",
  ["100102111_15"]="From this moment until the end of their lives or yours!",
  ["100102111_16"]="The King of All Kings and his army begin their march forward.",
  ["100102111_17"]="Finally, one day, one of the praetorians gathers up his courage and steps forward.",
  ["100102111_18"]="We have ventured too far, Your Majesty.",
  ["100102111_19"]="If we continue, we may not be able to return. The paths ahead... not even the Eme-ans have explored them.",
  ["100102111_2"]="Don't you dare run away!",
  ["100102111_20"]="Eme-ans! Eme-ans! Always those babbling Eme-ans!",
  ["100102111_21"]="Why would I, the King of All Kings, need someone else to pioneer my new territories?!",
  ["100102111_22"]="Wherever I go, it is my domain! And whatever I say, my words shall shine like the sun!",
  ["100102111_23"]="From this day on, cease all support to those Eme-ans! We don't need those false mouthpieces of the gods!",
  ["100102111_24"]="But Your Majesty, what about Pythagoras?",
  ["100102111_25"]="The King of All Kings just glances back at him.",
  ["100102111_26"]="I won't repeat myself.",
  ["100102111_27"]="Yes, Your Majesty.",
  ["100102111_28"]="The King of All Kings and his army continue their march.",
  ["100102111_29"]="The King of All Kings and his army continue their march.",
  ["100102111_3"]="How dare you deceive me?!",
  ["100102111_30"]="However, fatigue and hunger prove to be the deadliest weapons of all.",
  ["100102111_31"]="As resolute as the Immortal Army may be, silence pervades their ranks with each passing day.",
  ["100102111_32"]="Their voices diminish, and their numbers wane.",
  ["100102111_33"]="Yet Darius remains unwavering.",
  ["100102111_34"]="Unaware of the distance traveled, they unexpectedly encounter another group of seekers.",
  ["100102111_35"]="You are...!",
  ["100102111_36"]="Wait... please spare us... I beg you...",
  ["100102111_37"]="Such things happen occasionally, to the detriment of honor, but this cannot be helped.",
  ["100102111_38"]="Take away their supplies. Spare the strong and destroy the old and the weak.",
  ["100102111_39"]="What is happening? Why do you defy my orders?",
  ["100102111_4"]="Your Majesty! Please calm down!",
  ["100102111_40"]="Have you forgotten what happened when we crossed the Memphis Desert? If we hadn't plundered the caravan, it wouldn't have been us celebrating under the magnificent waterfalls of the Memphis River.",
  ["100102111_41"]="Carry on. We have a long path ahead, and we must not stumble here.",
  ["100102111_42"]="Yes... Your Majesty.",
  ["100102111_43"]="The King of All Kings is marching forward relentlessly.",
  ["100102111_44"]="The King of All Kings is marching forward relentlessly.",
  ["100102111_45"]="This is yet another expedition.",
  ["100102111_46"]="No different from all the expeditions before.",
  ["100102111_47"]="Equally long, equally solitary, and equally grueling.",
  ["100102111_48"]="However, Darius remains certain that he will ultimately reach his goal and emerge triumphant.",
  ["100102111_49"]="For the Immortal Army journeys alongside him, their loyalty as steadfast as ever.",
  ["100102111_5"]="Your Majesty...",
  ["100102111_50"]="Let's station ourselves here today.",
  ["100102111_51"]="Looks like we're running low on food.",
  ["100102111_52"]="Soldiers, kill my horse.",
  ["100102111_53"]="What's the meaning of this? Why the hesitation?",
  ["100102111_54"]="Have you forgotten what happened when we attacked Delphi the first time? At that time, I slaughtered my horse so that we could cross frigid Mount Metikas.",
  ["100102111_55"]="This is no different. Come, I shall share the horse's flesh with all of you once more.",
  ["100102111_56"]="But why?",
  ["100102111_57"]="Why is he the only one willing to consume the meat in his hand?",
  ["100102111_58"]="My warriors...",
  ["100102111_59"]="My warriors?",
  ["100102111_6"]="The shouts of the praetorians become distant.",
  ["100102111_60"]="Darius continues to march forward.",
  ["100102111_61"]="Darius continues to march forward.",
  ["100102111_62"]="The Eme-ans remain elusive, but he is certain they are hiding nearby.",
  ["100102111_63"]="Darius acknowledges that his days are limited. Even his most loyal praetorians speculate on how much longer their emperor can endure.",
  ["100102111_64"]="It has been a considerable amount of time since they last spoke to him, yet he senses his soldiers whispering, suspecting that one day he might suddenly collapse and never wake up.",
  ["100102111_65"]="What a ridiculous speculation. Darius no longer looks backward, for there is nothing but feeble doubts and apprehension left. His followers no longer warrant his attention.",
  ["100102111_66"]="He will prevail, just as he has in every war thus far.",
  ["100102111_67"]="He will endure until the very end of the world.",
  ["100102111_68"]="Halt here.",
  ["100102111_69"]="We need a break once in a while. I grant you a brief reprieve.",
  ["100102111_7"]="Darius gazes down as blood flows around his feet, stemming from the blade in his hand.",
  ["100102111_70"]="Hmm... These books on the shelves are unlike any I've seen before.",
  ["100102111_71"]="The glyphs on the pages are unfamiliar, distinct from those used in Obed.",
  ["100102111_72"]="They differ from the languages of all the peoples he has encountered during his conquests.",
  ["100102111_73"]="No matter. One day, I will conquer their lands.",
  ["100102111_74"]="Remember what I said, Farhad? I shall share my glory and dreams with you...",
  ["100102111_75"]="Armor me, Farhad, my most loyal friend. Let's embark on our odyssey.",
  ["100102111_76"]="Our expedition must not stop here...",
  ["100102111_77"]="...",
  ["100102111_78"]="Farhad?",
  ["100102111_79"]="If you choose not to accompany me on this quest, it's alright. I permit you to turn back and return home.",
  ["100102111_8"]="The shiny, mirror-like blade reflects a familiar stranger back at him.",
  ["100102111_80"]="It is a king's duty to forge ahead. As my subject, your duty is to spread news of my accomplishments throughout the world.",
  ["100102111_81"]="Go back, Farhad.",
  ["100102111_82"]="Whether in life or in death, you shall forever be showered in my grace.",
  ["100102111_83"]="In a trance.",
  ["100102111_84"]="Darius hears a faint sigh.",
  ["100102111_85"]="Farhad...",
  ["100102111_86"]="The nameless tyrant continues to march forward.",
  ["100102111_87"]="The nameless tyrant continues to march forward.",
  ["100102111_88"]="It knows with certainty that many have vanished along the way.",
  ["100102111_89"]="It no longer calls out to its praetorians, for doing so is futile. It cares not where those cowards have fled.",
  ["100102111_9"]="Darius fixates on the reflection for a prolonged moment before exhaling deeply. His voice regains composure, though an underlying madness remains.",
  ["100102111_90"]="If the king's path is too arduous for mortals, then the king shall proceed alone to the end.",
  ["100102111_91"]="Having pillaged traders, slain its horse, and utilized all available resources along its path, the nameless tyrant marches forward on its unending journey.",
  ["100102111_92"]="Even in its resolute state, it occasionally experiences hallucinations.",
  ["100102111_93"]="It feels as though a part of itself is dissipating, transforming into something else.",
  ["100102111_94"]="Such is a sign of dehydration, an ordeal it endured during a sea voyage across the Philistine Sea. Back then, it and its army were lost in a storm, and all the fresh water had been consumed.",
  ["100102111_95"]="How did it and its army escape death?",
  ["100102111_96"]="It can no longer recall.",
  ["100102111_97"]="The only thing that remains within its soul is the desire to press onward.",
  ["100102111_98"]="But why must it continue to march forward?",
  ["100102111_99"]="Oh, right. It wants to find the secret to immortality. It wants to become immorality itself. And it wants to take revenge on certain Eme-ans who have deceived it...",
  ["100102121_1"]="Returning to 2,000 Years Ago",
  ["100102121_10"]="I think I've figured out why we've been entangled with Darius.",
  ["100102121_11"]="Now I'm certain that the giant we encountered when we first entered the Library, and the one we saw during our second meeting with Sarvis, are one and the same, Seer.",
  ["100102121_12"]="It is... Darius.",
  ["100102121_13"]="But wait, Darius is a human, right?",
  ["100102121_14"]="That thing doesn't resemble a human in any way.",
  ["100102121_15"]="Zero closes her eyes.",
  ["100102121_16"]="This Library is alive and has its own wisdom.",
  ["100102121_17"]="That's what Elish, the first director of the Library, once said.",
  ["100102121_18"]="Therefore, visitors should stay quiet, humble, and cautious within the Library.",
  ["100102121_19"]="It is not recommended to speak, write, or daydream, for words and ideas carry power.",
  ["100102121_2"]="Circa 2,000 years before World Calendar",
  ["100102121_20"]="The Library is an Anomaly, after all.",
  ["100102121_21"]="It may give incredible responses to obsessive thoughts...",
  ["100102121_22"]="The echoes of Darius' shouts reverberate in my ears once again.",
  ["100102121_23"]="Don't you dare run away!",
  ["100102121_24"]="How dare you deceive me?!",
  ["100102121_25"]="In addition to anger, there was unrestrained fear and despair in his voice.",
  ["100102121_26"]="It is as if a man is grasping at the last straw, only to find that it is turning into dust.",
  ["100102121_27"]="We deceived a man of extraordinary strength of willpower.",
  ["100102121_28"]="Obsessive ideas may stir up billowing waves in this ocean of thoughts.",
  ["100102121_29"]="So, you're saying that the Library distorted Darius, turning him into the giant that has been chasing us around?",
  ["100102121_3"]="Darius' furious roars swiftly dissipate, fading into faint ripples in the river of time.",
  ["100102121_30"]="If that's the case, it explains why he hated our guts so much.",
  ["100102121_31"]="After all, we shattered his world with that devastating lie.",
  ["100102121_32"]="Hold on a sec.",
  ["100102121_33"]="So, we lied to Darius, and after he got distorted by the Library, he stayed here for all those thousands of years just to get revenge against us?",
  ["100102121_34"]="According to our time machine, you met the giant before you met me.",
  ["100102121_35"]="Thanks to him, our time machine met the future me and heard the prophecy.",
  ["100102121_36"]="And that's how we started this totally messed-up journey, right?",
  ["100102121_37"]="Heh, how ironic.",
  ["100102121_38"]="We went to Darius because we had already met him.",
  ["100102121_39"]="Cause and effect become one in the Library of Babel.",
  ["100102121_4"]="As the ripples disperse, tranquility is restored to the surroundings.",
  ["100102121_40"]="It's a loop.",
  ["100102121_41"]="...",
  ["100102121_42"]="Why are you giving me that look?",
  ["100102121_43"]="No, it's nothing.",
  ["100102121_44"]="Just don't leave my sight without my permission, Ere.",
  ["100102121_45"]="What are you talking about? That's a weird thing to say. Quit using that tone with me.",
  ["100102121_46"]="...",
  ["100102121_47"]="Looking at Ereshan's disgusted face, I understand why Zero suddenly became silent.",
  ["100102121_48"]="From the beginning, we have been faithfully following the directions of destiny, like cogs in a well-oiled machine.",
  ["100102121_49"]="Whether it is searching for Tasny, arriving in the era of the fifth emperor, or going in search of Darius, everything seems predestined.",
  ["100102121_5"]="Zero quickly examines volumes of literature on a nearby bookshelf.",
  ["100102121_50"]="So, if this journey continues...",
  ["100102121_51"]="Will Ereshan die under Aten's blazing radiance just like I foresaw?",
  ["100102121_52"]="Once again, the image of her dissolving within the radiance comes unbidden to my mind.",
  ["100102121_53"]="Ere...",
  ["100102121_54"]="Shut up.",
  ["100102121_55"]="Hey, what's with that look on your face?",
  ["100102121_56"]="Stop it. It's making me sick.",
  ["100102121_57"]="I'm not going to follow this so-called prophecy.",
  ["100102121_58"]="But with the current situation, we have to continue this loop.",
  ["100102121_59"]="Remember, the fate of two eras rests on our shoulders.",
  ["100102121_6"]="This is Sarvis' era.",
  ["100102121_60"]="Next, if our time machine gets things right, we should be at a point between our two encounters with Sarvis.",
  ["100102121_61"]="We must inform him about the divine words at this point.",
  ["100102121_62"]="Since someone in this era activated Aten, the divine words must exist in this era. If he can find the person who activated Aten, he'll naturally get the command to stop it.",
  ["100102121_63"]="If everything goes smoothly, we'll put a stop to Aten... no, the Star of Ephrathah... before it burns everything in this era to ashes.",
  ["100102121_64"]="You do have a kind soul.",
  ["100102121_65"]="I didn't expect you to be so responsible.",
  ["100102121_66"]="Huh? Try saying that again!",
  ["100102121_67"]="Don't you dare spout any more nonsense like that!",
  ["100102121_68"]="Our banter sweeps away the tense atmosphere.",
  ["100102121_69"]="However, I have a vague feeling that something is wrong.",
  ["100102121_7"]="...",
  ["100102121_70"]="If everything is a part of this loop...",
  ["100102121_71"]="Who actually activates Aten in the future?",
  ["100102121_72"]="Why was it only Ereshan facing Aten in the future?",
  ["100102121_73"]="Why weren't Zero and I there with Ereshan in the future?",
  ["100102121_74"]="Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to find the answers.",
  ["100102121_75"]="Someone's coming.",
  ["100102121_8"]="Something seems to be on your mind.",
  ["100102121_9"]="That \"I've really got something to say\" look on your face is pretty rare.",
  ["100102131_1"]="We're entering the Unknown Sector.",
  ["100102131_2"]="Finding someone in the Unknown Sector... This is simply a living nightmare.",
  ["100102131_3"]="Let's hope that general didn't go too deep.",
  ["100102132_1"]="Allow me to get straight to the point: do you happen to know how to deactivate the God of the Sun?",
  ["100102141_1"]="The Three Kings",
  ["100102141_10"]="They didn't think about the catastrophic consequences it would bring.",
  ["100102141_11"]="Unfortunately, Herod killed all those slaves once he obtained the divine words, so nobody else could ascend to the divine throne like him.",
  ["100102141_12"]="By the time we arrived, the copper sphere was already levitating and burning over Herod's capital city Ephrathah. We apprehended Herod before the city was razed to the ground.",
  ["100102141_13"]="However, he only knows how to activate the sphere, and he didn't ask for the command to deactivate it. Now, with the death of the last of the Memphian priests, the secrets are lost forever.",
  ["100102141_14"]="If that copper sphere continues to burn, one day the Philistine Sea will dry up, and even Javriel, the Eternal City, will end up in flames...",
  ["100102141_15"]="Sarvis gives me a pleading look.",
  ["100102141_16"]="Fortunately, I had met you in the Library of Babel.",
  ["100102141_17"]="I remembered you had mentioned that the copper sphere could be deactivated.",
  ["100102141_18"]="So we rushed back here to seek your help.",
  ["100102141_19"]="Such is the situation. If you know how to stop this world from ending up in flames, I'm willing to offer whatever I can in return.",
  ["100102141_2"]="Did someone activate that sphere?",
  ["100102141_20"]="He kneels before me, head bowed.",
  ["100102141_21"]="Hold on a second.",
  ["100102141_22"]="We don't need any payment.",
  ["100102141_23"]="That's exactly why we're here.",
  ["100102141_24"]="Hey, hold on...",
  ["100102141_25"]="The language of the gods is a palindrome.",
  ["100102141_26"]="While they are written exactly the same forwards and backwards...",
  ["100102141_27"]="They cause the God of the Sun to perform very different behaviors.",
  ["100102141_28"]="You've told him already?!",
  ["100102141_29"]="The language of the gods is a palindrome...",
  ["100102141_3"]="I'm afraid so. According to our plan, we delivered it to the Philistine Sea to get it loaded on a ship and then transfer it to Javriel.",
  ["100102141_30"]="Sarvis closes his eyes, ponders for a moment, then opens them again.",
  ["100102141_31"]="I understand. That'll do.",
  ["100102141_32"]="Write the palindrome words in both directions, and the quill will go back to where it started.",
  ["100102141_33"]="In other words, the command to activate the sphere is also the command to deactivate it.",
  ["100102141_34"]="We just need to repeat the same word Herod used, and it will revert to its previous state.",
  ["100102141_35"]="I can't believe this answer is so straightforward. I must return to Ephrathah immediately.",
  ["100102141_36"]="But the thing is... we've lost a significant number of solders since entering the Library of Babel.",
  ["100102141_37"]="I'm sorry, Eme-an, but I need your assistance once again. Could you escort me out of here?",
  ["100102141_4"]="However, it passed through one of our vassal states on its back way back. To my astonishment, the ruler there, Herod, had the audacity to lay his finger on it.",
  ["100102141_5"]="It was only afterward that we learned that quite a few servants in Herod's kingdom had been exiled from Memphis, and some of them had even served as priests in Memphis.",
  ["100102141_6"]="They knew a number of secrets that had been passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth. Not even Lord Thurinus or Emperor Darius had learned about them when they conquered Memphis.",
  ["100102141_7"]="Those Memphians stirred up Herod's greed, making him believe that he could awaken the God of the Sun like the ancient Pharaoh Akhenaten did and thus be elevated to the status of a god...",
  ["100102141_8"]="How ridiculous.",
  ["100102141_9"]="Yeah, it's ridiculous. Truth is, the Memphian slaves hate him for his brutality and wanted to use this chance to take revenge.",
  ["100102142_1"]="Finally, ahead is the sector I entered from. \"One must exit from where they entered.\" Such is the wise words from the Eme-ans who guided me here.",
  ["100102142_10"]="Thank you for your generosity. I'll never forget it.",
  ["100102142_11"]="Base of the Tower of Babel",
  ["100102142_12"]="Please rest assured, Your Highness. Sarvis is one of the few generals who possesses both wisdom and bravery. He will be safe.",
  ["100102142_13"]="But he's been inside all night.",
  ["100102142_14"]="I know it's prudent for us to stay out here, but...",
  ["100102142_15"]="You've witnessed the enigmatic library yourself, as well as its labyrinth plucked from myths.",
  ["100102142_16"]="Will Sarvis return safe and sound this time?",
  ["100102142_17"]="Your Highness... High Priest...",
  ["100102142_18"]="Sarvis! You're back!",
  ["100102142_19"]="Yes, and I bring good tidings.",
  ["100102142_2"]="Thank you for escorting me here.",
  ["100102142_20"]="I've found the peculiar Eme-an I mentioned last time, and they instructed me how to deactivate the God of the Sun.",
  ["100102142_21"]="Excellent. This library truly holds the answers to all questions in the world.",
  ["100102142_22"]="The three of them face west.",
  ["100102142_23"]="As dawn approaches, the Tower of Babel casts a long shadow across the land, stretching to the other side of the world.",
  ["100102142_24"]="However, the sun, still cloaked in its sanguine hues, is not the cause of the shadow.",
  ["100102142_25"]="A solitary star emanates blinding light, causing the night to retreat and its surrounding clouds to swirl tumultuously.",
  ["100102142_26"]="In a distant future, humanity will remember this star that briefly illuminated history as \"Ephrathah.\"",
  ["100102142_27"]="Its radiance at this moment would mark the beginning of another legend.",
  ["100102142_28"]="High Priest Merari, do you still have a copy of the treaty with the Arsacid Empire?",
  ["100102142_29"]="I can have the scribe immediately draft a new one, Your Highness.",
  ["100102142_3"]="Hey, Mr. General.",
  ["100102142_30"]="What do you mean, Your Highness?",
  ["100102142_31"]="I will sign it. Tell our soldiers that we are no longer at war with Obed.",
  ["100102142_32"]="Let's go back. Once we resolve the issue in Ephrathah, we will make our way back home.",
  ["100102142_33"]="May I ask the reason behind your change of heart, Your Highness?",
  ["100102142_34"]="Look at that burning star. If there's anything like divine revelation in the world, it probably looks like that, wouldn't you agree?",
  ["100102142_35"]="We... No, Japheth is not ready to confront such power.",
  ["100102142_36"]="My father has been invincible throughout his life. He forged his great empire in his thirties. I heard that he was frustrated at the thought of spending the remainder of his days governing rather than conquering.",
  ["100102142_37"]="However, I think governing is far more challenging than conquering. I've always worried that if Japheth armies keep crossing new frontiers, sooner or later, they'll meet an impenetrable presence.",
  ["100102142_38"]="Father has never tasted defeat, and neither has Japheth.",
  ["100102142_39"]="Father is aged, and Japheth has long grown accustomed to the countless triumphs he has achieved.",
  ["100102142_4"]="Although we didn't request payment, it's okay to ask for a favor, right?",
  ["100102142_40"]="If, one day, Japheth fails to sustain its momentum of conquest...",
  ["100102142_41"]="If, one day, the tip of Japheth's spear finally shatters against a towering wall never before encountered...",
  ["100102142_42"]="How do you think the people of Japheth would feel in such a moment?",
  ["100102142_43"]="Pride renders one fragile, and when it breaks, it shatters the heart into pieces.",
  ["100102142_44"]="Now, seeing that newborn star, I think we've reached the towering wall that casts its shadow over Japheth.",
  ["100102142_45"]="Undoubtedly, there are forces in this world that surpass the limits of human imagination. This library, capable of harnessing even the power of that star, lies far beyond our dominion.",
  ["100102142_46"]="We are not yet prepared to venture into the realm of gods.",
  ["100102142_47"]="I concur, Your Highness.",
  ["100102142_48"]="It is time to head back. Since Eme-an has guarded this power for so long, let it be.",
  ["100102142_49"]="There must be reasons why this tower has stood undisturbed for thousands of years.",
  ["100102142_5"]="Of course. Just let me know whatever you want.",
  ["100102142_50"]="Until we understand those reasons, we must not disturb the balance.",
  ["100102142_51"]="No, we shouldn't even touch it.",
  ["100102142_52"]="It'd be for the best if all of us stayed away from it, neither to inquire nor to disturb it, lest it bring a catastrophe down upon us.",
  ["100102142_53"]="While my words may appear disrespectful, His Majesty's order to retrieve the God of the Sun and the situation we are facing serve as compelling evidence.",
  ["100102142_54"]="I agree with your decision to retreat, Your Highness.",
  ["100102142_55"]="However, if we ignore the blaze of the star and the impending destruction it brings, it is... beautiful, like a real celestial body.",
  ["100102142_56"]="Now we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that someone, or some being, crafted it.",
  ["100102142_57"]="How extraordinary it is to craft a star?",
  ["100102142_58"]="If I had the chance, I would love to see the hands that forged the star...",
  ["100102142_59"]="Sarvis lets out a long sigh.",
  ["100102142_6"]="Well, when you go back and see Herod again, please make a copy of the divine words he tells you and give it to us.",
  ["100102142_60"]="Even if I am unable to witness it, I hope that my descendants will be blessed with this fortune...",
  ["100102142_61"]="Time to go. We have no time for sentimentality.",
  ["100102142_62"]="Leave the recording of history to poets and scholars.",
  ["100102142_63"]="As for us, let us restore the sky with its true sun.",
  ["100102142_7"]="Sarvis pauses for a moment, then nods.",
  ["100102142_8"]="Sure thing. That's a simple task.",
  ["100102142_9"]="Once I resolve the troubles in Ephrathah, I'll come back and deliver the letter for you.",
  ["100102151_1"]="Lord of Blossoms",
  ["100102151_10"]="For some reason, this information fills me with unease.",
  ["100102151_100"]="Hmm...",
  ["100102151_101"]="Thank you?",
  ["100102151_102"]="You do have a kind soul.",
  ["100102151_103"]="I, Sarvis, swear by my domain, Bellefontaine, the City of Blossoms.",
  ["100102151_104"]="I, my family, and my descendants... we will always remember this oath.",
  ["100102151_105"]="He lifts his head, his violet eyes lock onto mine, unwavering.",
  ["100102151_106"]="From now to eternity.",
  ["100102151_107"]="Sarvis departs with his army without another word.",
  ["100102151_108"]="He's a pretty honorable man.",
  ["100102151_109"]="Zero, who has remained silent all this time, thoughtfully repeats the name that Sarvis mentioned.",
  ["100102151_11"]="A sense of foreboding grows in my mind.",
  ["100102151_110"]="Bellefontaine... Sarvis...",
  ["100102151_111"]="She closes her eyes.",
  ["100102151_112"]="So, he is the first leader of Florentine, Sarvis Florentine.",
  ["100102151_113"]="...",
  ["100102151_114"]="I see. Our initial connection with Florentine was actually because of you.",
  ["100102151_115"]="What do you mean?",
  ["100102151_116"]="Florentine?",
  ["100102151_117"]="Sometimes I wonder where you've been all these years.",
  ["100102151_118"]="You don't even know about the Florentine Bank, which basically controls half the continent's economy?",
  ["100102151_119"]="Now's not the perfect time to explain everything about Florentine.",
  ["100102151_12"]="Who actually activated Aten in the future?",
  ["100102151_120"]="Ere, show me the parchment that Sarvis just gave you.",
  ["100102151_121"]="Hah, what's the rush? Worried about losing it? I've already written it down anyway.",
  ["100102151_122"]="Ereshan snorts, slowly retrieving the paper Sarvis gave her from her pocket.",
  ["100102151_123"]="What's written on it?",
  ["100102151_124"]="Ereshan gives no answer.",
  ["100102151_125"]="Instead, she simply lets out a soft sigh.",
  ["100102151_126"]="Zero, you know what?",
  ["100102151_127"]="...",
  ["100102151_128"]="I'm really grateful that you're the one who's been with me on this journey...",
  ["100102151_129"]="Ereshan closes her eyes.",
  ["100102151_13"]="Who else knows the divine words besides us?",
  ["100102151_130"]="In that moment, she, though by my side, suddenly feels distant.",
  ["100102151_131"]="I can't help but reach my hand out towards her.",
  ["100102151_132"]="And you too, the candid Seer, sometimes to the point of being foolish.",
  ["100102151_133"]="An ice-cold smile curls her lips.",
  ["100102151_134"]="I'm glad I have you as my partners.",
  ["100102151_135"]="That's why my plan...",
  ["100102151_136"]="Went so smoothly.",
  ["100102151_14"]="There's no point in thinking about that now.",
  ["100102151_15"]="In an unusual display of persuasion, Ereshan sets aside her sarcasm.",
  ["100102151_16"]="This world has seen its fair share of ancient mysteries that have been passed down to the present, only to be used by people with ill intentions.",
  ["100102151_17"]="Even if someone is trying to activate Aten, we now know how to deactivate it. That's all that matters.",
  ["100102151_18"]="Ereshan's words carry a comforting aura.",
  ["100102151_19"]="Somehow, her words dispel my doubts like an enchantment.",
  ["100102151_2"]="Sarvis is gone.",
  ["100102151_20"]="I find my mind drifting into a state of trance.",
  ["100102151_21"]="...",
  ["100102151_22"]="In the flickering candlelight, Zero narrows her eyes slightly.",
  ["100102151_23"]="Besides us, the only ones who know the secrets of anomalies and might intend to use them are Nemesis.",
  ["100102151_24"]="Ere, you said you ran into them during your retrieval of Aten, right?",
  ["100102151_25"]="...",
  ["100102151_26"]="Exactly, that's why I was wary of [BBNAME].",
  ["100102151_27"]="What exactly is \"Nemesis\"?",
  ["100102151_28"]="...",
  ["100102151_29"]="All deeds have consequences. All debts must be paid.",
  ["100102151_3"]="Now this farce can finally come to an end.",
  ["100102151_30"]="Sounds rather intimidating.",
  ["100102151_31"]="Sounds like something a brooding teenager would say.",
  ["100102151_32"]="That's their motto.",
  ["100102151_33"]="Hmm, how can I give you a brief explanation?",
  ["100102151_34"]="To put it simply... Oh! Here's the perfect example.",
  ["100102151_35"]="Do you think something like Aten should be known to the world?",
  ["100102151_36"]="These artifacts possess the power of easily obliterating an entire civilization.",
  ["100102151_37"]="You've witnessed the destruction of Ehtaton and the war between Japheth and Obed. It merely revealed a fraction of its existence, and that was enough to change the course of the world.",
  ["100102151_38"]="Countless people were frantically seeking it, whether it was for immortality, overthrowing another dynasty, or simply catching a glimpse of its eternal glory.",
  ["100102151_39"]="Even in this era, where human intelligence supposedly reigns supreme, we no longer worship the God of the Sun. Do you think a nuclear fusion reactor should be revealed to the people of this era?",
  ["100102151_4"]="Once we return to the time sector where we met Sarvis for the second time, we'll learn the divine words to stop Aten.",
  ["100102151_40"]="Will it bring about an energy revolution or just another war?",
  ["100102151_41"]="Humans of every era believe their intelligence to be superior, yet they fall prey to the same mistakes time and time again.",
  ["100102151_42"]="The power of the unknown is a sweet poison. Now you're well aware of that, right?",
  ["100102151_43"]="...",
  ["100102151_44"]="That's why we've decided to hide its existence from the world.",
  ["100102151_45"]="To safeguard them from any intrusion or exploitation. Let it fade away, until its very existence falls into oblivion.",
  ["100102151_46"]="That's the philosophy of us Eme-an and the philosophy of C.A.V.E.",
  ["100102151_47"]="C.A.V.E.?",
  ["100102151_48"]="Eme-an is merely the secret society watching over Obed. There are other organizations that share our ideals.",
  ["100102151_49"]="For example, Florentine in Japheth, WeiShi in Qian, and Delphic Oracle in Delphi...",
  ["100102151_5"]="What are you waiting for, time machine? Activate your magical time-travel ability, alright?",
  ["100102151_50"]="Well, we don't have time to delve into all of this now. Once we leave here, you'll be formally introduced to the rest of the alliance as the new director of Eme-an, and you'll learn who they are for yourself.",
  ["100102151_51"]="Speaking of that, we need to mention another group of people.",
  ["100102151_52"]="Not everyone shares the same attitude on such matters.",
  ["100102151_53"]="There's another group. Well, they're not all a bunch of bad guys, but their philosophy differs from ours.",
  ["100102151_54"]="While some people want to stow away unknown power, others want to exploit it. Nemesis belongs to the latter.",
  ["100102151_55"]="They see it as something that can propel human civilization forward by hundreds of years if thoroughly studied, and they see no reason to set it aside instead of utilizing it.",
  ["100102151_56"]="As for how such actions may affect a society, they don't care at all.",
  ["100102151_57"]="I understand.",
  ["100102151_58"]="Simply put, they're another bunch of charlatans who don't see eye to eye with you.",
  ["100102151_59"]="You're really picking up information faster now.",
  ["100102151_6"]="...",
  ["100102151_60"]="Your summaries are on point. I'm impressed.",
  ["100102151_61"]="But have you forgotten that you're part of our crew now?",
  ["100102151_62"]="With the Library of Babel open, we Eme-an have no means of stopping outsiders from invading the tower.",
  ["100102151_63"]="However, if they were really to do that, they would just end up lost in an infinite ocean of information.",
  ["100102151_64"]="Zero purses her lips and looks thoughtfully at Ereshan.",
  ["100102151_65"]="If only the future version of you had provided us with more information.",
  ["100102151_66"]="Oh, what? Blaming me again?",
  ["100102151_67"]="No, I have no intention of blaming you.",
  ["100102151_68"]="Zero stares intently at Ereshan.",
  ["100102151_69"]="You're smarter and more cautious than anyone else. It wasn't your style to deliver such an ambiguous message.",
  ["100102151_7"]="I'm feeling a bit uneasy.",
  ["100102151_70"]="Ereshan hesitates for a moment, then averts her eyes.",
  ["100102151_71"]="You're giving me too much credit.",
  ["100102151_72"]="Her gaze wanders until it lands on me.",
  ["100102151_73"]="Indeed, the journey with you is full of surprises at every turn.",
  ["100102151_74"]="Ereshan looks into the distance, muttering.",
  ["100102151_75"]="Well, this trip is definitely not boring.",
  ["100102151_76"]="Quit lazing around. Let's get moving.",
  ["100102151_77"]="Two Weeks Later",
  ["100102151_78"]="The giant that fell from the sky is chasing the version of us from the past.",
  ["100102151_79"]="We land exactly where Sarvis was at that time without any deviation.",
  ["100102151_8"]="Don't you find it strange?",
  ["100102151_80"]="Although Sarvis is a bit surprised to see us appearing out of nowhere, he doesn't ask questions.",
  ["100102151_81"]="Don't you ever wonder how two groups of the same people can show up at the same time?",
  ["100102151_82"]="I've witnessed too many miracles here, and I realized what's happening here is beyond my comprehension.",
  ["100102151_83"]="He salutes us.",
  ["100102151_84"]="Nonetheless, it's a pleasure to see you again. I'm certain you're the Eme-ans who once helped us.",
  ["100102151_85"]="Once again, Sarvis takes out a parchment and presents it to us with both hands.",
  ["100102151_86"]="As promised, I've brought you a copy of the divine words.",
  ["100102151_87"]="Ereshan takes the copy casually, looks at it, and then puts it away.",
  ["100102151_88"]="Just as I am about to ask Ereshan what is written on it, Sarvis steps forward.",
  ["100102151_89"]="Please allow me to express my gratitude once again for your generosity back then.",
  ["100102151_9"]="The commands that activate and deactivate it are the same.",
  ["100102151_90"]="You're welcome.",
  ["100102151_91"]="It's not really a big deal, actually...",
  ["100102151_92"]="By saving you, we were saving ourselves.",
  ["100102151_93"]="...",
  ["100102151_94"]="Slowly, Sarvis bows towards me and rests his forehead against my hand.",
  ["100102151_95"]="...!",
  ["100102151_96"]="Although I have no idea what this gesture means in his country, I can sense his obedience and respect through this courtesy.",
  ["100102151_97"]="I understand that you Eme-ans have your own principles of conduct, and you don't want your deeds to be publicized.",
  ["100102151_98"]="But I promise you, even if the people of Japheth don't know what they've been saved from, I'll never forget your heroic deed.",
  ["100102151_99"]="I'll never forget your noble character and selflessness. If you ever find yourself in trouble in the future, I'll assist you in any way I can.",
  ["100102161_1"]="Wit's End",
  ["100102161_10"]="Heh, see? You really don't understand the feelings of an underdog like me, do you?",
  ["100102161_11"]="I am his granddaughter! I am the rightful heir to the Library!",
  ["100102161_12"]="But that day, he brought you back, and then you took everything away from me.",
  ["100102161_13"]="Are you done?",
  ["100102161_14"]="...",
  ["100102161_15"]="Stop pretending to be a sad clown. That's not who you are. What do you really want?",
  ["100102161_16"]="Upon hearing Zero's resolute voice, Ereshan freezes before bursting into laughter.",
  ["100102161_17"]="Pfft... Ha-hahahaha!",
  ["100102161_18"]="Tears well up in the corners of her eyes as she laughs.",
  ["100102161_19"]="So, that's not the answer you expected? I thought the motive of an underdog and her resentment would be perfect.",
  ["100102161_2"]="Shredded scraps of paper flutter before my eyes. I reach out, trying to grasp them, but not even a single piece lands in my hand.",
  ["100102161_20"]="Your taste is really going downhill.",
  ["100102161_21"]="I see, that explanation wasn't enough for you. So, how about this?",
  ["100102161_22"]="Ereshan sighs.",
  ["100102161_23"]="All pretenses dropped, she suddenly looks exhausted, overwhelmed.",
  ["100102161_24"]="At this moment, I realize how little I truly know about the girl who has been by my side this whole time.",
  ["100102161_25"]="I'm simply tired of it all... Eme-an, C.A.V.E., and this never-ending library.",
  ["100102161_26"]="I've wanted to destroy everything here for a long time.",
  ["100102161_27"]="...",
  ["100102161_28"]="A flicker of emotional turmoil finally appears on Zero's face.",
  ["100102161_29"]="That's why... I joined Nemesis.",
  ["100102161_3"]="Amused by my awkward response, Ereshan chuckles.",
  ["100102161_30"]="Yeah, you heard it right. I'm a spy for Nemesis.",
  ["100102161_31"]="Suddenly, the ground beneath our feet trembles.",
  ["100102161_32"]="A tremendous force is quickly approaching.",
  ["100102161_33"]="I instinctively glance behind me and notice that Darius, the giant that chased the version of us from the past, has turned back.",
  ["100102161_34"]="And it has spotted us!",
  ["100102161_35"]="Oh, perfect timing.",
  ["100102161_36"]="I'm sorry, but I'm not the type of archvillain who dies from talking too much. But you two? You're the fools who actually sit there and listen to your enemy's meandering monologues.",
  ["100102161_37"]="Once again, Ereshan wields her crescent scythe.",
  ["100102161_38"]="Zero positions herself in front of me, but Ereshan does not attack us.",
  ["100102161_39"]="With a muffled sound, the floor cracks beneath our feet, spreading like a spiderweb.",
  ["100102161_4"]="There were moments when I thought you might figure it out, but no, you just stayed at the edge of truth and refused to step forward.",
  ["100102161_40"]="Zero, you've become dull.",
  ["100102161_41"]="Next time, when you feel something is off, just slit your opponent's throat instead of waiting around.",
  ["100102161_42"]="The giant roars, rushing toward us. The cracked floor falters under its weight, crumbling from the edges.",
  ["100102161_43"]="At that moment, everyone near the edge of the room begins to fall.",
  ["100102161_44"]="Debris strikes my forehead, causing a sharp, lightning-like pain that momentarily clouds my mind.",
  ["100102161_45"]="Zero immediately makes her decision. She grabs my hand and holds me tightly as Anchirp transforms into a massive golden bird, carrying both of us upward.",
  ["100102161_46"]="Ereshan, however, remains calm, letting her body fall into the bottomless void.",
  ["100102161_47"]="Instinctively, I reach out my hand towards Ereshan.",
  ["100102161_48"]="Goodbye...",
  ["100102161_49"]="My vision blurred by debris and sand, I see her with remarkable clarity, wearing a relieved smile like the last radiance of a dying star.",
  ["100102161_5"]="...",
  ["100102161_50"]="No. Farewell. Forever.",
  ["100102161_51"]="My eyes widen as she disappears.",
  ["100102161_52"]="Once again, I have failed to grasp anything.",
  ["100102161_6"]="But why? Let me guess. Because you don't understand my motives, so you chose to turn a blind eye.",
  ["100102161_7"]="How arrogant.",
  ["100102161_8"]="Oh, Zero, empty of everything, void of emotions. Yet, in the end, you earned everything.",
  ["100102161_9"]="...",
  ["100102162_1"]="The golden light strikes the giant's legs, shattering them completely as Zero unleashes her full strength.",
  ["100102162_10"]="It reaches out its hand towards the back of the two people moving away.",
  ["100102162_11"]="If you truly are from two and a half thousand years from now...",
  ["100102162_12"]="Tell me... tell me... tell me...",
  ["100102162_2"]="The giant collapses to the ground yet still crawls toward us.",
  ["100102162_3"]="Let's go.",
  ["100102162_4"]="Don't you dare run away...",
  ["100102162_5"]="Face... me...",
  ["100102162_6"]="The nameless tyrant crawls on the ground, struggling to move forward.",
  ["100102162_7"]="He has lost his horse, his army, his dignity, and his humanity.",
  ["100102162_8"]="After five hundred years, he was finally reunited with the Eme-an who once deceived him.",
  ["100102162_9"]="O, Eme-ans from the future...",
  ["100102171_1"]="The End of the World",
  ["100102171_10"]="You may perceive the world as a series of clay slabs, stretching from one end to the other, with mountains and seas interspersed in between.",
  ["100102171_100"]="Let him see them again...",
  ["100102171_101"]="Darius closes his eyes.",
  ["100102171_102"]="Let him see them again.",
  ["100102171_11"]="However, the world is a sphere, where the beginning meets the end. When one reaches the supposed edge of the world, they find themselves back where they started.",
  ["100102171_12"]="Pythagoras closes his eyes, only to be met with the resounding laughter from the emperor.",
  ["100102171_13"]="Haha... Hahahaha.",
  ["100102171_14"]="What an absurd statement. It's been quite some time since someone dared to be so audacious in my court. Nevertheless, I shall allow you to continue your discourse, purely for the sake of entertainment.",
  ["100102171_15"]="However, if your words bore me, it'll be more than just your tongue that I remove.",
  ["100102171_16"]="You claim that the world is a sphere. Very well, prove it to me.",
  ["100102171_17"]="Yes, Your Majesty.",
  ["100102171_18"]="As an emperor who has conquered numerous lands, you must be aware that the North Star appears higher in the sky the further north one travels, and conversely, it appears lower in the southern regions.",
  ["100102171_19"]="When observing a ship approaching from the horizon, one perceives the mast before the deck becomes visible.",
  ["100102171_2"]="Tell me, Eme-an, is everything you've just said true?",
  ["100102171_20"]="The world is indeed a sphere, and the curvature of the land and the sea occurs beyond the range of our vision. It is due to the vastness of the world that, while standing upon it, we mistake it for being flat.",
  ["100102171_21"]="To humans, Obed may appear immense, but to the entire world, Obed is merely a small portion of the spherical whole.",
  ["100102171_22"]="Just as ants may consider mounds as mountains and ponds as oceans, when they climb a tree, they perceive it as occupying a vast territory.",
  ["100102171_23"]="I intend no disrespect, but when your army arrived at the Great Desert and believed they had conquered the entire southern realm, they were akin to those ants.",
  ["100102171_24"]="Darius could have swiftly executed him for such a daring statement.",
  ["100102171_25"]="However, Darius takes a moment to ponder before continuing his inquiry.",
  ["100102171_26"]="...",
  ["100102171_27"]="Why a sphere?",
  ["100102171_28"]="Because a sphere is the most perfect shape in existence.",
  ["100102171_29"]="Natural forces strive to minimize the size of objects in all dimensions. A sphere possesses the smallest surface area for a given enclosed volume. It epitomizes perfection.",
  ["100102171_3"]="I believe you're aware that I've showered you with the utmost respect from an emperor.",
  ["100102171_30"]="I don't quite understand the ramblings of your crazy mind, but I can grasp that you consider the sphere to be the most favored shape.",
  ["100102171_31"]="Indeed, Your Majesty.",
  ["100102171_32"]="If your claims hold true, then regardless of how far I traverse, I shall never surpass its boundaries and merely return to my starting point.",
  ["100102171_33"]="That is correct.",
  ["100102171_34"]="...",
  ["100102171_35"]="Darius falls into deep contemplation.",
  ["100102171_36"]="Pythagoras sighs and speaks once more.",
  ["100102171_37"]="It is true, Your Majesty, that the concept of an \"end\" does not truly exist upon this sphere where you currently stand.",
  ["100102171_38"]="Pythagoras points in a particular direction, guiding Darius' gaze.",
  ["100102171_39"]="I implore you to direct your attention there.",
  ["100102171_4"]="I believe you're also aware that the nonsense you just said is enough for me to order your tongue removed.",
  ["100102171_40"]="Darius' gaze follows Pythagoras' finger, and then, he sees...",
  ["100102171_41"]="The boundless expanse of stars adorning the night sky.",
  ["100102171_42"]="The sky?",
  ["100102171_43"]="Precisely, Your Majesty. The sky.",
  ["100102171_44"]="Just as the earth beneath our feet is a sphere, so too are the moon and the sun—spheres of varying sizes.",
  ["100102171_45"]="Darius interrupts Pythagoras.",
  ["100102171_46"]="If the stars in the sky are indeed, as you claim, spheres, and the ground beneath our feet is but an inconsequential fragment from one of these spheres...",
  ["100102171_47"]="Doesn't that mean that all the land I've conquered so far is just a speck of dust in a vast sea of sand?",
  ["100102171_48"]="It may be just a speck of dust, but it's a precious speck of dust and our homeland. However, it's undeniable that it is, after all, just a speck of dust.",
  ["100102171_49"]="Perhaps only by traversing this desert, which contains countless specks of dust, will you truly reach the \"end\" of the world.",
  ["100102171_5"]="The emperor's voice remains calm with only a hint of annoyance, but his gaze beneath his drooping eyelids displays a childlike curiosity.",
  ["100102171_50"]="...",
  ["100102171_51"]="Are you frustrated by this revelation, Your Majesty?",
  ["100102171_52"]="It's a capital offense to try to speculate on the mind of an emperor.",
  ["100102171_53"]="Please forgive my audacity. All I meant to express is that I have found solace in this realization.",
  ["100102171_54"]="Solace, you say?",
  ["100102171_55"]="Yes, I felt a sense of solace knowing that our thoughts, struggles, and everything we hold dear are insignificant compared to the world itself.",
  ["100102171_56"]="Every day in this land, people kill or are killed, pillage or are pillaged, for land, food, faith, and dogma.",
  ["100102171_57"]="Yet, when I gaze upon the starry sky, all of their deeds fade away.",
  ["100102171_58"]="It reminds us that our thoughts and actions can be influenced by our self-centered perspectives. It highlights the limitations of our vision and the shallowness of our ideas.",
  ["100102171_59"]="Pythagoras raises his head and looks into Darius' eyes.",
  ["100102171_6"]="I've conquered the south, reaching the edge of the world—a great achievement that should be engraved in your libraries—yet you told me I'm far from seeing the entirety of this world.",
  ["100102171_60"]="The world does not revolve around us, not even the ground beneath our feet.",
  ["100102171_61"]="Consider how an adult perceives a toddler's cries. The toddler cries because they have never seen the real world and are ignorant of real problems.",
  ["100102171_62"]="However, with this revelation, you would understand that the difficulties and confusion you currently face are, in the grand scheme, similar to a toddler's cry.",
  ["100102171_63"]="Look at the curtain of stars above you. It will make us reevaluate the value of all people to one another and the value of all people to the world.",
  ["100102171_64"]="Ha.",
  ["100102171_65"]="Darius laughs.",
  ["100102171_66"]="Well, that was quite a speech. You asked if I'm frustrated, but it seems you're the one who is frustrated.",
  ["100102171_67"]="Pythagoras pauses briefly and lets out a gentle sigh.",
  ["100102171_68"]="Indeed, Your Majesty... No matter how much I stretch, I can't reach the stars with my hands.",
  ["100102171_69"]="Come to think of it, it's a good reason you'd give.",
  ["100102171_7"]="Pythagoras replies humbly:",
  ["100102171_70"]="However, in the next moment, the smile at the corner of Darius' mouth disappears, as he strikes the ground heavily with the scepter in his hand.",
  ["100102171_71"]="Such is your greatest insolence. You, a mere mortal, dare to speculate on the thoughts of the King of All Kings?",
  ["100102171_72"]="Do you think my silence was because of frustration?",
  ["100102171_73"]="Ridiculous. How ridiculous. Do you understand what it means to tell the King of All Kings that there are countless other worlds like ours?",
  ["100102171_74"]="Darius extends his hand toward the stars in the sky.",
  ["100102171_75"]="It means there are endless lands waiting to be conquered!",
  ["100102171_76"]="Interesting! How interesting! If the barren desert in the south is the so-called \"end of the world,\" that would be truly disappointing!",
  ["100102171_77"]="This world is so subtle and so vast, but as a scholar, all you do is revere it. This is where I'd say your mind is narrow!",
  ["100102171_78"]="I'll conquer them. It's the highest form of homage I, as an emperor, can offer.",
  ["100102171_79"]="Pythagoras widens his eyes slightly.",
  ["100102171_8"]="Indeed, Your Majesty.",
  ["100102171_80"]="Then, for the first time, the haughty Eme-an bows slightly, acknowledging the emperor of the mortals.",
  ["100102171_81"]="I am delighted that you are the ruler of this land, Your Majesty.",
  ["100102171_82"]="Instead of looking at Pythagoras, Darius gazes at the distant stars, his hand clenched into a fist.",
  ["100102171_83"]="Eme-an, I will be the one to conquer the distant stars.",
  ["100102171_84"]="The nameless tyrant stops crawling forward.",
  ["100102171_85"]="That distant and brilliant curtain of stars, long forgotten, reappears before his eyes.",
  ["100102171_86"]="The embers of his ambition, for a moment, rekindle.",
  ["100102171_87"]="The unnamed tyrant, for a brief moment, becomes the revered King of All Kings once again.",
  ["100102171_88"]="The goal it pursued, the answers it sought...",
  ["100102171_89"]="Darius raises his head high and shouts into the void.",
  ["100102171_9"]="You will certainly go down in history as a great emperor, Your Majesty. But with all due respect, this world has no edges, and you are far from owning it.",
  ["100102171_90"]="Tell me, Eme-ans from the future. Tell me...",
  ["100102171_91"]="Did I... conquer the distant stars?",
  ["100102171_92"]="Ah...",
  ["100102171_93"]="He remembers everything again.",
  ["100102171_94"]="You truly are my favorite servant, Farhad.",
  ["100102171_95"]="Arise, for I shall share my glory and dreams with you.",
  ["100102171_96"]="One day, we'll leave our footprints across the entire expanse of the sky!",
  ["100102171_97"]="That night, he stood beside the fire, counting the wisps of flame, recalling all the wonders he had encountered along the way back from his expedition. And then, he saw a sky full of stars reflected in the stream to his side.",
  ["100102171_98"]="At that moment, he couldn't help but raised his head, gazing up at the starry sky.",
  ["100102171_99"]="The starry sky shone above like trembling silver foil... The Milky Way that flowed silently through the summer night...",
  ["1001022"]="Li Chi",
  ["1001023"]="Ji Xia",
  ["1001024"]="Yuli",
  ["1001026"]="Phaenomena",
  ["1001027"]="Ariadne",
  ["100103011_1"]="The End of the Light",
  ["100103011_10"]="Why does light refract when it enters water?",
  ["100103011_11"]="That's an interesting question. I have two answers for you.",
  ["100103011_12"]="The first answer is that light refracts because air and water are different mediums. When we look at this question from a cause-and-effect perspective, we arrive at this answer.",
  ["100103011_13"]="But in fact, light simply chooses the path that takes the least amount of time. Such is the Principle of Least Time, proposed by a scholar named Fermat.",
  ["100103011_14"]="Light determines the optimal path even before embarking on its journey, as it is aware of its ultimate destination.",
  ["100103011_15"]="You may find this concept challenging to grasp at the moment, but someday you will understand.",
  ["100103011_16"]="Because you'll become that light, my beloved child.",
  ["100103011_17"]="The fall abruptly halts, gravity reversing. The world in Ereshan's eyes becomes upside down.",
  ["100103011_18"]="The immense potential energy accumulated during her descent dissipates instantly, and Ereshan lands steadily on the floor.",
  ["100103011_19"]="Standing on the steel floor, Ereshan looks at the path ahead and softly sighs.",
  ["100103011_2"]="Falling.",
  ["100103011_20"]="...",
  ["100103011_21"]="You chose the shortest path because you knew where you would end up, right?",
  ["100103011_22"]="How much had you calculated?",
  ["100103011_23"]="...",
  ["100103011_24"]="Forget it. It doesn't matter. The outcome remains the same despite efforts...",
  ["100103011_25"]="Ereshan lowers her gaze.",
  ["100103011_26"]="This is seriously... sickening.",
  ["100103011_27"]="The top floor of the Tower of Babel, before the activation of the Beacon.",
  ["100103011_28"]="The top floor of the Tower of Babel, before the activation of the Beacon.",
  ["100103011_29"]="Server Room, Top Floor",
  ["100103011_3"]="Falling.",
  ["100103011_30"]="Nanna leans against her desk, toying with a hexagonal seal in her hand.",
  ["100103011_31"]="How's it going, Shamash?",
  ["100103011_32"]="...",
  ["100103011_33"]="You're saying we can't retrieve the information because some of the ancient documents haven't been recorded in the database?",
  ["100103011_34"]="Yeah.",
  ["100103011_35"]="Hmm, that's a challenging situation.",
  ["100103011_36"]="The radioactivity tests on the sedimentary mud and carbon isotope measurements of biological remains attached to this copper sphere indicate that was buried in the Philistine Sea for at least two thousand years.",
  ["100103011_37"]="Even if we were to search for documents from that period now, it would likely take a while before we find something useful.",
  ["100103011_38"]="Unfortunately, we are shorthanded during this critical time...",
  ["100103011_39"]="Structure.",
  ["100103011_4"]="Constantly falling.",
  ["100103011_40"]="Are you asking about the structure of the copper sphere?",
  ["100103011_41"]="...",
  ["100103011_42"]="Unfortunately, our devices can't scan it. The sphere doesn't respond to X-ray transmission or diffraction tests, and its internal structure appears entirely indistinct.",
  ["100103011_43"]="The material from which this copper sphere was forged might not even exist in our world.",
  ["100103011_44"]="The Delphic Oracle might have some clues, but I'm afraid it's too late to contact them now.",
  ["100103011_45"]="...",
  ["100103011_46"]="What should we do now? Well, there isn't much we can do except guard it.",
  ["100103011_47"]="If the prophecy regarding its activation proves true, then someone will come to fulfill that prophecy.",
  ["100103011_48"]="And I'm curious to see who will do so right under our noses.",
  ["100103011_49"]="Nemesis.",
  ["100103011_5"]="Ereshan closes her eyes.",
  ["100103011_50"]="Heh, that's not something we should be concerned about. Instead of worrying about their invasion, we might as well keep an eye on the sphere in case it somehow activates on its own.",
  ["100103011_51"]="Hmm.",
  ["100103011_52"]="What's that?",
  ["100103011_53"]="This? Oh, it's a souvenir Cosmos left for me.",
  ["100103011_54"]="Nanna stares at the seal in her hand, the pattern on it matching the pendant in [BBNAME]'s hand. It is the last gift Cosmos gave her before he departed.",
  ["100103011_55"]="When you face a problem that you can't solve, use it, Nanna.",
  ["100103011_56"]="Cosmos, what are you planning?",
  ["100103011_57"]="I don't know what's going on with Ere and Zero now. Are they searching for Tasny? If they really found them...",
  ["100103011_58"]="Forget it. What am I even hoping for?",
  ["100103011_59"]="Nanna shakes her head, letting out a sigh, but her breath gets stuck in her chest.",
  ["100103011_6"]="The overwhelming sensation of weightlessness fills her with both terror and anticipation.",
  ["100103011_60"]="As the Beacon activates, the space fractures like a shattered mirror.",
  ["100103011_61"]="Amid the turbulence, Shamash swiftly wields the stone tablet as a shield, protecting himself and Nanna behind him.",
  ["100103011_62"]="Shamash!",
  ["100103011_63"]="The change occurs in an instant, and Nanna feels strange movements behind her.",
  ["100103011_64"]="When she turns around, she sees the copper sphere, which should have been lying on the ground like a boulder, but is floating in the turbulent space. It is soon swept away by the chaos, along with the fragmented walls.",
  ["100103011_65"]="Without hesitation, Nanna rushes towards the copper sphere, attempting to climb onto its ring. However, the sphere vanishes into the void before she can reach its edge.",
  ["100103011_66"]="...!",
  ["100103011_67"]="Dammit...",
  ["100103011_68"]="As the dust settles, Nanna shakes her head and sighs, observing the randomly reorganized space before her.",
  ["100103011_69"]="Misfortune has a knack for perfect timing.",
  ["100103011_7"]="She fears her impending death. Even if there happens to be a piece of debris in her falling trajectory, she knows she will face certain doom.",
  ["100103011_70"]="The space was never this unstable during previous activations. Why was it so turbulent this time?",
  ["100103011_71"]="Suddenly, they hear footsteps from behind, and both of them turn around.",
  ["100103011_72"]="An unexpected figure appears before their eyes.",
  ["100103011_73"]="Ere... what are you doing here?",
  ["100103011_8"]="As she anticipates her imminent death, this would be her final moment to finally escape a boring life.",
  ["100103011_9"]="During the fall where she knew the end, a conversation between her and her grandfather returns to her mind.",
  ["100103021_1"]="Paradoxical Spiral",
  ["100103021_10"]="Seer...",
  ["100103021_11"]="Goodbye...",
  ["100103021_12"]="No. Farewell. Forever.",
  ["100103021_13"]="[BBNAME].",
  ["100103021_14"]="(Open my eyes.)",
  ["100103021_15"]="Just as I hear someone calling my name, all my inner turmoil instantly subsides.",
  ["100103021_16"]="Suddenly, I find myself looking into Zero's eyes.",
  ["100103021_17"]="You have lost too much blood. I have barely managed to stop it.",
  ["100103021_18"]="Her face is so close that our breath seems to intertwine.",
  ["100103021_19"]="Are you feeling better now?",
  ["100103021_2"]="Soon it will obliterate this place completely.",
  ["100103021_20"]="Hastily, I turn my head, avoiding her gaze.",
  ["100103021_21"]="Mistaking my action an acknowledgment, Zero stands and pulls me up.",
  ["100103021_22"]="Darius...",
  ["100103021_23"]="What's the situation now?",
  ["100103021_24"]="It will not catch up with us anytime soon.",
  ["100103021_25"]="We are safe for now, but we cannot stay here much longer.",
  ["100103021_26"]="The situation does not look good.",
  ["100103021_27"]="You have been misled by the future Ereshan. We all were.",
  ["100103021_28"]="Her goal from the beginning was to find the divine words. She is the one who activated Aten.",
  ["100103021_29"]="We are now trapped in a paradoxical spiral, where the cause is the effect, and vice versa.",
  ["100103021_3"]="Find <color=#fec66b>Tasny</color>, and he'll help you discover that command.",
  ["100103021_30"]="We knew that Aten was about to explode, so we started searching for the divine words to prevent its explosion.",
  ["100103021_31"]="However, our action ends up creating the future where Aten explodes.",
  ["100103021_32"]="Why did Ereshan betray us?",
  ["100103021_33"]="I don't know.",
  ["100103021_34"]="Do you remember when we first met Ereshan?",
  ["100103021_35"]="(Share the images in my memory.)",
  ["100103021_36"]="I understand.",
  ["100103021_37"]="I need you to do something, Seer.",
  ["100103021_38"]="Take me to the place when we first embarked on the journey.",
  ["100103021_39"]="Her crystal-clear eyes reflect my awkward face. For a moment, I feel like I am about to drown in her golden-hued irises.",
  ["100103021_4"]="Seer.",
  ["100103021_40"]="You can do it, right?",
  ["100103021_41"]="(Close my eyes.)",
  ["100103021_42"]="Where are you going?",
  ["100103021_43"]="Good, everything will go as you wish.",
  ["100103021_44"]="My story is reaching its end.",
  ["100103021_45"]="But yours has just begun.",
  ["100103021_46"]="Keep going and do not look back. We will meet again.",
  ["100103021_47"]="[BBNAME].",
  ["100103021_48"]="We've arrived.",
  ["100103021_49"]="Yeah.",
  ["100103021_5"]="Instead of getting sidetracked by irrelevant stuff, perhaps we should focus on what to do next.",
  ["100103021_50"]="I glance around, and everything looks intact, unlike the crumbling world I remembered.",
  ["100103021_51"]="Since Ereshan intends to activate Aten and now has the divine words, she must be looking for it.",
  ["100103021_52"]="However...",
  ["100103021_53"]="However, she does not have the access to the entire Library. How is she supposed to find Aten?",
  ["100103021_54"]="If the Library of Babel truly extends infinitely around each Primordial Sector...",
  ["100103021_55"]="Then when it unfolds, the original Tower of Babel will become a sugar cube tossed into the ocean, and each sector will be scattered in an infinite ocean.",
  ["100103021_56"]="The probability of precisely locating another water molecule in this ocean is practically zero.",
  ["100103021_57"]="Moreover, time is also a dimension in this space. In this at least five dimensional spaces, any room that extends in time is grouped together.",
  ["100103021_58"]="As a result, even when one locates a specific region in a specific era, they will still be facing an almost infinite number of rooms.",
  ["100103021_59"]="Rooms from yesterday, from a year ago, from ten years ago, from tomorrow, from a year from now, and from ten years from now—they all coexist in the Library at the same time.",
  ["100103021_6"]="Seer...",
  ["100103021_60"]="The essence of your ability is moving instantaneously through this space.",
  ["100103021_61"]="Since time is simply one of the dimensions of space here, it is possible for one to walk from one time sector to another specific sector. While the probability is practically zero, it is not zero.",
  ["100103021_62"]="That is, as long as one has an endless lifespan, has traveled infinite distances on foot, and has tried enough directions.",
  ["100103021_63"]="I do not know exactly how Ereshan found Aten in the future you foresaw, but she did.",
  ["100103021_64"]="Her voice turns icy.",
  ["100103021_65"]="Let's go. Once we capture her and interrogate her, everything will come to light.",
  ["100103021_7"]="Farewell...",
  ["100103021_8"]="No.",
  ["100103021_9"]="It's <color=#fec66b>see you later</color>.",
  ["100103022_1"]="...",
  ["100103022_10"]="Nanna analyzes Ereshan from head to toe.",
  ["100103022_11"]="Where are Zero and [BBNAME]? Aren't you supposed to be together?",
  ["100103022_12"]="Ereshan casts a sidelong glance at Shamash, but her attention doesn't linger on him for long. She looks around in a seemingly casual way.",
  ["100103022_13"]="We were indeed together, but then I got swept away by the turbulence when the Beacon was activated.",
  ["100103022_14"]="Nanna glances at Shamash, who nods in response.",
  ["100103022_15"]="By the way, where is that copper sphere?",
  ["100103022_16"]="Our situation is similar to yours.",
  ["100103022_17"]="Nanna briefly explains what happened to Shamash and her.",
  ["100103022_18"]="Ereshan raises her brow after listening to Nanna's account.",
  ["100103022_19"]="Wait, what? You guys let that bomb out of your sight, and now you're standing here doing nothing about it?!",
  ["100103022_2"]="Shamash remains calm despite our sudden appearance, only nodding silently at us.",
  ["100103022_20"]="After finishing her accusation, Ereshan moves to leave.",
  ["100103022_21"]="However, Nanna steps in front of her, blocking her path.",
  ["100103022_22"]="The sphere is important. However, Ere, if I remember correctly, you went to the Modern Floor with Zero and [BBNAME], right?",
  ["100103022_23"]="Nanna's gaze is fixated on Ereshan.",
  ["100103022_24"]="So, how did you end up here?",
  ["100103022_25"]="What are you doubting?",
  ["100103022_26"]="I just want to confirm something.",
  ["100103022_27"]="Alright, then I'll get straight to the point.",
  ["100103022_28"]="The prophecy is true, and that outsider does have access to the entire Library. Not long ago, [BBNAME] took me and Zero to the time sector eighty years ago, and we met Tasny there.",
  ["100103022_29"]="Nanna's expression wavers at the mention of that name.",
  ["100103022_3"]="Shamash...",
  ["100103022_30"]="What did you say?",
  ["100103022_31"]="Ereshan pretends not to have noticed Nanna's reaction.",
  ["100103022_32"]="Tasny told us that the mechanical sphere is Aten, the God of the Sun in Memphian mythology, commanded by the binary language. It is the culprit that destroyed Ehtaton.",
  ["100103022_33"]="Soon, it will be activated again and obliterate the Library of Babel.",
  ["100103022_34"]="I got separated from them, and by the time I realized it, I was already here. Do you want to ask for more information? Or will you come with me and find that copper sphere?",
  ["100103022_35"]="Nanna is about to say something, but in the end, she just stares intensely into Ereshan's eyes.",
  ["100103022_36"]="Ereshan, are you the one who activated Aten?",
  ["100103022_37"]="Ereshan meets Nanna's gaze unflinchingly.",
  ["100103022_38"]="What are you even talking about? I intend to deactivate it.",
  ["100103022_39"]="After Ereshan finishes speaking, Nanna casts another glance at Shamash.",
  ["100103022_4"]="Zero quickly scans the surroundings. Instead of explaining to Shamash what happened to us along the way, she throws questions at him.",
  ["100103022_40"]="...",
  ["100103022_41"]="Ereshan shakes her head impatiently.",
  ["100103022_42"]="Whatever you say, I won't waste my time playing your detective game. You can't even keep a copper sphere safe. Honestly, this makes me wonder if you have stayed too long in the tower and your brains and bodies have started to rust...",
  ["100103022_43"]="Suspect me all you want. Just don't stand in my way.",
  ["100103022_44"]="Once again, Nanna stops Ereshan.",
  ["100103022_45"]="Hold on. I'll go with you.",
  ["100103022_46"]="Just as Shamash is about to follow, Nanna waves her hand casually.",
  ["100103022_47"]="Stay here, Shamash. Zero and [BBNAME] might arrive later. Someone should wait for them.",
  ["100103022_48"]="...",
  ["100103022_49"]="Don't worry. We'll be fine.",
  ["100103022_5"]="Where is that copper sphere? And where is Nanna?",
  ["100103022_6"]="Shamash frowns slightly, not out of displeasure, but having sensed something from Zero's attitude. He mutters a name.",
  ["100103022_7"]="Ereshan.",
  ["100103022_8"]="Not long ago...",
  ["100103022_9"]="Ere? How did you...?",
  ["100103023_1"]="Let's go. Once we capture her and interrogate her, everything will come to light.",
  ["100103023_10"]="The probability of precisely locating another water molecule in this ocean is practically zero.",
  ["100103023_11"]="Then when it unfolds, the original Tower of Babel will become a sugar cube tossed into the ocean, and each sector will be scattered in an infinite ocean.",
  ["100103023_12"]="If the Library of Babel truly extends infinitely around each Primordial Sector...",
  ["100103023_13"]="However, she does not have the access to the entire Library. How is she supposed to find Aten?",
  ["100103023_14"]="However...",
  ["100103023_15"]="Since Ereshan intends to activate Aten and now has the divine words, she must be looking for it.",
  ["100103023_16"]="I glance around, and everything looks intact, unlike the crumbling world I remembered.",
  ["100103023_17"]="Yes.",
  ["100103023_18"]="We've arrived.",
  ["100103023_19"]="[BBNAME].",
  ["100103023_2"]="Her voice turns icy.",
  ["100103023_20"]="Keep going and do not look back. We will meet again.",
  ["100103023_21"]="But yours has just begun.",
  ["100103023_22"]="My story is reaching its end.",
  ["100103023_23"]="Good, everything will go as you wish.",
  ["100103023_24"]="Where are you going?",
  ["100103023_25"]="(Close my eyes.)",
  ["100103023_26"]="You can do it, right?",
  ["100103023_27"]="Her crystal-clear eyes reflect my awkward face. For a moment, I feel like I am about to drown in her golden-hued irises.",
  ["100103023_28"]="Take me to the place when we first embarked on the journey.",
  ["100103023_29"]="I need you to do something, Seer.",
  ["100103023_3"]="I do not know exactly how Ereshan found Aten in the future you foresaw, but she did.",
  ["100103023_30"]="I understand.",
  ["100103023_31"]="(Share the images in my memory.)",
  ["100103023_32"]="Do you remember when we first met Ereshan?",
  ["100103023_33"]="I don't know.",
  ["100103023_34"]="Why did Ereshan betray us?",
  ["100103023_35"]="However, our action ends up creating the future where Aten explodes.",
  ["100103023_36"]="We knew that Aten was about to explode, so we started searching for the divine words to prevent its explosion.",
  ["100103023_37"]="We are now trapped in a paradoxical spiral, where the cause is the effect, and vice versa.",
  ["100103023_38"]="Her goal from the beginning was to find the divine words. She is the one who activated Aten.",
  ["100103023_39"]="You have been misled by the future Ereshan. We all were.",
  ["100103023_4"]="That is, as long as one has an endless lifespan, has traveled infinite distances on foot, and has tried enough directions.",
  ["100103023_40"]="The situation does not look good.",
  ["100103023_41"]="We are safe for now, but we cannot stay here much longer.",
  ["100103023_42"]="It will not catch up with us anytime soon.",
  ["100103023_43"]="Darius...",
  ["100103023_44"]="What's the situation now?",
  ["100103023_45"]="Mistaking my action an acknowledgment, Zero stands and pulls me up.",
  ["100103023_46"]="Hastily, I turn my head, avoiding her gaze.",
  ["100103023_47"]="Are you feeling better now?",
  ["100103023_48"]="Her face is so close that our breath seems to intertwine.",
  ["100103023_49"]="You have lost too much blood. I have barely managed to stop it.",
  ["100103023_5"]="Since time is simply one of the dimensions of space here, it is possible for one to walk from one time sector to another specific sector. While the probability is practically zero, it is not zero.",
  ["100103023_50"]="Suddenly, I find myself looking into Zero's eyes.",
  ["100103023_51"]="Just as I hear someone calling my name, all my inner turmoil instantly subsides.",
  ["100103023_52"]="(Open my eyes.)",
  ["100103023_53"]="[BBNAME].",
  ["100103023_54"]="No. Farewell. Forever.",
  ["100103023_55"]="Goodbye...",
  ["100103023_56"]="Seer...",
  ["100103023_57"]="It's <color=#fec66b>see you later</color>.",
  ["100103023_58"]="No.",
  ["100103023_59"]="Farewell...",
  ["100103023_6"]="The essence of your ability is moving instantaneously through this space.",
  ["100103023_60"]="Seer...",
  ["100103023_61"]="Instead of getting sidetracked by irrelevant stuff, perhaps we should focus on what to do next.",
  ["100103023_62"]="Seer.",
  ["100103023_63"]="Find <color=#fec66b>Tasny</color>, and he'll help you discover that command.",
  ["100103023_64"]="Soon it will obliterate this place completely.",
  ["100103023_65"]="Paradoxical Spiral",
  ["100103023_7"]="Rooms from yesterday, from a year ago, from ten years ago, from tomorrow, from a year from now, and from ten years from now—they all coexist in the Library at the same time.",
  ["100103023_8"]="As a result, even when one locates a specific region in a specific era, they will still be facing an almost infinite number of rooms.",
  ["100103023_9"]="Moreover, time is also a dimension in this space. In this at least five dimensional spaces, any room that extends in time is grouped together.",
  ["100103024_1"]="Don't worry. We'll be fine.",
  ["100103024_10"]="...",
  ["100103024_11"]="After Ereshan finishes speaking, Nanna casts another glance at Shamash.",
  ["100103024_12"]="What are you even talking about? I intend to deactivate it.",
  ["100103024_13"]="Ereshan meets Nanna's gaze unflinchingly.",
  ["100103024_14"]="Ereshan, are you the one who activated Aten?",
  ["100103024_15"]="Nanna is about to say something, but in the end, she just stares intensely into Ereshan's eyes.",
  ["100103024_16"]="I got separated from them, and by the time I realized it, I was already here. Do you want to ask for more information? Or will you come with me and find that copper sphere?",
  ["100103024_17"]="Soon, it will be activated again and obliterate the Library of Babel.",
  ["100103024_18"]="Tasny told us that the mechanical sphere is Aten, the God of the Sun in Memphian mythology, commanded by the binary language. It is the culprit that destroyed Ehtaton.",
  ["100103024_19"]="Ereshan pretends not to have noticed Nanna's reaction.",
  ["100103024_2"]="...",
  ["100103024_20"]="What did you say?",
  ["100103024_21"]="Nanna's expression wavers at the mention of that name.",
  ["100103024_22"]="The prophecy is true, and that outsider does have access to the entire Library. Not long ago, [BBNAME] took me and Zero to the time sector eighty years ago, and we met Tasny there.",
  ["100103024_23"]="Alright, then I'll get straight to the point.",
  ["100103024_24"]="I just want to confirm something.",
  ["100103024_25"]="What are you doubting?",
  ["100103024_26"]="So, how did you end up here?",
  ["100103024_27"]="Nanna's gaze is fixated on Ereshan.",
  ["100103024_28"]="The sphere is important. However, Ere, if I remember correctly, you went to the Modern Floor with Zero and [BBNAME], right?",
  ["100103024_29"]="However, Nanna steps in front of her, blocking her path.",
  ["100103024_3"]="Stay here, Shamash. Zero and [BBNAME] might arrive later. Someone should wait for them.",
  ["100103024_30"]="After finishing her accusation, Ereshan moves to leave.",
  ["100103024_31"]="Wait, what? You guys let that bomb out of your sight, and now you're standing here doing nothing about it?!",
  ["100103024_32"]="Ereshan raises her brow after listening to Nanna's account.",
  ["100103024_33"]="Nanna briefly explains what happened to Shamash and her.",
  ["100103024_34"]="Our situation is similar to yours.",
  ["100103024_35"]="By the way, where is that copper sphere?",
  ["100103024_36"]="Nanna glances at Shamash, who nods in response.",
  ["100103024_37"]="We were indeed together, but then I got swept away by the turbulence when the Beacon was activated.",
  ["100103024_38"]="Ereshan casts a sidelong glance at Shamash, but her attention doesn't linger on him for long. She looks around in a seemingly casual way.",
  ["100103024_39"]="Where are Zero and [BBNAME]? Aren't you supposed to be together?",
  ["100103024_4"]="Just as Shamash is about to follow, Nanna waves her hand casually.",
  ["100103024_40"]="Nanna analyzes Ereshan from head to toe.",
  ["100103024_41"]="Ere? How did you...?",
  ["100103024_42"]="Not long ago...",
  ["100103024_43"]="Ereshan.",
  ["100103024_44"]="Shamash frowns slightly, not out of displeasure, but having sensed something from Zero's attitude. He mutters a name.",
  ["100103024_45"]="Where is that copper sphere? And where is Nanna?",
  ["100103024_46"]="Zero quickly scans the surroundings. Instead of explaining to Shamash what happened to us along the way, she throws questions at him.",
  ["100103024_47"]="Shamash...",
  ["100103024_48"]="Shamash remains calm despite our sudden appearance, only nodding silently at us.",
  ["100103024_49"]="...",
  ["100103024_5"]="Hold on. I'll go with you.",
  ["100103024_6"]="Once again, Nanna stops Ereshan.",
  ["100103024_7"]="Suspect me all you want. Just don't stand in my way.",
  ["100103024_8"]="Whatever you say, I won't waste my time playing your detective game. You can't even keep a copper sphere safe. Honestly, this makes me wonder if you have stayed too long in the tower and your brains and bodies have started to rust...",
  ["100103024_9"]="Ereshan shakes her head impatiently.",
  ["100103031_1"]="A Complete Break",
  ["100103031_10"]="But deactivating Aten itself is activating it. The command is a palindrome, and it can cause Aten to perform very different behaviors.",
  ["100103031_11"]="...",
  ["100103031_12"]="Go.",
  ["100103031_13"]="For the first time, he speaks in a complete sentence:",
  ["100103031_14"]="Go find Nanna. Tell me the rest on the way.",
  ["100103031_2"]="Shamash murmurs a few names and some vague words, and Zero seems to understand everything.",
  ["100103031_3"]="So, Nanna left with Ereshan.",
  ["100103031_4"]="Yeah.",
  ["100103031_5"]="Zero sighs softly.",
  ["100103031_6"]="...",
  ["100103031_7"]="So, long story short, Shamash...",
  ["100103031_8"]="Ereshan has betrayed us. She is the one who activated Aten.",
  ["100103031_9"]="She was not lying when she said she wanted to \"deactivate\" Aten.",
  ["100103032_1"]="These traces are...",
  ["100103032_10"]="Ereshan runs ahead of Nanna at a fast pace.",
  ["100103032_11"]="Watching Ereshan's back, Nanna suddenly lets out a soft chuckle.",
  ["100103032_12"]="Seriously? Laughing at a time like this?",
  ["100103032_13"]="Well, when I see you running ahead of me, I can't help but think of the time when you were still a little girl.",
  ["100103032_14"]="Do you remember when Cosmos brought you back to the tower? You were only as tall as my knee back then.",
  ["100103032_15"]="You couldn't even walk properly, and when you bumped into the corner of a table while running around, you would sit on the ground and shed tears in silence.",
  ["100103032_16"]="You know, I always wondered how a kid could resist crying when she was in pain. I used to deal with other kids in the tower, and even if their finger was only poked by a pen, they'd make a fuss loud enough to alert the entire tower.",
  ["100103032_17"]="You sound like an old lady when you talk about my childhood. Seriously, what's the deal with your body. So many years passed, but you're getting younger...",
  ["100103032_18"]="Instead of answering Ereshan's question, Nanna continues speaking.",
  ["100103032_19"]="At that time, to met Cosmos' expectations of you. You filled your mind with all those profound and difficult things just like an emotionless robot... just like Zero now.",
  ["100103032_2"]="Ereshan...",
  ["100103032_20"]="Then Cosmos announced that you wouldn't be the next director, and you changed.",
  ["100103032_21"]="Enough.",
  ["100103032_22"]="Back then, I thought it was a positive change. You'd shed all your burdens and responsibilities, becoming completely light in your soul and being true to yourself.",
  ["100103032_23"]="But then I realized I was wrong. You were simply learning to pretend.",
  ["100103032_24"]="Shut up!",
  ["100103032_25"]="Nanna stops suddenly.",
  ["100103032_26"]="I've always believed that apart from Cosmos, no one else knows you better than I do.",
  ["100103032_27"]="Realizing that Nanna has stopped, Ereshan also slows her pace and turns her head, her expression unusually serious.",
  ["100103032_28"]="Nanna's face is devoid of her usual smile. She wears a cold expression, as if she is about to interrogate a criminal.",
  ["100103032_29"]="Ere, you can still come back.",
  ["100103032_3"]="The crisscrossing scratches we see here are the evidence of a fierce battle took place earlier.",
  ["100103032_30"]="What are you talking about?",
  ["100103032_31"]="Do you know why I didn't bring Shamash along with me?",
  ["100103032_32"]="Without waiting for Ereshan's answer, Nanna continues.",
  ["100103032_33"]="He's too straightforward. If he had come with me, we wouldn't be having a conversation like this.",
  ["100103032_34"]="I'm giving you a chance, Ereshan. You can still come back now.",
  ["100103032_35"]="You're still testing me.",
  ["100103032_36"]="I know what you want to say. Everything you said in front of Shamash is true because Shamash can see through all lies.",
  ["100103032_37"]="But you were withholding some key information, weren't you?",
  ["100103032_38"]="...",
  ["100103032_39"]="I've accompanied you since you were young. There are things I can see even when you don't say anything.",
  ["100103032_4"]="Shamash walks up to one of the marks and crouches down on one knee.",
  ["100103032_40"]="Since I heard from [BBNAME] that you brought the warning about the sphere destroying this place in the future, I've been wondering who could have activated it right under our noses.",
  ["100103032_41"]="No one would suspect you because you were the one warning us and insisting we prevent such a future.",
  ["100103032_42"]="But all Eme-ans know one thing for sure: prophecies are destined. Once a future is given, it's irreversible because at that moment, it's no longer a future, but a part that has already happened.",
  ["100103032_43"]="The warning to \"prevent such a future\" doesn't make any sense at all.",
  ["100103032_44"]="Ha... haha... I knew you'd figure it out, but I didn't expect you to go along with my lies when you knew I was lying.",
  ["100103032_45"]="Because I wanted to have a genuine conversation with you alone, to get an answer. I don't get it, Ereshan. I don't know why you've decided to betray us. That's the only thing I don't understand.",
  ["100103032_46"]="Tell me, what exactly do you want to do?",
  ["100103032_47"]="Ereshan's words take a different tone.",
  ["100103032_48"]="Do you trust me or Cosmos, Nanna?",
  ["100103032_49"]="Why are you asking this?",
  ["100103032_5"]="Nanna.",
  ["100103032_50"]="Well, you don't have to answer my question. I already know.",
  ["100103032_51"]="Since you're well aware that a prophecy's future is destined past, you should know that you won't make it.",
  ["100103032_52"]="Nanna doesn't respond to Ereshan's question. Instead, she swiftly draws a sharp scimitar in the right hand, its blade resembling a crescent.",
  ["100103032_53"]="I taught you everything you know. Do you think you can defeat me in a one-on-one fight?",
  ["100103032_54"]="Before the words leave her lips, Nanna charges towards Ereshan at an incredible speed.",
  ["100103032_55"]="The clash of scythe and scimitar fills the air with a buzzing sound.",
  ["100103032_56"]="Ereshan immediately retreats after the first round of flashes. The tingling sensation in her hand reminds her that she is at a disadvantage.",
  ["100103032_57"]="However, she remains calm and raises her head, wielding a bright smile at the serious Nanna.",
  ["100103032_58"]="Nanna, I met two children. They're Tasny... No, they're Ninsar and Enki.",
  ["100103032_59"]="...!",
  ["100103032_6"]="And there was Ereshan.",
  ["100103032_60"]="Nanna's pupils contract slightly, the scimitar in her hand hesitating for a moment.",
  ["100103032_61"]="At that exact instant, Ereshan vanishes from Nanna's sight like a specter.",
  ["100103032_62"]="What did you say?",
  ["100103032_63"]="Nanna's voice trembles, yet she is unaware of it.",
  ["100103032_64"]="However, all the response she gets is the faint echo of Ereshan's voice.",
  ["100103032_65"]="They asked me to send their regards... Enheduanna...",
  ["100103032_7"]="These two sets of tracks diverge, as if they went their separate ways before a winner could be decided.",
  ["100103032_8"]="Zero runs fingertips over the traces left by the scythe, her expression grim.",
  ["100103032_9"]="Looks like Nanna has sensed something.",
  ["100103041_1"]="Split Up",
  ["100103041_10"]="Shamash knows all the information, and he is going to deliver it to Nanna.",
  ["100103041_11"]="As for us, we will go after Ereshan.",
  ["100103041_12"]="What if she attacks us?",
  ["100103041_13"]="What if she doesn't cooperate?",
  ["100103041_14"]="It doesn't matter. Suppressing her is not a problem for me.",
  ["100103041_15"]="She says it calmly, her words devoid of any contempt.",
  ["100103041_16"]="But that makes her even more condescending.",
  ["100103041_17"]="I suddenly realize that perhaps this girl in front of me... who has been the most obedient from the start... is the one who maintains the greatest distance.",
  ["100103041_2"]="Realizing that Nanna and Ereshan have gone their separate ways, Zero and Shamash make the same decision.",
  ["100103041_3"]="I'll go find Nanna.",
  ["100103041_4"]="Yeah.",
  ["100103041_5"]="Shamash nods at Zero and leaves without looking back.",
  ["100103041_6"]="So, we don't stick together?",
  ["100103041_7"]="What about us?",
  ["100103041_8"]="There is no point in going together. Nanna will surely be able to handle Ereshan.",
  ["100103041_9"]="Since she did not choose to pursue her, she must have her own plans.",
  ["100103051_1"]="Farewell",
  ["100103051_10"]="Even our current course of stopping Ereshan feels like it is being dictated by destiny.",
  ["100103051_11"]="I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by that.",
  ["100103051_12"]="Let's keep moving.",
  ["100103051_13"]="Even though the future is destined, we will do our best to defy it.",
  ["100103051_14"]="Perhaps even our struggle is part of destiny.",
  ["100103051_2"]="The further I advance, the more anxious I become.",
  ["100103051_3"]="The scene before my eyes becomes more similar to the one in my memory.",
  ["100103051_4"]="Zero stops and looks back at me, confused, silently asking why I am stopping.",
  ["100103051_5"]="Can we really stop her?",
  ["100103051_6"]="Let's keep moving.",
  ["100103051_7"]="...",
  ["100103051_8"]="Surprisingly, Zero doesn't answer my question this time.",
  ["100103051_9"]="In this realm, we have seen far too many Oedipal tragedies.",
  ["100103052_1"]="As the tangled figures separate once again, Ereshan's face loses its calm. She steps back, looking for a way to escape, but she's trapped at the edge of the platform.",
  ["100103052_10"]="No, I'm not the one who'll be running away.",
  ["100103052_11"]="Wait, Zero...",
  ["100103052_12"]="Although Ereshan is cornered, her voice carries true confidence.",
  ["100103052_13"]="Didn't I tell you? You're a bit too late.",
  ["100103052_14"]="Ereshan snaps her fingers.",
  ["100103052_15"]="That concludes the prologue. Now it's time for the climax.",
  ["100103052_16"]="As if in response to Ereshan's words, a foreboding sound fills the air, emanating from the distant reaches of space.",
  ["100103052_17"]="It is an echo from the past, spreading out like ripples, layer after layer.",
  ["100103052_18"]="And then...",
  ["100103052_19"]="The sun.",
  ["100103052_2"]="What a monster. Is there anyone who can defeat you now?",
  ["100103052_20"]="The artificial sun ascends slowly in front of our eyes.",
  ["100103052_21"]="In silence, it casts an ominous and despairing hue upon us.",
  ["100103052_22"]="Heh, it took so long to boot up. This antique isn't that impressive after all.",
  ["100103052_23"]="If you had listened to my explanation back then, I would have told you that I had already activated Aten, and that was your last chance to escape.",
  ["100103052_24"]="Do you have the slightest idea what this will lead to?!",
  ["100103052_25"]="Zero's eyes widen. A crack finally appears in her icy demeanor as she reaches out her hand to Ereshan.",
  ["100103052_26"]="Come to me, Ereshan.",
  ["100103052_27"]="...",
  ["100103052_28"]="Ereshan closes her eyes, delivering the last response in silence.",
  ["100103052_29"]="The next moment, an intensified \"gaze\" courses through me, causing the hairs on my body to stand on end.",
  ["100103052_3"]="Zero calmly smooths out her skirt with her slender fingers, her voice announcing Ereshan's defeat.",
  ["100103052_30"]="Instinctively, I turn my gaze towards the sun high above Ereshan's head.",
  ["100103052_31"]="Though it possessed no eyes, I can feel Aten's gaze upon me.",
  ["100103052_32"]="The realization that the sun is watching me sends a shiver down my spine.",
  ["100103052_33"]="!",
  ["100103052_34"]="Zero seems to understand this as well. Her eyes shift to mine, filling with surprise, before settling upon Aten once more.",
  ["100103052_35"]="Aten's light flares up and then fades quickly, and the spots on the sphere gradually disappear.",
  ["100103052_36"]="We are so close to it, which means...",
  ["100103052_37"]="We...",
  ["100103052_38"]="Without any hesitation, Zero shields me with her body.",
  ["100103052_39"]="Run.",
  ["100103052_4"]="You are exhausted. Stop your pointless struggle.",
  ["100103052_40"]="It is as if time has slowed down.",
  ["100103052_41"]="As Zero takes her first step, the sphere reacts as if it senses something and repositions its muzzle.",
  ["100103052_42"]="When Zero raises her staff, the muzzle is locked onto us.",
  ["100103052_43"]="The golden radiance within the muzzle reaches its peak.",
  ["100103052_44"]="Anzu!",
  ["100103052_45"]="Just as Zero's words leave her lips, the radiance erupts from the sphere, engulfing everything in its path.",
  ["100103052_46"]="Everything touched by the beam is instantly vaporized.",
  ["100103052_47"]="A scorching heat resembling the surface of the sun annihilates everything into nothingness.",
  ["100103052_48"]="And then...",
  ["100103052_49"]="The beam strikes the colossal golden bird that has landed before us. Anzu lets out a sharp chirp, transforming into a golden barrier, shielding Zero.",
  ["100103052_5"]="Ereshan freezes for a while before bursting into laughter.",
  ["100103052_50"]="The dazzling light almost blinds me.",
  ["100103052_51"]="At that moment, it feels as if magma courses through my veins instead of blood.",
  ["100103052_52"]="Zero's eyes widen as she stares into the sun.",
  ["100103052_53"]="And then, everything is annihilated by the white radiance.",
  ["100103052_6"]="Ha-hahahaha... to be so arrogant at a time like this. You even deliberately avoided hitting my critical spots. Curse you, you're not taking me seriously at all.",
  ["100103052_7"]="Alright, I didn't expect to best you anyway. We'll settle this score another time.",
  ["100103052_8"]="Zero furrows her brow at Ereshan's words.",
  ["100103052_9"]="Do you think you can still run away?",
  ["100103061_1"]="Nemesis",
  ["100103061_10"]="...",
  ["100103061_100"]="I understand you had a rough time in your last operation. You even use the Charybdis, but didn't get the God of the Sun you've been longing for in the end.",
  ["100103061_101"]="Well, I happen to have a generous soul and enjoy sharing with my partners.",
  ["100103061_102"]="How about this? You're free to research the God of the Sun all you want, and you only need to share the results with me. What do you say? You enjoy the research process, right?",
  ["100103061_103"]="Moreover, I'm not particularly interested in that copper ball. All I need is the technology to create a fusion reactor.",
  ["100103061_104"]="...",
  ["100103061_105"]="Well... that's acceptable.",
  ["100103061_106"]="But then again, compared to Japheth, what concerns me more is the organization on the other side of the continent... the ancient nation as old as Obed.",
  ["100103061_107"]="While it appears gentle and reserved, it possesses the wisest brain in the world. They might be able to foretell the approaching storm, and that's the uncertainty that worries me.",
  ["100103061_108"]="A warm voice responds to Martyr's question.",
  ["100103061_109"]="Don't worry.",
  ["100103061_11"]="Somehow, memories of all the events along the way flood her mind, her memories with Zero and Seer.",
  ["100103061_110"]="Qian will soon face a catastrophe that will engulf the entire Grandeur River Basin, and WeiShi won't have time to worry about the distant Eme-an.",
  ["100103061_111"]="You're making some serious progress. Do you need our assistance?",
  ["100103061_112"]="You're after the Cerulean Water, aren't you?",
  ["100103061_113"]="I don't need your assistance.",
  ["100103061_114"]="Sower's tone suddenly turns cold.",
  ["100103061_115"]="I believe I've made it clear that my condition for speaking with you here is that none of you, nor your clique, will ever take action against Qian.",
  ["100103061_116"]="Please refrain from testing my limits.",
  ["100103061_117"]="Hey, take it easy...",
  ["100103061_118"]="Erudito simply can't control his curiosity. We certainly all respect your wishes.",
  ["100103061_119"]="...",
  ["100103061_12"]="Even a variable beyond calculation is too fragile to change anything...",
  ["100103061_120"]="Let's get down to business.",
  ["100103061_121"]="It seems everything is in place.",
  ["100103061_122"]="You may proceed, Magnifico. I promise that the God of the Sun will be at your and Erudito's disposal once this is done.",
  ["100103061_123"]="All I need is an outcome.",
  ["100103061_124"]="There is a surprising softness in the usually emotionless mechanical voice",
  ["100103061_125"]="However, the order it issues is terrifying.",
  ["100103061_126"]="I need the downfall of the Beacon and Eme-an.",
  ["100103061_127"]="I only do what's within my paycheck.",
  ["100103061_128"]="Just to make myself clear, I'm responsible for retrieving the stuff, not fighting those monsters.",
  ["100103061_129"]="That's good enough.",
  ["100103061_13"]="Ereshan looks up and mutters.",
  ["100103061_130"]="I have faith in your ability to meet our expectations.",
  ["100103061_131"]="You may resume your tasks, ladies and gentlemen.",
  ["100103061_132"]="Silence fills the main seat, and no further words emanate from it.",
  ["100103061_133"]="One after another, the figures surrounding the round table fade away, until even the table and the space itself vanish in darkness.",
  ["100103061_134"]="The tower to heaven, standing for thousands of years.",
  ["100103061_135"]="Your downfall is nigh.",
  ["100103061_14"]="Nanna, I wouldn't be standing here if I could truly free my soul from its burden.",
  ["100103061_15"]="She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, and silently counts down the time until the final act.",
  ["100103061_16"]="Suddenly, she hears footsteps behind her.",
  ["100103061_17"]="The cautious, tentative footsteps carry the hesitance and confusion of someone new to this place.",
  ["100103061_18"]="Knowing who it is, Ereshan subdues all her emotions, opens her eyes, and slowly turns her head.",
  ["100103061_19"]="She looks upon the bewildered outlander before her, the corners of her mouth curling into a kind smile as she greets the stranger with a warm voice she wouldn't have imagined possible.",
  ["100103061_2"]="Hah... how ridiculous. Despite all those fancy words, here we are...",
  ["100103061_20"]="Ah, it's you, [BBNAME].",
  ["100103061_21"]="Suppressing all her emotions... concealing all her thoughts...",
  ["100103061_22"]="Having long accepted her destiny, she takes the final steps towards the predetermined future, embracing the \"first encounter\" with the fated person.",
  ["100103061_23"]="So, is this when we first met?",
  ["100103061_24"]="A flickering candle burns at the center of the round table.",
  ["100103061_25"]="The weak candlelight fails to illuminate the surroundings, getting consumed by the darkness before reaching the seated attendees.",
  ["100103061_26"]="The faces of all attendees remain hidden in the shadows. They could not see one another, nor was there any need to.",
  ["100103061_27"]="A round table is meant for a gathering where all attendees are equal, but a special chair stands at one end, towering over the others.",
  ["100103061_28"]="It stands noticeably taller than the rest, with its back directed towards the attendees, adorned with an ancient and solemn pattern.",
  ["100103061_29"]="The chair remains fixed in its position, never to be turned around, yet none of the attendees raise any objections, even if they are uncertain of who, if anyone, is sitting in that significant position.",
  ["100103061_3"]="Fitting... This is truly fitting.",
  ["100103061_30"]="Everyone within the shadows share a tacit acceptance.",
  ["100103061_31"]="The voice from the main seat breaks the silence, signaling the start of the meeting.",
  ["100103061_32"]="Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.",
  ["100103061_33"]="The voice emanating from the main seat is mechanical and synthesized, devoid of emotion or discernible gender.",
  ["100103061_34"]="In unison, they nod slightly in the direction of the main seat. Even though it will never face them, they know the gaze of the seat's owner encompasses everything.",
  ["100103061_35"]="All deeds have consequences. All debts must be paid.",
  ["100103061_36"]="A sigh escapes the mechanical voice.",
  ["100103061_37"]="It's been some time since we gathered like this.",
  ["100103061_38"]="I hope everyone has been successful in your endeavors.",
  ["100103061_39"]="I have called this meeting because the opportunity we've been waiting for has finally arrived.",
  ["100103061_4"]="The initial beam fades, and Aten momentarily returns to dormancy, descending from the air.",
  ["100103061_40"]="The mechanical voice pauses and then changes its tone.",
  ["100103061_41"]="I'm hearing the sound of the waves. Is that you, Drifter?",
  ["100103061_42"]="Soon, tapping sounds on the tabletop come from the speaker.",
  ["100103061_43"]="It is a code.",
  ["100103061_44"]="The translation of the code appears in front of Drifter's seat, replacing her words.",
  ["100103061_45"]="All eyes turn towards her.",
  ["100103061_46"]="Yeah.",
  ["100103061_47"]="The tappings of her knuckle resembles the echoes of the deep sea, long and lingering.",
  ["100103061_48"]="The lingering sound carry the echo of ocean waves, as if she were adrift in the middle of the ocean.",
  ["100103061_49"]="Can't dock.",
  ["100103061_5"]="Where the beam has passed, there are no signs of life.",
  ["100103061_50"]="You need faith, Drifter.",
  ["100103061_51"]="A voice of the aged resonates.",
  ["100103061_52"]="Faith reveals the homeward path and guides wanderers to their final destination.",
  ["100103061_53"]="His voice carries a faint melody and a touch of sanctity.",
  ["100103061_54"]="Thank you.",
  ["100103061_55"]="The translated message of thanks from the code appears on the projection.",
  ["100103061_56"]="But I refuse.",
  ["100103061_57"]="The figure known as \"Martyr\" tries to add something, but the mechanical voice interrupts him.",
  ["100103061_58"]="How is your plan progressing, Martyr?",
  ["100103061_59"]="Martyr stands up and bows slightly towards the main seat.",
  ["100103061_6"]="Ereshan walks to the spot Zero and [BBNAME] had been, looking down upon Aten.",
  ["100103061_60"]="The plan is proceeding well.",
  ["100103061_61"]="With the demise of the Lord of Blossoms, the courtyard is now without a leader, and they will soon choose a new one.",
  ["100103061_62"]="Power struggles have engulfed Japheth, leaving the new leader of Florentine fully occupied within this stream of chaos.",
  ["100103061_63"]="Although the house once controlled half of the empire's military might, now all commanders and generals are waiting for the turmoil to settle.",
  ["100103061_64"]="No one heeds the call of the young Duchess, and she has no spare time to concern herself with the events on the other side of the continent.",
  ["100103061_65"]="The mechanical voice expresses its approval of the news.",
  ["100103061_66"]="Your news always brings joy to those who hear it.",
  ["100103061_67"]="I'm destined to fulfill my mission.",
  ["100103061_68"]="Martyr bows once again before taking his seat.",
  ["100103061_69"]="Everything on land is progressing as scheduled, and our long-cherished vision is becoming a reality. It will become the wheel of steel that grinds everything in its path.",
  ["100103061_7"]="For millennia, humans have worshiped this machine, yet it remains unmoved by the carnage it inflicts. Aten emits a faint hum, preparing for its next surge of energy.",
  ["100103061_70"]="However, I wonder if things are progressing as well for us on the ocean, where the wheel doesn't work?",
  ["100103061_71"]="...",
  ["100103061_72"]="A scoff came from Martyr's seat.",
  ["100103061_73"]="After all, I heard that not too long ago, the so-called Queen of the High Seas surrendered the remnants of the anomaly beneath the Philistine Sea to someone else.",
  ["100103061_74"]="Drifter shows no signs of anger but simply withdraws her hand.",
  ["100103061_75"]="She clears her throat and starts speaking.",
  ["100103061_76"]="I met an interesting lady.",
  ["100103061_77"]="A young Eme-an. She made me an offer I couldn't refuse, or rather, we couldn't refuse.",
  ["100103061_78"]="She asked for the God of the Sun in exchange for the fall of the Tower of Babel.",
  ["100103061_79"]="What did you say? This meeting is not a stage for your nonsense.",
  ["100103061_8"]="This cold machine... does possess an indescribable divinity.",
  ["100103061_80"]="Drifter was telling the truth.",
  ["100103061_81"]="We did receive an offer from an Eme-an.",
  ["100103061_82"]="The God of the Sun will serve as our first Trojan Horse to dismantle C.A.V.E.",
  ["100103061_83"]="Are you ready, Magnifico?",
  ["100103061_84"]="The man who has remained silent in the shadows lifts his head.",
  ["100103061_85"]="Oh, yeah...",
  ["100103061_86"]="Finally, it's my turn, huh?",
  ["100103061_87"]="His voice is unprocessed, carrying the cheerful tone of a young male, laced with a hint of indolence that seems out of place.",
  ["100103061_88"]="Of course, I'm ready. I'm a professional, and the troops I hired have been positioned near that tower for quite a while now, just waiting for the signal to attack!",
  ["100103061_89"]="But before that, let's discuss how to split the spoils.",
  ["100103061_9"]="Ereshan knows with certainty that its next target would have been her, the one who awakened it.",
  ["100103061_90"]="Oh? What do you desire?",
  ["100103061_91"]="Well, I have no interest in the Library. As you know, the only good thing about me is my pragmatism.",
  ["100103061_92"]="The one thing I want has never changed: that magnetically confined fusion reactor.",
  ["100103061_93"]="I've already struck a deal with the Polestar military, and now I'm simply waiting for the promised goods.",
  ["100103061_94"]="Hyena.",
  ["100103061_95"]="Hey, why a personal attack all of a sudden?",
  ["100103061_96"]="You hold no reverence to the unknown. Sooner or later, your greed will be your downfall.",
  ["100103061_97"]="How can the God of the Sun fall into the hands of people like you?",
  ["100103061_98"]="Magnifico snorts.",
  ["100103061_99"]="If we truly held reverence for those things, we wouldn't be sitting at this table, plotting how to squeeze out their last ounce of value.",
  ["100103071_1"]="Brute force method",
  ["100103071_10"]="Why what? Why didn't I pursue Ereshan?",
  ["100103071_11"]="Because that would be futile. I should have realized earlier that the key point is not preventing the copper sphere from being activated because its activation is destined.",
  ["100103071_12"]="In the future that [BBNAME] foresaw, the copper sphere was activated but had not yet exploded, and there was nobody present to witness its detonation. Do you grasp what I'm implying, Shamash?",
  ["100103071_13"]="We thought we should stop Aten from being activated, but that's a typical misunderstanding.",
  ["100103071_14"]="What we should do is try to shut it down again once it's activated. It's a future that hasn't been seen, and it's our last hope.",
  ["100103071_15"]="The command.",
  ["100103071_16"]="It is true that only Ereshan knows the command, but there is no such thing as an unbreakable code.",
  ["100103071_17"]="All codes share a common enemy. No matter how complex and clever they may be, they will never withstand the most primitive and ungraceful yet also the most effective decryption method.",
  ["100103071_18"]="Brute force method.",
  ["100103071_19"]="With enough patience, I can eventually figure out the number of sand grains in every desert across the world.",
  ["100103071_2"]="At that moment, Nanna swiftly turns her head as if sensing something, and what she sees is Shamash slowly approaching her.",
  ["100103071_20"]="Given sufficient time, as long as I try them one by one, I can ultimately decipher all the codes in the world.",
  ["100103071_21"]="Such is the mathematical death sentence for all codes, and brute force method is the executioner.",
  ["100103071_22"]="It reminds me of something, you know?",
  ["100103071_23"]="Shamash remains silent, merely glancing around.",
  ["100103071_24"]="Exactly. It's similar to what this Library has been doing for millennia.",
  ["100103071_25"]="It lists an infinite number of possibilities based on a finite set of characters. Truth always exists in those infinite possibilities—it's just we haven't found it yet.",
  ["100103071_26"]="All we lack now is time.",
  ["100103071_27"]="The very purpose of cryptography is to delay the progress of decryption.",
  ["100103071_28"]="Through countless laborers and slaves, combined with unwavering determination and patience, the Memphians unraveled the command to activate Aten.",
  ["100103071_29"]="However, we don't have that much time or manpower.",
  ["100103071_3"]="There you are, Shamash.",
  ["100103071_30"]="Nonetheless, we're a few thousand years ahead of the Memphians.",
  ["100103071_31"]="During Akhenaten's era, people themselves were the basic computing units, using their fingers and brains to calculate.",
  ["100103071_32"]="But now, the most advanced computer in the world is right here in this part of the Babel Tower, and that's why I didn't pursue Ereshan but came here instead.",
  ["100103071_33"]="The central computer room.",
  ["100103071_34"]="Indeed.",
  ["100103071_35"]="These interconnected processing modules.",
  ["100103071_36"]="Insufficient.",
  ["100103071_37"]="Are you worried the computational power is still not enough?",
  ["100103071_38"]="Well, if we solely rely on the processing modules in the tower, it might not be sufficient.",
  ["100103071_39"]="But this is the Library of Babel.",
  ["100103071_4"]="Nanna.",
  ["100103071_40"]="It replicates all the rooms infinitely, which in turn, expands the size of our processing module rooms infinitely.",
  ["100103071_41"]="So, we'll combat infinity with infinity. We use the Library to achieve trillions of possibilities and achieve a feat that would take the Memphians eons to accomplish.",
  ["100103071_42"]="We'll connect all the extra processing modules, forming a processing network with ample computational power.",
  ["100103071_43"]="And leave the rest to brute force method.",
  ["100103071_44"]="Complex techniques are nothing in the face of raw power.",
  ["100103071_5"]="Both Nanna and Shamash remain remarkably calm despite the urgency of the situation.",
  ["100103071_6"]="Zero, pass on this message: \"The command is a palindrome.\"",
  ["100103071_7"]="I see... it was indeed the right decision to have you stay there.",
  ["100103071_8"]="Shamash steps up to Nanna.",
  ["100103071_9"]="You've discovered it. Why?",
  ["100103112_10"]="It explores possibilities even more than that.",
  ["100103112_11"]="It has only seconds to work with, but it's dealing with trillions of possible symbol combinations.",
  ["100103112_12"]="A flood of endless possibilities courses through its efficient arithmetic core, much like the ancient people of Memphis chanted in a language they did not comprehend.",
  ["100103112_13"]="Somewhere within that torrent, there must be a command that harnesses the ancient sun.",
  ["100103112_14"]="Worked?",
  ["100103112_15"]="If you're talking about getting a full list of all possible combinations, it worked.",
  ["100103112_16"]="However, if you're talking about finding the specific one to deactivate Aten...",
  ["100103112_17"]="Verification.",
  ["100103112_18"]="Exactly, that's the most challenging part.",
  ["100103112_19"]="Every possible word, phrase, and chapter now reside within this computational network.",
  ["100103112_2"]="As the final beep of the processing modules echoes, the room is plunged into an eerie silence.",
  ["100103112_20"]="But how are we supposed to find that specific command?",
  ["100103112_21"]="If we recite all the commands, one must deactivate Aten.",
  ["100103112_22"]="But Aten is not here, and there are only the two of us. Can we really recite all the commands before we die of old age?",
  ["100103112_23"]="How can we quickly send all these commands to Aten to check if they're correct?",
  ["100103112_24"]="...",
  ["100103112_25"]="Gosh, Cosmos, you've left behind quite a mess. What were you thinking?",
  ["100103112_26"]="Hmm? Hold on a sec.",
  ["100103112_27"]="At that moment, Nanna suddenly remembers something.",
  ["100103112_28"]="When you face a problem that you can't solve, use it, Nanna.",
  ["100103112_29"]="She takes out the seal.",
  ["100103112_3"]="Something has changed.",
  ["100103112_30"]="Critical moment... This is the critical moment. What am I supposed to do with your legacy?",
  ["100103112_31"]="Shamash takes the ancient seal directly from Nanna's hand and plugs one end into the port of the control center.",
  ["100103112_32"]="What are you doing? The port doesn't even match...",
  ["100103112_33"]="Nanna's words trail off.",
  ["100103112_34"]="The end of the seal, originally solid, starts to change its shape as if it were fluid.",
  ["100103112_35"]="This is...",
  ["100103112_36"]="Miraculously, the end of the seal smoothly fits into the port of the processing module.",
  ["100103112_37"]="The products of ancient craftsmanship and modern industrial standards meld seamlessly, concealing how the solid seal underwent such a transformation.",
  ["100103112_38"]="It is as if someone has designed it precisely for plugging into a machine that would be created in the distant future.",
  ["100103112_4"]="It feels as if an immense entity has finally taken form.",
  ["100103112_5"]="As if all the screws of an enormous machine are finally tightened securely.",
  ["100103112_6"]="Unfathomable calculations, surpassing human comprehension, start to unfold.",
  ["100103112_7"]="It's massive and intricate, yet surprisingly simple.",
  ["100103112_8"]="Its entire purpose is dedicated to one task: brute force.",
  ["100103112_9"]="Grains of dust scattered across the vast wilderness. A tiny droplet in the immense ocean. Countless stars twinkling in the Milky Way.",
  ["100103121_1"]="Across the Dark Night",
  ["100103121_10"]="As my senses gradually return, the first thing I smell is a strong smell of blood. It almost makes me vomit.",
  ["100103121_100"]="Please be quiet.",
  ["100103121_101"]="Chirp!",
  ["100103121_11"]="My skin feels sticky where it touches the ground.",
  ["100103121_12"]="I find myself in a pool of blood, but I don't feel any pain.",
  ["100103121_13"]="What exactly happened?",
  ["100103121_14"]="Oh, right. We failed to stop Ereshan, and she activated Aten.",
  ["100103121_15"]="We were struck by Aten, and then... what?",
  ["100103121_16"]="*cough*",
  ["100103121_17"]="*cough* *cough*",
  ["100103121_18"]="A faint cough, as subtle as a mosquito's buzz, sounds near my ear, instantly jolting me awake.",
  ["100103121_19"]="...",
  ["100103121_2"]="Across the Dark Night",
  ["100103121_20"]="...",
  ["100103121_21"]="Then, the horrifying scene in front of my eyes grips my throat.",
  ["100103121_22"]="That's when I realize.",
  ["100103121_23"]="The blood on my clothes isn't mine, it's Zero's.",
  ["100103121_24"]="The sanguine puddle spreading from beneath the girl resembles a crimson flower, blooming with her as the center.",
  ["100103121_25"]="Like a flower that fades soon after it blooms, she too is withering away.",
  ["100103121_26"]="Such injury would make any surgeon shake their head in despair.",
  ["100103121_27"]="There isn't a single piece of intact skin on the body, and white shards of bone protrude through the bloody flesh.",
  ["100103121_28"]="Certain death awaits her.",
  ["100103121_29"]="Despite her miserable state, she doesn't appear wretched.",
  ["100103121_3"]="Once again, the chaotic world slowly began to lighten up.",
  ["100103121_30"]="Instead, there is an eerie beauty about her.",
  ["100103121_31"]="...",
  ["100103121_32"]="*cough*",
  ["100103121_33"]="She coughs again. Each cough brings forth blood and viscera from her mouth.",
  ["100103121_34"]="Her breathing is feeble and fragile, as if it may stop at any moment.",
  ["100103121_35"]="However, her face remains expressionless.",
  ["100103121_36"]="There is no pain or despair.",
  ["100103121_37"]="She is serene as ever, as if the pieces falling apart are not hers.",
  ["100103121_38"]="Having sensed my presence, her golden eyes flicker open, bright and alert amidst the wreckage of her form.",
  ["100103121_39"]="She looks at me in silence.",
  ["100103121_4"]="It feels like a long dream, yet when I am awakened, the memory within the dream fades away.",
  ["100103121_40"]="You... *cough*",
  ["100103121_41"]="She wants to say something, but her words are drowned out by another surge of blood.",
  ["100103121_42"]="I rush forward, leaning down to catch her words.",
  ["100103121_43"]="Get away... from this place...",
  ["100103121_44"]="With great effort, she manages to utter those words.",
  ["100103121_45"]="As these words leave her lips, her hands go limp, and her eyelids close once again.",
  ["100103121_46"]="However, her chest continues to rise and fall—she has only lost consciousness.",
  ["100103121_47"]="I stand up and start checking my surroundings.",
  ["100103121_48"]="The space is crumbling in a way that defied physics, its edges fading into a golden glow.",
  ["100103121_49"]="This space is falling apart.",
  ["100103121_5"]="(Open my eyes.)",
  ["100103121_50"]="As I come to this realization, a sense of unease washes over me once again.",
  ["100103121_51"]="Unlike the previous discomfort of being observed, the feeling of imminent danger is so palpable that I instinctively scan my surroundings.",
  ["100103121_52"]="Dark shadows stir in the dim corners.",
  ["100103121_53"]="I must get out of here.",
  ["100103121_54"]="With that in mind, I crouch down.",
  ["100103121_55"]="Carrying Zero on my back, I struggle through the debris.",
  ["100103121_56"]="She is incredibly light, almost weightless.",
  ["100103121_57"]="Perhaps it is because her life is slipping away with every second.",
  ["100103121_58"]="My back burns, and I can't discern whether it is from her warm blood or my sweat.",
  ["100103121_59"]="Carrying her around on my back without proper medical attention might worsen her injuries, but I don't have time to think about that now.",
  ["100103121_6"]="What comes into my view is a fragmented world.",
  ["100103121_60"]="In such a dire situation, I have no clue where I should be heading. In the end, I simply let my instincts lead me in one direction.",
  ["100103121_61"]="Occasionally, I can feel her shallow breath against the skin of my neck, a faint and sluggish rhythm assuring me that she is still alive.",
  ["100103121_62"]="...",
  ["100103121_63"]="This fact brings me some comfort.",
  ["100103121_64"]="At that moment, an itch tickles the back of my neck.",
  ["100103121_65"]="A plump bird appears out of nowhere.",
  ["100103121_66"]="Wait, you're still alive?!",
  ["100103121_67"]="You've come back to life?!",
  ["100103121_68"]="Chirp!",
  ["100103121_69"]="Anchirp gives me an angry peck.",
  ["100103121_7"]="Streams of data transform into shimmering specters, and shattered alloy plates float in the air.",
  ["100103121_70"]="Its beak is surprisingly hard, making me worry about the state of my brain.",
  ["100103121_71"]="Meanwhile, its noisy chirps gradually turn into something understandable in the midst of my confused thoughts.",
  ["100103121_72"]="Chirp chirp chirp... Where do you think you're going?! Hey, you're headed the wrong way, you idiot! Not there!",
  ["100103121_73"]="Hmm...",
  ["100103121_74"]="(Ignore the hallucination.)",
  ["100103121_75"]="(Follow Anchirp's instructions.)",
  ["100103121_76"]="Keep going that way, and I'll peck your brains out! You can hear me, right? Did you do that on purpose? Thinking you're superior to me or something?!",
  ["100103121_77"]="Upon dodging its second attack with ease, I realize that the voice in my head is not my imagination. Somehow, this resurrected bird is communicating with me telepathically.",
  ["100103121_78"]="(I feel annoyed having tacit understanding with a bird.)",
  ["100103121_79"]="(I feel surreal having tacit understanding with a bird.)",
  ["100103121_8"]="Everything appears to be slowly disappearing, like objects dissolving in a liquid.",
  ["100103121_80"]="What's with that face? Besides Zero, you're the only one who understands me! Shouldn't you feel honored?",
  ["100103121_81"]="You're going the wrong way! Get back here now, or you'll end up in the Unknown Sector!",
  ["100103121_82"]="I follow its instructions this time.",
  ["100103121_83"]="You're a quick learner! Not bad at all!",
  ["100103121_84"]="How come I can understand you?",
  ["100103121_85"]="Why are you still alive?",
  ["100103121_86"]="What are you talking about? Didn't we... Huh? Oh, yeah, you're right. Why can you suddenly understand me? Is this some sort of revelation, maybe?",
  ["100103121_87"]="It's not only noisy, but it's also pretty dumb.",
  ["100103121_88"]="While a paper cutter can shred a dictionary into pieces, it can't harm the language itself. That's how Zero would explain this situation, I daresay!",
  ["100103121_89"]="This bird is not only noisy, but also talks in a rather abstract manner.",
  ["100103121_9"]="Numerous questions fill my mind, but the situation prevents me from trying to piece together the events that have happened.",
  ["100103121_90"]="(Give up on trying to understand its words.)",
  ["100103121_91"]="Zero told me not to chatter in her ear, so I stayed quiet.",
  ["100103121_92"]="But now that Zero is asleep, I guess it's okay for me to say something, right? Besides, I'm not a chatterbox at all, wouldn't you agree?!",
  ["100103121_93"]="Anyway, just follow me, you knucklehead. You don't even know where you were knocked down from. Gosh, if not for me, you'd probably be lost here forever!",
  ["100103121_94"]="I'm obligated to protect you until Zero wakes up! That's what Zero told me! What else can I do? I'm her most faithful bird partner after all!",
  ["100103121_95"]="Seriously, I don't understand why Zero favors you so much! If she had left you behind back then, she wouldn't have made such a mess of herself.",
  ["100103121_96"]="She summoned me to stop that beam! That's really too much for this cute bird! Shouldn't a cute bird like me be well protected and cherished?",
  ["100103121_97"]="Oops, I'm not complaining. By the way, don't tell Zero what I just said! She'll get mad if she finds out I said all that stuff.",
  ["100103121_98"]="Or perhaps you can just pretend you can't understand me at all! Otherwise, she might never allow me to speak in front of you again! That kid can be even crueler than Ere.",
  ["100103121_99"]="Alright, just be quiet.",
  ["100103131_1"]="The Last Hope",
  ["100103131_10"]="She hears herself asking the other person.",
  ["100103131_11"]="I'm going beyond the cave to see... the real sun.",
  ["100103131_12"]="The real sun?",
  ["100103131_13"]="She wants to ask what the real sun is, but all that comes out is...",
  ["100103131_14"]="Will we meet again?",
  ["100103131_15"]="Yes, we will.",
  ["100103131_16"]="Remember, any destiny, no matter how long and complex, is only reflected in a single moment—the moment when you realize who you truly are.",
  ["100103131_17"]="This is true for the outlander and for you, too.",
  ["100103131_18"]="When both of you realize who you truly are, we will meet again.",
  ["100103131_19"]="She opens her eyes and then recognizes the person who is carrying her.",
  ["100103131_2"]="She has a very long dream.",
  ["100103131_20"]="The wound stretching from her chest to her abdomen, exposed to the air, rubs against the carrier's back, causing constant pain that gradually clears her blurred consciousness.",
  ["100103131_21"]="...",
  ["100103131_22"]="Just as she is about to speak, the intensified pain makes her involuntarily inhale.",
  ["100103131_23"]="Tickled by the disrupted breathing, the person carrying her feels an itch on the neck and instinctively flinches.",
  ["100103131_24"]="However, the person has not noticed her awakening and continues moving forward.",
  ["100103131_25"]="...",
  ["100103131_26"]="She knows she should tell the person that she is awake, but for some reason, she chooses to remain silent.",
  ["100103131_27"]="The shoulders carrying her are not bony, but not muscular either.",
  ["100103131_28"]="And she, unable to move, has to put all her weight on that back.",
  ["100103131_29"]="Having lost all her composure, she is overwhelmed by such an awkward and pitiful situation.",
  ["100103131_3"]="Zero, you will meet someone in the near future.",
  ["100103131_30"]="More importantly, she doesn't know how to start a conversation in this position.",
  ["100103131_31"]="At least, she needs to straighten her back first.",
  ["100103131_32"]="With that thought in mind, she makes her first attempt.",
  ["100103131_33"]="...",
  ["100103131_34"]="Unable to hold back, a soft cry of pain escapes her lips.",
  ["100103131_35"]="Finally, even the unresponsive person beneath her realizes that she has awakened.",
  ["100103131_36"]="Zero?",
  ["100103131_37"]="I attempt to call out that girl's name.",
  ["100103131_38"]="A moment later, I receive a faint response from her.",
  ["100103131_39"]="Why...?",
  ["100103131_4"]="You will meet an outlander who once basked in the sunlight but chose to descend into the depths of the caves.",
  ["100103131_40"]="...",
  ["100103131_41"]="Didn't I tell you... to leave...?",
  ["100103131_42"]="Her abrupt question leaves me confused.",
  ["100103131_43"]="But I am leaving, right?",
  ["100103131_44"]="I don't know where to go.",
  ["100103131_45"]="Well.",
  ["100103131_46"]="The sigh feels like a freshly fallen snowflake, cool yet soft. It is hard to determine if the sigh stems from regret or some other indescribable emotion.",
  ["100103131_47"]="After a while, she has stabllized her breathing and speaks again.",
  ["100103131_48"]="I'm sorry...",
  ["100103131_49"]="Before I can say anything, Zero's voice comes from behind once again.",
  ["100103131_5"]="This outlander comes from the outside and knows nothing of the cave. Naturally, they will be confused about their situation. You must guide and protect them.",
  ["100103131_50"]="Although I told you that you had the right to regret, that's not the truth.",
  ["100103131_51"]="The director... no, Cosmos... he told me that I must keep whoever holds the pendant safe.",
  ["100103131_52"]="So... if you had rejected my request back then, I would have erased your memory... not only the memory of being here.",
  ["100103131_53"]="But also my memories about before I came to this tower.",
  ["100103131_54"]="...",
  ["100103131_55"]="I don't know how to respond that.",
  ["100103131_56"]="Sometimes when I look back at it all, I find it hard to believe myself.",
  ["100103131_57"]="Why did I insist on joining the organization? Why did I accept everything supernatural as it is, without ever questioning it?",
  ["100103131_58"]="Perhaps my long silence makes Zero misunderstand my mood.",
  ["100103131_59"]="Are you... angry?",
  ["100103131_6"]="This is your mission. From the moment you meet your fated person, your blank life will start getting its meaning.",
  ["100103131_60"]="For the first time, she asks about my feelings, rather than objective facts like whether I am well or not.",
  ["100103131_61"]="No.",
  ["100103131_62"]="Yeah, I am angry.",
  ["100103131_63"]="Please don't talk.",
  ["100103131_64"]="You have every right to be angry.",
  ["100103131_65"]="It's only natural to be angry when you've been lied to.",
  ["100103131_66"]="Are you angry, too?",
  ["100103131_67"]="She quickly understands what I am implying.",
  ["100103131_68"]="...",
  ["100103131_69"]="I don't know.",
  ["100103131_7"]="While an inevitable destiny might sound like a burden, you can think of this fated encounter as a romantic tale and look forward to it.",
  ["100103131_70"]="Then let's not dwell on such things.",
  ["100103131_71"]="...",
  ["100103131_72"]="It's only natural to be angry when you've been lied to.",
  ["100103131_73"]="She closes her eyes.",
  ["100103131_74"]="...",
  ["100103131_75"]="Silence envelopes us once again.",
  ["100103131_76"]="I don't know how much time has passed.",
  ["100103131_77"]="Anchirp, who has been silent since Zero woke up, trying to remain unnoticed, suddenly chirps.",
  ["100103131_78"]="I look up, and the surroundings finally start to make sense.",
  ["100103131_79"]="Not far ahead is the platform where Zero and I were before getting knocked into the air.",
  ["100103131_8"]="That's all I have to say. Now, I must depart.",
  ["100103131_80"]="And it is also the place where Ereshan bid her final farewell to me.",
  ["100103131_81"]="Let me down.",
  ["100103131_82"]="Hold on...",
  ["100103131_83"]="Despite my plea, the lady breaks free of my arms and lands gracefully on the ground.",
  ["100103131_84"]="Zero?",
  ["100103131_85"]="I'm fine.",
  ["100103131_86"]="She waves her hand, stopping me from approaching her.",
  ["100103131_87"]="...",
  ["100103131_88"]="Zero, who just rolled down from my back, still looks weak.",
  ["100103131_89"]="Strangely enough, the wounds on her body are regenerating at an incredible rate.",
  ["100103131_9"]="Where are you going?",
  ["100103131_90"]="Her newly formed skin is smooth without any scars.",
  ["100103131_91"]="This is definitely not how a human heals in any situation.",
  ["100103131_92"]="While her footwork was a bit unsteady when she first landed on the ground, her gait becomes smoother and more confident with each step.",
  ["100103131_93"]="She straightens her back as her slender fingers smooth out the messy hem of her skirt.",
  ["100103131_94"]="Your wounds...",
  ["100103131_95"]="My body possesses a special property.",
  ["100103131_96"]="She looks away, indicating that she doesn't want to give more details, so I decide not to press further.",
  ["100103131_97"]="It's not safe ahead. Follow me.",
  ["100103152_1"]="Once again, the ripples caused by the time distortion spread through the surrounding space, making the remnants of bookshelves and sculptures tremble.",
  ["100103152_10"]="Despite only having half of its body remaining, the giant chases after us relentlessly.",
  ["100103152_11"]="With its arms, it crawls forward in hot pursuit.",
  ["100103152_2"]="Deep within the ruins, a mutilated yet massive statue slowly rises up.",
  ["100103152_3"]="It is none other than Darius, who lost its lower body in the previous battle and fell on the ground.",
  ["100103152_4"]="Having been dormant in this area for an unknown period, it has grown incredibly large after devouring countless things.",
  ["100103152_5"]="Unlike Ereshan, who can only vaguely sense our presence, Darius immediately locks its gaze on us.",
  ["100103152_6"]="You filthy insects!!!",
  ["100103152_7"]="You again?!",
  ["100103152_8"]="You just won't give up, will you?!",
  ["100103152_9"]="Let's go.",
  ["100103161_1"]="The Nine Billion Names of God",
  ["100103161_10"]="Too fast.",
  ["100103161_11"]="After a brief moment of thought, Nanna figures out the reason.",
  ["100103161_12"]="So, that's why...",
  ["100103161_13"]="The screen displays information that relies on the brightness of countless pixels.",
  ["100103161_14"]="Now, after a pixel lights up, the next code that requires it to be lit immediately follows without waiting for it to dim.",
  ["100103161_15"]="The blinks of pixels can no longer keep up with the torrent of code streaming by.",
  ["100103161_16"]="Therefore, all that is displayed is a blinding white.",
  ["100103161_17"]="The validation has begun.",
  ["100103161_18"]="Overhead, without any fuss, the stars are going out.",
  ["100103161_2"]="Miraculously, the end of the seal smoothly fits into the port of the processing module.",
  ["100103161_3"]="The products of ancient craftsmanship and modern industrial standards meld seamlessly, concealing how the solid seal underwent such a transformation.",
  ["100103161_4"]="It is as if someone has designed it precisely for plugging into a machine that would be created in the distant future.",
  ["100103161_5"]="The screen flickers for a moment, and the lines on the screen start moving again.",
  ["100103161_6"]="What happened?",
  ["100103161_7"]="In an instant, all the commands and letters vanish. The large screen lights up completely, creating a blinding white radiance.",
  ["100103161_8"]="What happened? Is it down?",
  ["100103161_9"]="No.",
  ["100103171_1"]="The Descending Sun",
  ["100103171_10"]="There is no turning back, and the bridge ahead is broken.",
  ["100103171_11"]="Prepare yourself.",
  ["100103171_2"]="The view opens up through an archway.",
  ["100103171_3"]="A long, broken bridge stretches across the abyss, leading to a giant black pillar.",
  ["100103171_4"]="The cylindrical space stretches infinitely to the top and bottom, composed of hexagonal walls covered in countless arches, with millions of bridges extending from the arches connecting to the black Beacon.",
  ["100103171_5"]="An unknown source of light illuminates the entire space, except for the dull surface of the Beacon, as if declaring its otherworldly origin.",
  ["100103171_6"]="Just casting a glance downward is dizzying, while looking upward reveals the shadows cast by numerous bridges and arches akin to a forest.",
  ["100103171_7"]="Everything signifies that this is the source of the Library of Babel, the beginning of eternity and infinity.",
  ["100103171_8"]="However, at this moment, eternity itself is as fragile as mortality.",
  ["100103171_9"]="The roar of the giant comes from behind.",
  ["100103172_1"]="A peculiar ripple emanates from Zero's wand.",
  ["100103172_10"]="The blazing sun that once razed Ehtaton to the ground, the plague that once set Ephrathah ablaze, lights up once more in the depths of the Library of Babel.",
  ["100103172_100"]="However, the silhouette is unmistakable.",
  ["100103172_101"]="Zero's pupils contract dramatically.",
  ["100103172_102"]="What she sees is none other than the giant that attacked me when I first entered the tower and supposedly got obliterated by Zero.",
  ["100103172_103"]="The giant, with only half of its head remaining, looks in our direction.",
  ["100103172_104"]="It wears a vengeful grimace, mixed with a sense of relief from finally achieving its revenge.",
  ["100103172_105"]="It encountered us two and a half thousand years ago and had its lower half destroyed by us two thousand years ago...",
  ["100103172_106"]="After arriving here, pursuing our shadows, it has waited alone for two thousand years before finally embracing another encounter with its foes...",
  ["100103172_107"]="Its revenge, spanning thousands of years, now reaches its climax at this moment.",
  ["100103172_108"]="jjjtntnjtn jjtnjjjj jjjtnjtntn jjtnjjjj jjjtntnjtn!!!",
  ["100103172_109"]="The spell dissipates, and the characters surrounding the ancient sun quickly fade away.",
  ["100103172_11"]="However, that is not the end.",
  ["100103172_110"]="The radiance on Aten dims. At that moment, the lines on its surface resemble embers, emitting an eerie hue.",
  ["100103172_111"]="Like a dying breath, the enormous sphere begins to collapse inward.",
  ["100103172_112"]="Zero immediately reacts and starts to repeat the command.",
  ["100103172_113"]="jjjtntnjtn!!",
  ["100103172_114"]="However, it is too late.",
  ["100103172_115"]="The lines crumble, and the light dissipates.",
  ["100103172_116"]="Before a dying star meets its demise, its thick plasma atmosphere free-falls towards its core under the force of gravity. This is what happened, is happening, and will happen to Aten.",
  ["100103172_117"]="Its mass continues to compress, its shell converging to its limits until, finally, there is a momentary pause.",
  ["100103172_118"]="Inside the ancient nuclear reactor, the atomic structure shatters, and unfathomable energy violently smashes the confinement that has lasted for thousands of years.",
  ["100103172_119"]="It is as if a supernova is erupting.",
  ["100103172_12"]="... j, tn, tn, j, j, j, tn...",
  ["100103172_120"]="Surges of light and heat flood the entire realm like an ocean.",
  ["100103172_121"]="Well, let me tell you a story.",
  ["100103172_122"]="A story about the sun.",
  ["100103172_123"]="Once, there were prisoners who had been living in a cave, bound and facing the cave wall since they were children.",
  ["100103172_124"]="They couldn't turn back, see the exit of the cave, see themselves, or see the other prisoners.",
  ["100103172_125"]="For the rest of their lives, all they could see was the wall in front of them.",
  ["100103172_126"]="Beyond the cave, the sun shone brightly, and its rays illuminated everything.",
  ["100103172_127"]="The objects outside the cave, favored by the sun, cast their shadows on the walls of the cave.",
  ["100103172_128"]="The prisoners saw these moving shadows, mistaking them for real creatures.",
  ["100103172_129"]="They believed that those shadows constituted the real world.",
  ["100103172_13"]="...tn, tn, tn, j, tn, j, j...",
  ["100103172_130"]="They even devised a set of laws for the movements of these shadows, predicting what was to come.",
  ["100103172_131"]="One day, however, these prisoners broke free and walked into the world beyond the cave.",
  ["100103172_132"]="What do you think will happen...",
  ["100103172_133"]="When these prisoners finally see the real sun?",
  ["100103172_134"]="You don't need to answer my question.",
  ["100103172_135"]="Once you leave this place, you will forget this conversation with me.",
  ["100103172_136"]="But it doesn't matter because you will witness everything with your own eyes.",
  ["100103172_137"]="You will encounter those prisoners, and you will see the real sun.",
  ["100103172_138"]="We will meet again at some distant point in the future.",
  ["100103172_139"]="Farewell, outlander.",
  ["100103172_14"]="... j, tn, j, tn, j, tn, j...",
  ["100103172_140"]="...",

  ["100103172_15"]="Countless characters have encircled the searing light of Aten.",
  ["100103172_16"]="The characters flow unceasingly, as if they were the mighty river of Memphis.",
  ["100103172_17"]="Little by little, drop by drop, the characters merge into a magnificent waterfall that rushes down in an instant.",
  ["100103172_18"]="What happened in the past is once again reflected in the present.",
  ["100103172_19"]="The united prayers from the people of Memphis, and the infinite divine words generated by the processing modules.",
  ["100103172_2"]="It is a vortex formed by glowing characters.",
  ["100103172_20"]="Vocabulary, phrases, dictionaries, great books, enough to consume the lives of millions of mortals if recited by mouth, whirl through the infinite rooms of the Library of Babel.",
  ["100103172_21"]="The chants from the people thousands of years ago are echoing loudly.",
  ["100103172_22"]="There is always a command that harnesses the god.",
  ["100103172_23"]="Suddenly, all incantations stand still.",
  ["100103172_24"]="And with it comes a silence as if time stands still.",
  ["100103172_25"]="Amidst of the silence, the light in front of my eyes gradually dissipates on an ebbing tide.",
  ["100103172_26"]="Space, matter, and distinct forms, one by one, return to my vision.",
  ["100103172_27"]="The enormous copper sphere is levitating in the air.",
  ["100103172_28"]="The rotating characters of the last command remain undissolved, as if they are planets circling the ancient sun.",
  ["100103172_29"]="jjjtntnjtn jjtnjjjj jjjtnjtntn jjtnjjjj jjjtntnjtn.",
  ["100103172_3"]="The Library is listing and outputting all possible commands.",
  ["100103172_30"]="Bounded by the elusive divine words, the god of unknown creation is shackled.",
  ["100103172_31"]="Verification successful. Aten has... stopped...",
  ["100103172_32"]="At that moment, I finally understand why Sarvis was so joyful when he met us for the second time.",
  ["100103172_33"]="This must be the same scene as when the Star of Ephrathah was finally extinguished.",
  ["100103172_34"]="Some tiny rustling echoes, breaking the silence.",
  ["100103172_35"]="It is as though time, which has remained still for so long, has begun to flow again.",
  ["100103172_36"]="I look up in the direction of the sound.",
  ["100103172_37"]="Incredibly high above, there is dust falling against the light.",
  ["100103172_38"]="No, it is not dust.",
  ["100103172_39"]="Rather, it is the ever-disintegrating fragments of the battered Library, made small only by the fact that they are so far away.",
  ["100103172_4"]="Surrounded by the infinite characters, Aten's movements are stagnated for a moment.",
  ["100103172_40"]="Soon, the broken walls start falling like a torrential downpour, and the space itself starts to tremble.",
  ["100103172_41"]="This realm is about to reach its limit.",
  ["100103172_42"]="In merely a few moments, knowledge accumulated from thousands of years, all those truths, lies, and prophecies that will never be actualized...",
  ["100103172_43"]="Along with the vastness of texts generated by the Library itself, countless volumes that have never been read from their creation to extinction, will be sinking together into eternal oblivion.",
  ["100103172_44"]="It is said that all things will become clear before one dies.",
  ["100103172_45"]="Now, Darius Hystaspes knows this to be true.",
  ["100103172_46"]="Who am I?",
  ["100103172_47"]="He examines himself in confusion, and all that comes into its view is a mutilated body.",
  ["100103172_48"]="Why am I here?",
  ["100103172_49"]="He looks around in confusion, as a myriad of things he knows so well and yet seem so strange are falling alongside him.",
  ["100103172_5"]="But the next moment, it aims it muzzle directly at us.",
  ["100103172_50"]="Where am I going?",
  ["100103172_51"]="Nothing but silence envelops the world.",
  ["100103172_52"]="Gazing into the bottomless abyss ahead of him, he suddenly realizes that is the end of his long journey, the inevitable end of his destiny.",
  ["100103172_53"]="Death.",
  ["100103172_54"]="Then everything becomes clear.",
  ["100103172_55"]="He recalls everything.",
  ["100103172_56"]="He is Hystaspes Darius.",
  ["100103172_57"]="He was the son of King Hystaspes, the most prominent figure in the court of Obed.",
  ["100103172_58"]="He was the Emperor Darius, the ruler of the vast Land of the Roaring Lion.",
  ["100103172_59"]="He was the King of All Kings, whose remarkable achievements had been witnessed by the magnificent waterfalls of Memphis.",
  ["100103172_6"]="Instantly, the blazing radiance swallows all my senses and sears directly into my retinas.",
  ["100103172_60"]="He was the master of the ancient sun, although it had never yielded to his command.",
  ["100103172_61"]="However, three Eme-ans claiming to be from two and a half thousand years later deceived him, extracting the secrets of divine words.",
  ["100103172_62"]="Because of those Eme-ans, he lost his throne, his warriors, his army, and ultimately his dignity as a king.",
  ["100103172_63"]="Because of those Eme-ans, he lost his throne, his warriors, his army, and ultimately his dignity as a king.",
  ["100103172_64"]="Because of those Eme-ans, he lost his throne, his warriors, his army, and ultimately his dignity as a king.",
  ["100103172_65"]="Because of those Eme-ans, he lost his throne, his warriors, his army, and ultimately his dignity as a king.",
  ["100103172_66"]="After waiting agonizingly for hundreds of years, he encountered those deceivers once again, only to be crippled by them, relying solely on his hands for mobility.",
  ["100103172_67"]="After waiting agonizingly for hundreds of years, he encountered those deceivers once again, only to be crippled by them, relying solely on his hands for mobility.",
  ["100103172_68"]="After waiting agonizingly for hundreds of years, he encountered those deceivers once again, only to be crippled by them, relying solely on his hands for mobility.",
  ["100103172_69"]="Somehow, these deceivers quickly returned to meet him for a third time.",
  ["100103172_7"]="However, I feel no pain at all.",
  ["100103172_70"]="He followed them, arriving at the location of the black monolith.",
  ["100103172_71"]="Upon reflection, he realized that the monolith was likely the origin of the tower, the only thing befitting such a miracle.",
  ["100103172_72"]="Then, fate whimsically turned the Library upside down and flung it to a distant module, undergoing a complete reversion.",
  ["100103172_73"]="There, he endured a prolonged existence.",
  ["100103172_74"]="No longer could he traverse the battlefield with swift movements, chasing his prey like the Lion of Obed.",
  ["100103172_75"]="His crippled body confined his soul like a prison.",
  ["100103172_76"]="However, he would never forgive those deceivers.",
  ["100103172_77"]="Despite his losses, he still possessed patience, intuition, and instinct.",
  ["100103172_78"]="Time was on his side. Since those deceivers claimed to be from thousands of years in the future, he was willing to wait for thousands of years.",
  ["100103172_79"]="He would wait until their birth, their tenure as Eme-ans, their arrival at the Library of Babel, their deceptions through countless ages, and every encounter they had with him.",
  ["100103172_8"]="It's as though my nerves have been burned to ashes before any signal can reach my brain.",
  ["100103172_80"]="Eventually, the Wheel of Fortune would bring them back to him for a final encounter.",
  ["100103172_81"]="During his confinement, the passage of time was immeasurable, or perhaps the very concept of time eluded him.",
  ["100103172_82"]="During his eternal expedition, pain and hatred became increasingly clear in his mind.",
  ["100103172_83"]="Fortunately, fate was merciful enough to reunite him with the deceivers for the fourth time where it all began.",
  ["100103172_84"]="Finally, he reaches their time, two and a half thousand years later.",
  ["100103172_85"]="What an extraordinary achievement! Darius, the King of All Kings, has triumphed over time itself!",
  ["100103172_86"]="However, it feels as if they are meeting him for the first time.",
  ["100103172_87"]="Is this actually their first encounter with him?",
  ["100103172_88"]="Nevertheless, he shall never forgive them, even if they are unaware of everything that happens later.",
  ["100103172_89"]="A swift death would be too merciful. Those vile wretches must be subjected to the fear of dying before their actual deaths.",
  ["100103172_9"]="Zero becomes a tiny silhouette in the depths of the radiance and then gets swallowed up.",
  ["100103172_90"]="Therefore, fueled by his hatred, he tightly grips one of the deceivers and flings them into the air.",
  ["100103172_91"]="But how does he end up in such a miserable state? Previously, he had his upper half of the body intact, and now only his head remains.",
  ["100103172_92"]="Then he realizes the bitter truth.",
  ["100103172_93"]="Once again, he suffered a humiliating defeat, succumbing to the brazen deceivers.",
  ["100103172_94"]="Everything he once possessed and everything he once desired crumbles along with the Library of Babel.",
  ["100103172_95"]="The King of All Kings stares into the abyss of emptiness.",
  ["100103172_96"]="There is no starry sky he once desired, only darkness that engulfs him.",
  ["100103172_97"]="Then, he witnesses the final reward from fate at long last...",
  ["100103172_98"]="A remarkably large piece of debris sweeps past. It was once the floor of a room.",
  ["100103172_99"]="And then a figure, distorted like everything else, catches his attention.",
  ["100103181_1"]="The Downfall of the Tower",
  ["100103181_10"]="Night after night, day after day.",
  ["100103181_11"]="He covered every corner of the Fertile Crescent but found no sign of the god.",
  ["100103181_12"]="Disheartened, the scholar aborted his journey and set out for home.",
  ["100103181_13"]="And then...",
  ["100103181_14"]="On his way back, he witnessed a shocking black shadow stretched across the center of his path.",
  ["100103181_15"]="From a distance, it looked like a long black needle, piercing through heaven and earth and sewing the world into one.",
  ["100103181_16"]="Upon closer inspection, the long needle appeared even more magnificent than he had imagined, resembling a black monolith.",
  ["100103181_17"]="The monolith is incredibly smooth yet devoid of any shine, resembling a piece of mirrored night, blending the contrasting concepts of brightness and darkness.",
  ["100103181_18"]="Its grandeur and loftiness had never been witnessed before and would not be witnessed ever again in the future.",
  ["100103181_19"]="All the most skillful works made by imperial craftsmen paled in comparison to one-millionth of it.",
  ["100103181_2"]="It was a time so long ago that the concept of \"history\" had not yet been born.",
  ["100103181_20"]="Where did it come from?",
  ["100103181_21"]="Who created it?",
  ["100103181_22"]="Why is it standing here?",
  ["100103181_23"]="The world remained silent in the face of the scholar's questions.",
  ["100103181_24"]="The monolith, like a riddle thrown down by the gods from the heavens, silently loomed over the scholar.",
  ["100103181_25"]="Despite his awe and reverence, the scholar, driven by his desire for the answer, touched the monolith.",
  ["100103181_26"]="Suddenly, the monolith emitted a flash of white light.",
  ["100103181_27"]="Heaven and earth, along with mountains, rivers, and roads, vanished from his sight, along with the monolith.",
  ["100103181_28"]="At that moment, he caught a glimpse of an indescribable circle of light.",
  ["100103181_29"]="It was an abstract shape that would have eluded any scholar's comprehension. He vaguely realized he had encountered a higher being, but the glimpse was fleeting, and everything disappeared once more.",
  ["100103181_3"]="In the fertile land between the two rivers, a civilization called Obed emerged.",
  ["100103181_30"]="In its place, a peculiar room materialized.",
  ["100103181_31"]="The room existed both within and beyond his understanding.",
  ["100103181_32"]="It was a square room constructed of mud bricks, unlike any other building material known to the scholar at that time.",
  ["100103181_33"]="For some reason, in the center of the room stood an empty shelf, a reed pen, and countless clay tablets.",
  ["100103181_34"]="Who built this room? And who left those tools here?",
  ["100103181_35"]="The scholar had no time to ponder.",
  ["100103181_36"]="The empty shelf must be filled, just as every question must have an answer.",
  ["100103181_37"]="The scholar's mind became consumed by this single thought, as if the gods behind the riddle were whispering in his ear.",
  ["100103181_38"]="Hence, the scholar embarked on the task of recording his life's insights on the clay tablet using the reed pen.",
  ["100103181_39"]="He wrote with unwavering duty.",
  ["100103181_4"]="Under the banner of the new civilization, a city named Eridu was established in the cradle of water.",
  ["100103181_40"]="Once he finished the first clay tablet, he placed it on the stone shelf.",
  ["100103181_41"]="However, the feeling of emptiness in the scholar's soul remained unresolved.",
  ["100103181_42"]="So, he raised his reed pen and continued writing on the second clay tablet.",
  ["100103181_43"]="The clay tablets were inexhaustible, and the reed pen never wore out.",
  ["100103181_44"]="The scholar wrote for an extensive period, oblivious to exhaustion, hunger, and the passage of time.",
  ["100103181_45"]="As the first shelf was filled with clay tablets, another shelf materialized out of thin air. This was followed by a third, fourth, fifth, and so forth...",
  ["100103181_46"]="After all the shelves, and even the room itself, were laden with clay tablets, the three walls vanished, revealing three passageways that led to three new rooms.",
  ["100103181_47"]="By offering one's knowledge, one would obtain the god's mercy and the privilege to use this realm.",
  ["100103181_48"]="Finally, the scholar comprehended that he had stumbled upon a miracle.",
  ["100103181_49"]="And so...",
  ["100103181_5"]="It was the first city and the first civilization in the Fertile Crescent.",
  ["100103181_50"]="Pointing to the land, the scholar declared:",
  ["100103181_51"]="Come, We will erect a tower",
  ["100103181_52"]="And so...",
  ["100103181_53"]="Its peak touches the sky, and knowledge stored within its walls.",
  ["100103181_54"]="Foundations were laid, pillars were erected, and walls were constructed.",
  ["100103181_55"]="Seeking finest resources of all corners. Materials, including brick, cedar, and stone, and professionals, including artisans, boatmen, and miners.",
  ["100103181_56"]="A miracle that grew through time and root within the earth.",
  ["100103181_57"]="Conquerors came and went, and empires rose and fell.",
  ["100103181_58"]="Dynasties rises, and the thrones do fall.",
  ["100103181_59"]="Only the tower stood witness, eternity to all.",
  ["100103181_6"]="Legend has it that the God of Water descended from the heavens and landed here, thus establishing Eridu.",
  ["100103181_60"]="And so...",
  ["100103181_61"]="The construction of this tower persisted.",
  ["100103181_62"]="Day after day.",
  ["100103181_63"]="Year after year.",
  ["100103181_64"]="Generation after generation.",
  ["100103181_65"]="And so...",
  ["100103181_66"]="The tower will eventually reach its completion.",
  ["100103181_67"]="And it will inevitably meet its downfall.",
  ["100103181_68"]="Such is the fate of this tower that reaches for the heavens.",
  ["100103181_69"]="Within the tower, a tale was passed down.",
  ["100103181_7"]="However, where did the god who bestowed kingship go after the city was founded?",
  ["100103181_70"]="It was a tale of the God of the Sun.",
  ["100103181_71"]="On the first day, when Ehtaton, the City of Eternal Night, lay enshrouded in darkness, it emerged as an answer to the fervent prayers of its devoted subjects. Its radiant light permeated the vast expanse of the world.",
  ["100103181_72"]="On the second day, it glimmered with a brilliance surpassing the eye of Leo, refusing to partake in the celestial dance of the other stars. Beneath its radiance, all living beings flourished.",
  ["100103181_73"]="On the third day, it unleashed its divine wrath, desiccating streams, withering grass, scorching roofs, and razing Ehtaton to the ground.",
  ["100103181_74"]="On the fourth day, news of its awe-inspiring power reached the King of All Kings, who retrieved it from the river and presented it within the Tower. The Immortal Army embarked on its ultimate expedition, driven by a thirst to unravel its secrets of immortality.",
  ["100103181_75"]="On the fifth day, it transformed into the Undying Star about the Philistine Sea. Witnessing its splendor, the three sages from the East hastened on a pilgrimage to Ephrathah to pay homage to it.",
  ["100103181_76"]="On the sixth day, it was retrieved and returned to the Tower by a maiden who understood her destiny. Within the cosmic tapestry that held the answers to all questions, the star concluded its final luminous journey.",
  ["100103181_77"]="On the seventh day, the eternal sun was extinguished, and the Tower crumbled, bearing witness to the god's eternal departure from the mortal realm.",
  ["100103181_78"]="From that moment onward, the universe stood bereft of deities and guiding laws.",
  ["100103181_79"]="Consequently, divine retribution ceased to manifest.",
  ["100103181_8"]="A scholar in the Empire was curious to find the answer.",
  ["100103181_9"]="In pursuit of the god, the scholar traveled up the river.",
  ["100103191_1"]="The Epilogue",
  ["100103191_10"]="No, if I remember correctly, the central database is actually located at...",
  ["100103191_11"]="The woman with dark green hair covers her forehead. After prolonged contemplation, she turns to her.",
  ["100103191_12"]="When did the tower in Obed collapse?",
  ["100103191_13"]="Are you talking about the legendary Tower of Babel? The Tower built thousands of years ago...? Wait! Did you say it collapsed? The Tower of Babel... collapsed?!",
  ["100103191_14"]="Qing lets out a sigh of relief.",
  ["100103191_15"]="Humanity's collective unconsciousness almost had us believing a different story about it.",
  ["100103191_16"]="Something must have happened to Eme-an and the Library of Babel.",
  ["100103191_17"]="Florentine Mansion, Bellefontaine",
  ["100103191_18"]="The melodious sound of the lyre dances beneath the young duchess's nimble fingers, floating above the open courtyard.",
  ["100103191_19"]="This melody could have soared freely like a bird in the vast sky, but an ominous cloud in the distance hangs over everyone, causing it to fold its wings and linger amidst the purple iris bushes.",
  ["100103191_2"]="There are two Grandeur Rivers in the world. One originates from the Immense Mountain, rushing thousands of miles eastward into the sea, nourishing the entire Fertile Plains. The other flows silently in the depths of history, unseen by the world, yet its basin is even more vast.",
  ["100103191_20"]="Finally, a raindrop lands in the heart of a blossom, releasing a faint fragrance that mingles with the piano's resonance.",
  ["100103191_21"]="Before more raindrops arrive, an umbrella opens, shielding the young duchess.",
  ["100103191_22"]="Your Grace, the election for the new Holy Cardinal is about to begin. The Holy Court has extended an invitation, and the other Cardinals have already departed for Javriel...",
  ["100103191_23"]="Noticing her master's indifference, the young steward's tone grows urgent.",
  ["100103191_24"]="I understand that leaving Bellefontaine at this moment would be a bold request. However...",
  ["100103191_25"]="However... if we remain here, we can only witness the villainous Sistine ascending to the throne...",
  ["100103191_26"]="The melody abruptly ceases.",
  ["100103191_27"]="Florence raises her hand, although she does not direct her gaze towards her loyal steward.",
  ["100103191_28"]="We will depart, Asti.",
  ["100103191_29"]="Have you finally made your decision, Your Grace?",
  ["100103191_3"]="WeiShi, CangLin City",
  ["100103191_30"]="Joy briefly flickers across Asti's face, but then she realizes that her master is not looking towards Javriel, the Eternal City, but rather...",
  ["100103191_31"]="It is time to fulfill our oath.",
  ["100103191_32"]="Florence mutters, staring at the dark clouds approaching from the east.",
  ["100103191_33"]="Unknown Time, Unknown Sector",
  ["100103191_34"]="By the way, aren't you worried about what will happen to the Library after Aten's explosion?",
  ["100103191_35"]="What a silly question. Can a star exploding really mess up the whole universe?",
  ["100103191_36"]="You know what I mean, right?",
  ["100103191_37"]="Yeah, I get it, but honestly, it doesn't really matter.",
  ["100103191_38"]="The only thing it messes up is the original module of their time sector. So basically, it'll only block their entrance.",
  ["100103191_39"]="The only thing that might affect our time sector is the ripples from the aftermath, but once those ripples settle down, everything will go back to normal.",
  ["100103191_4"]="The agricultural production in CangLin City is going smoothly today.",
  ["100103191_40"]="Plus, even if their entrance is gone, they can just make a new one. As long as the Beacon is still there, they make as many entrances as they need to.",
  ["100103191_41"]="Why did you say all that stuff to them earlier?",
  ["100103191_42"]="Ah, I was just messing with them. Oh, you mean the last sentence, huh?",
  ["100103191_43"]="May we meet again in the future.",
  ["100103191_44"]="It meant what it meant. I had a feeling that we'd run into [BBNAME] again in the future.",
  ["100103191_45"]="Perhaps in the future... No, perhaps we've already met in some time sector. Well, who knows?",
  ["100103191_46"]="Anyway, stop distracting me with such useless stuff! I've got to update the new routes of the Library on my map!",
  ["100103191_47"]="Ruined Tower of Babel",
  ["100103191_48"]="Dust swirls as day turns into night, blurring the line between sky and earth.",
  ["100103191_49"]="Several figures emerge from the haze.",
  ["100103191_5"]="Send the report regarding the anomalies in the Grandeur River to Fengbei so Yuanquan can review it.",
  ["100103191_50"]="The leader steps on the remains of what was once a tower, now reduced to broken walls. The fragile bricks crumble at the slightest touch, turning into scattered dust in the air.",
  ["100103191_51"]="The more magnificent something is, the more tragic it will be after it collapses.",
  ["100103191_52"]="*cough* *cough*",
  ["100103191_53"]="The person covers her mouth and nose.",
  ["100103191_54"]="Curse that Polestarer! How dare he give me such a stupid task?!",
  ["100103191_55"]="And don't even get me started on the God of the Sun! There isn't even a single intact brick here. Am I supposed to recycle air or something?",
  ["100103191_56"]="...!",
  ["100103191_57"]="Her words come to an abrupt halt.",
  ["100103191_58"]="A harsh wind cuts through the swirling sand, as if thunder is splitting the dark clouds. Everything becomes clear once again.",
  ["100103191_59"]="Gradually, the figure of a tall woman becomes visible.",
  ["100103191_6"]="And send a copy to the central database of C.A.V.E., too.",
  ["100103191_60"]="Well, look who we have here? Filthy rats from Nemesis.",
  ["100103191_61"]="The woman closes her fan, making a sharp sound that catches everyone's attention.",
  ["100103191_62"]="Still standing your ground, huh? So, you want to face me head-on? Well, I don't have all day. Let your mercenaries come at me together.",
  ["100103191_63"]="Tsk.",
  ["100103191_64"]="The figure raises her hand, and all the mercenaries step back until they are completely concealed within the sand.",
  ["100103191_65"]="The black-haired woman puts away her fan and looks in the direction the invaders retreated. Instead of giving chase, she lowers her gaze to the two unconscious Eme-ans at her feet.",
  ["100103191_66"]="I was on a business trip when Viola called me, so I thought I'd drop by, but I didn't expect to clean up such a mess.",
  ["100103191_67"]="Now this is just miserable... Huh? Only two of them managed to escape? How strange... And who's this?",
  ["100103191_68"]="Zhantan furrows her brow as she sees the stranger being shielded by the young lady.",
  ["100103191_69"]="Thanks to Zero's protection, the outlander does not seem to have any serious injuries, except for a bit of blood on the forehead.",
  ["100103191_7"]="The report has been sent to Fengbei. Can you remind me where we're supposed to send the copy?",
  ["100103191_70"]="Hmm...",
  ["100103191_71"]="I'll just take them back to Qian.",
  ["100103191_8"]="Didn't I just say it? It goes to the central database of C.A.V.E... huh?",
  ["100103191_9"]="But isn't the database right here?",
  ["1001040101_1"]="The turquoise water, mountains' green embrace. Pines and snow, a mesmerizing grace.",
  ["1001040101_10"]="Don't fret. No one from my clan would dare defy me.",
  ["1001040101_11"]="Speaking of which, why would a mere historian have the authority to tell you what to do?",
  ["1001040101_12"]="A historian? Did I forget something again?",
  ["1001040101_13"]="Hmph, you'll have to figure it out on your own.",
  ["1001040101_14"]="I met a historian on my way here, and he implored me to urge you to think of a name.",
  ["1001040101_15"]="Oh... Looks like I've forgotten everything about it. What is the name about?",
  ["1001040101_16"]="He said it was some kind of \"national title.\" Your language can be quite troublesome.",
  ["1001040101_17"]="Ah, I remember now. It was indeed an oversight on my part.",
  ["1001040101_18"]="I'm surprised when he told me he simply couldn't start recording anything without that name. What exactly is that name about?",
  ["1001040101_19"]="It's about everything.",
  ["1001040101_2"]="Lotus blooms, adorned with elegance and light. A scene of beauty, nature's exquisite delight.",
  ["1001040101_20"]="It's about you, me, your clan, my clan, the greater clan formed by our future generations, and the heavens, the earth, the mountains, the rivers—everything that traverses the seasons and is witnessed by the sun and the moon.",
  ["1001040101_21"]="In short, it's a name that encompasses everything we're seeing now.",
  ["1001040101_22"]="Wow, that's quite a serious name. So, have you come up with it yet?",
  ["1001040101_23"]="Yes... it shall be \"Xia\", meaning \"summer\".",
  ["1001040101_24"]="May this vast land forever flourish in greenery.",
  ["1001040101_25"]="The Eternal Fruitless Summer",
  ["1001040101_26"]="July 15, Year 57 of the World Calendar",
  ["1001040101_27"]="CangLin City, Jiangyin Region, Qian",
  ["1001040101_28"]="CangLin City, meaning \"the granary,\" serves as the largest agricultural production base in Qian.",
  ["1001040101_29"]="The air is teeming with dragonflies and butterflies fluttering among the blooming flowers during the extended summer.",
  ["1001040101_3"]="How weird. Despite being closer to the sun, why is it colder here?",
  ["1001040101_30"]="The Grandeur River stretches for thousands of miles, nourishing all living things in the Jiangyin Region.",
  ["1001040101_31"]="<color=#fec66b>Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture</color>, this is <color=#fec66b>Qing</color> from the <color=#fec66b>Bureau of Oversight & Integrity</color>. I'm currently conducting my daily inspections at Hydrological Observatory A38 in the main of the Grandeur River.",
  ["1001040101_32"]="I'll be sending the hydrological and meteorological data. Please analyze the data and deliver the report to the municipal government.",
  ["1001040101_33"]="Understood. Please provide an adequate number of samples for analysis and comparison.",
  ["1001040101_34"]="Sure, I'll personally oversee the operation.",
  ["1001040101_35"]="Seeing Qing end the communication, the operator beside her strikes up a friendly chat.",
  ["1001040101_36"]="I heard that once this quarter's inspections are completed, you'll be taking a whole month off, Secretary Qing?",
  ["1001040101_37"]="Usually, Qing would not entertain casual chitchat at work, but since her tasks are almost complete, she answers in an unusually gentle tone.",
  ["1001040101_38"]="Yeah, the work here is finally about to end, so I plan to take some time off and enjoy the <color=#fec66b>Harvest Festival</color> in September as a civilian.",
  ["1001040101_39"]="Thank you for your hard word. By the way, here's a little gift for you.",
  ["1001040101_4"]="Because the Tianchi Lake is surrounded by snowy mountains.",
  ["1001040101_40"]="What's this?",
  ["1001040101_41"]="I snatched this yellow iris by the riverside. It's been blooming for more than a week without showing any signs of wilting, and its fragrance is intense. Hopefully, it will chase away some of your fatigue.",
  ["1001040101_42"]="Qing gently smells the fragrance of the petals, revealing a rare smile.",
  ["1001040101_43"]="However, as she examines the flower in her hand, her smile gradually fades.",
  ["1001040101_44"]="Did you just say you picked this flower by the river?",
  ["1001040101_45"]="Yeah, why? What's up?",
  ["1001040101_46"]="Qing looks toward the river outside the observatory.",
  ["1001040101_47"]="A flock of cormorants is perched on the riverside, packed tightly together and converging into a small cluster on the bank.",
  ["1001040101_48"]="The surface of the river is glowing with a bit of greenish color. Upon closer inspection, it is actually a huge number of water striders clustered together, their wings reflecting a metallic sheen.",
  ["1001040101_49"]="There are too many water striders out there...",
  ["1001040101_5"]="In front of two figures, the vast expanse of water reflects the distant snowy peaks, along with nearby buildings.",
  ["1001040101_50"]="Is something wrong?",
  ["1001040101_51"]="The operator asks, puzzled by Qing's silence.",
  ["1001040101_52"]="Qing takes another look at the flower in her hand and adjusts her glasses.",
  ["1001040101_53"]="In the center of the yellowish stamen, there is a slight lime-green sheen that cannot be perceived by ordinary people.",
  ["1001040101_54"]="I'll have to go to the riverside and see what's happening there.",
  ["1001040101_6"]="The days here appear as lengthy as those beneath Mount Tianque.",
  ["1001040101_7"]="Otherwise, one might mistake the prolonged summer in this place for a harsh winter.",
  ["1001040101_8"]="If it were indeed winter, the Tianchi Lake would be frozen, the Grandeur River obstructed, and the Hanze covered in ice. In that case, ascending Mount Tianque would be impossible.",
  ["1001040101_9"]="Shhh, keep your voice down. If your fellow clanspeople hear this, they might goad you into challenging me again during winter.",
  ["1001040102_1"]="I must hurry back to WeiShi and report the unusual situation here.",
  ["1001040102_2"]="<color=#fec66b>The subtle changes in the flower's appearance, the unusual clustering behavior, and those mutant insects and ospreys... </color> That's not my imagination.",
  ["1001040102_3"]="No doubt this is caused by an <color=#fec66b>anomaly</color>.",
  ["1001040102_4"]="She takes off her glasses and wrinkles her nose.",
  ["1001040102_5"]="Again, my precious vacation is going down the drain. Instead, I'm looking at overtime.",
  ["1001040201_1"]="Title",
  ["1001040201_10"]="Feng Lin, the young director of the bureau, holds up his glasses.",
  ["1001040201_11"]="To be frank... it's getting worse.",
  ["1001040201_12"]="According to our calculations, all types of crops should have started to mature long ago.",
  ["1001040201_13"]="However, the centralized agricultural system detects that wheat, sorghum, rice, and other ration crops remain stagnant in their growth phase without any signs of sprouting ears.",
  ["1001040201_14"]="Oilseed crops such as soybeans, peanuts, and flax haven't yet produced seeds for oil extraction.",
  ["1001040201_15"]="Fruit trees such as apples, pears, and peaches experienced successful pollination during the flowering period, but they haven't progressed beyond the end of that phase.",
  ["1001040201_16"]="All crops have stopped developing fruits, as if the growth process has come to a standstill.",
  ["1001040201_17"]="In addition, the drones managed by the centralized agricultural system have observed new symptoms on the crops.",
  ["1001040201_18"]="What symptoms?",
  ["1001040201_19"]="I've brought some photos here. Please take a look at them.",
  ["1001040201_2"]="Emergency Meeting",
  ["1001040201_20"]="As you can see, many crops are exhibiting an unusual greenish color on their surface.",
  ["1001040201_21"]="This color is not attributable to natural chlorophyll, but resembles a metallic rather than a biological coloration.",
  ["1001040201_22"]="On affected plants, this greenish tint behaves akin to a rust disease, spreading towards the unaffected parts of the plant.",
  ["1001040201_23"]="Could this be a new plant pathogen?",
  ["1001040201_24"]="That was our initial suspicion. However, it's not only the crops, but also some animals residing in the fields that are displaying these symptoms.",
  ["1001040201_25"]="While we have dealt with zoonotic diseases before, this is the first time we have encountered a plant-animal disease. The Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture currently lacks the means to identify cross-species diseases.",
  ["1001040201_26"]="So we collected samples and sent them to the Bureau of Health & Welfare for virus testing, but we haven't receive any results yet.",
  ["1001040201_27"]="Bureau of Health & Welfare, have you discovered anything yet?",
  ["1001040201_28"]="<color=#fec66b>The Bureau of Health & Welfare is in charge of medical and public health.</color> At this point, its director is suffering from a cold sweat.",
  ["1001040201_29"]="Well... just as Director Feng said, diseases affecting both plants and animals are exceptionally rare, and we need more time.",
  ["1001040201_3"]="One week later.",
  ["1001040201_30"]="So, no results yet.",
  ["1001040201_31"]="There will be results! We just need a little bit more time...",
  ["1001040201_32"]="No progress in virus testing. Thank you for the report.",
  ["1001040201_33"]="Next question. Bureau of Treasury & Trade, how much do you predict our agricultural production will drop this year?",
  ["1001040201_34"]="The director of the <color=#fec66b>Bureau of Treasury & Trade</color>, responsible for finance-related matters, is visibly perspiring.",
  ["1001040201_35"]="This issue is quite complicated, Secretary Qing. Since we are not directly involved in agricultural production, we are not aware of the details...",
  ["1001040201_36"]="Please stay on topic.",
  ["1001040201_37"]="Well... we can only give economic forecasts after the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture provides reports on crop maturity and acreage. However, they haven't provided such reports this year...",
  ["1001040201_38"]="Qing's tone begins to reflect a hint of annoyance.",
  ["1001040201_39"]="Now is not the time to pass the buck.",
  ["1001040201_4"]="CangLin municipal government, the center of CangLin City.",
  ["1001040201_40"]="I'm not blaming you. I need to understand the gravity of the situation facing CangLin City.",
  ["1001040201_41"]="I believe I have made myself clear. Please provide a concise answer.",
  ["1001040201_42"]="Based on the information shared by Director Feng, we will have to make estimations based on the worst-case scenario.",
  ["1001040201_43"]="This year, our agricultural production will be only 3% to 7% of prior years' levels.",
  ["1001040201_44"]="I understand.",
  ["1001040201_45"]="CangLin City plays a crucial role in Qian's agricultural production, and if we don't have a harvest, it will create a crisis for all of Qian.",
  ["1001040201_46"]="Director Feng, could you please provide an update on our grain reserves?",
  ["1001040201_47"]="Our current reserves are enough to feed the people of Qian for nine months. Together with the reserves in the rest of the country, we can sustain ourselves for two years without a harvest.",
  ["1001040201_48"]="<color=#fec66b>Bureau of Roads & Travel</color>, what's the status of our transportation capacity?",
  ["1001040201_49"]="Mobilization is not an overnight process. It involves multiple parties and numerous challenges.",
  ["1001040201_5"]="In light of the current situation, the chief Secretary has personally gone to <color=#fec66b>Jiangyin Pavilion</color> to report to his superiors. During his absence, the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity will be responsible for city management.",
  ["1001040201_50"]="What specific challenges are you talking about? Bring them up, and we'll work together to address them.",
  ["1001040201_51"]="First, there is a serious shortage of professional drivers.",
  ["1001040201_52"]="Then why don't you communicate with the <color=#fec66b>Bureau of Employment & Social Support</color>? Any other problems?",
  ["1001040201_53"]="We lack the funds to purchase enough vehicles for transportation.",
  ["1001040201_54"]="That falls under the responsibility of the Bureau of Treasury & Trade. Go ask for additional funds from them.",
  ["1001040201_55"]="But... the annual budget is set at the beginning of every year. Even if I make a request, it'll likely be rejected, right?",
  ["1001040201_56"]="So, in other words, you haven't even asked the Bureau of Treasury & Trade for additional funds.",
  ["1001040201_57"]="No, that's not the case. According to regulations, the budget is approved at the beginning of each year, and the allocation...",
  ["1001040201_58"]="Allow me to remind you, Director. I work in the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity, and I know the rules and regulations better than you do.",
  ["1001040201_59"]="Bureau of Treasury & Trade, has the Bureau of Roads & Travel ever informed you about the lack of funds?",
  ["1001040201_6"]="Therefore, I'll be presiding over this meeting, and I ask for your cooperation as always.",
  ["1001040201_60"]="No.",
  ["1001040201_61"]="No, never. Why didn't you mention it, Director?",
  ["1001040201_62"]="We... we will submit a formal application after the meeting.",
  ["1001040201_63"]="Are there any other difficulties?",
  ["1001040201_64"]="We haven't encountered such a large-scale demand for transportation capacity in many years. It requires coordination of water, air, road, and rail transportation, and we're still trying to figure out how to manage this.",
  ["1001040201_65"]="Don't you have an emergency plan in place?",
  ["1001040201_66"]="You know... this situation is too rare for us to have anticipated.",
  ["1001040201_67"]="You may not have an emergency plan for total crop failure, but you should have a plan for a potential war, right? Or you don't have a plan for that either?!",
  ["1001040201_68"]="But we've been living in peace for decades...",
  ["1001040201_69"]="During our last meeting, I emphasized that we must prepare for the worst.",
  ["1001040201_7"]="First of all, I'd like to ask for a briefing on the progress of our deployments since our last meeting.",
  ["1001040201_70"]="So, what exactly have you prepared for this meeting? Nothing at all?!",
  ["1001040201_71"]="Let me ask you some questions.",
  ["1001040201_72"]="How many trucks do we have? How many freight trains? And how many cargo planes and ships? What is the capacity of each transportation method?",
  ["1001040201_73"]="How many of these vehicles can be deployed within 24 hours? Within seven days? And within a month?",
  ["1001040201_74"]="How many of these vehicles are equipped with refrigeration and insulation devices for transporting grain? For the vehicles without these capabilities, how long would it take to install them?",
  ["1001040201_75"]="Do we have enough drivers for all these vehicles? Do we have a plan in place for scheduling and providing financial subsidies for the drivers?",
  ["1001040201_76"]="Well... we... uh... we have limited manpower and capabilities... I apologize for our shortcomings...",
  ["1001040201_77"]="My patience is wearing thin. The Bureau of Roads & Travel has shown laziness, cowardice, short-sightedness, and incompetence.",
  ["1001040201_78"]="Your laziness has delayed progress, your cowardice has hindered collaboration with other departments, your short-sightedness has prevented proper planning, and your incompetence gave you the audacity to deceive me.",
  ["1001040201_79"]="Do you think you can just get away with \"we have limited manpower and capabilities\"? Your excuse holds no weight. The Bureau of Oversight & Integrity will submit an official report to the government, demanding accountability from the Bureau of Roads & Travel for impeding grain transportation.",
  ["1001040201_8"]="<color=#fec66b>Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture</color>, what's the current status of the crops?",
  ["1001040201_80"]="Bureau of Health & Welfare, your progress has been disappointingly slow. And Bureau of Treasury & Trade, you've failed to fulfill your duties. Consider this a warning.",
  ["1001040201_81"]="Director Feng, please say something to calm Secretary Qing down. We're being scolded all because of you...",
  ["1001040201_82"]="Feng Lin lowers his head and addresses Qing.",
  ["1001040201_83"]="Secretary Qing, our department bears the primary responsibility. We are to blame for the production issues.",
  ["1001040201_84"]="After all, other departments are assisting us in addressing the issue, and the purpose of this meeting is to find a solution as soon as possible.",
  ["1001040201_85"]="Let's all take a moment to calm down, for what they said holds truth. This dire situation is unprecedented and requires cooperation across departments and regions. We may even need to take guidance from the Wellbeing Office in the future.",
  ["1001040201_86"]="Do you have any suggestions for the current situation?",
  ["1001040201_87"]="Indeed, now is not the time to blame anyone.",
  ["1001040201_88"]="I apologize. I got a bit carried away.",
  ["1001040201_89"]="Everything has a cause, and there are no such things as \"mysterious catastrophes.\" Therefore, I request all departments to assist in investigating the causes behind the unproductive crops.",
  ["1001040201_9"]="The <color=#fec66b>Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture</color>, as its name implies, is the department in charge of agricultural production.",
  ["1001040201_90"]="I need reports on meteorological and hydrological monitoring, analysis of soil and bedrock composition, data on the density and size of various ecological populations, as well as information on crop growth and the results of genetic sequencing. The cause must be somewhere within this data.",
  ["1001040201_91"]="Meanwhile, we must be prepared to deliver reserve grain to the other regions and be ready to take immediate action upon receiving orders from the Wellbeing Office.",
  ["1001040201_92"]="Director Feng, based on the minimum requirement to ensure rations, how much reserve grain will we need to deliver once our total crop failure is confirmed?",
  ["1001040201_93"]="I can't provide an exact figure at the moment, but based on my experience, a minimum of forty million tons for the fall and winter seasons will be required.",
  ["1001040201_94"]="Then let's use that number. Forty million tons will be the minimum required.",
  ["1001040201_95"]="Remember, numbers do not negotiate or compromise. So, I hope everyone will do their best. No, I expect everyone to do their best.",
  ["1001040302_1"]="Those animals are gathering near these sprinklers.",
  ["1001040302_2"]="They seem to be attracted to the water from these sprinklers.",
  ["1001040302_3"]="Moreover, they appeared more aggressive after drinking the water.",
  ["1001040302_4"]="I must report this discovery to my peers immediately.",
  ["1001040401_1"]="Undercurrents",
  ["1001040401_10"]="Since Master Yuanquan went there personally, the situation must be dire.",
  ["1001040401_11"]="I don't have access to the details, but judging from the members Master Yuanquan took with him, the situation is indeed worrisome.",
  ["1001040401_12"]="I heard that QingYu City is currently isolated from the outside world.",
  ["1001040401_13"]="Such a renowned city was suddenly isolated from the rest of the world. Our public media has been carefully blocking the information to prevent suspicion and panic among the common people.",
  ["1001040401_14"]="Not to mention that Master Yuanquan has taken a great number of our elite members...",
  ["1001040401_15"]="How many people do we have here?",
  ["1001040401_16"]="Basically the ones you're seeing now.",
  ["1001040401_17"]="Before Master Yuanquan left, he left the matter of CangLin City in your hands.",
  ["1001040401_18"]="We're at your disposal now.",
  ["1001040401_19"]="I see. Thank you all for placing your trust in me.",
  ["1001040401_2"]="Hey guys, I'm back.",
  ["1001040401_20"]="I'll share the information with everyone here.",
  ["1001040401_21"]="Firstly, our judgment was correct. The total crop failure is indeed caused by the anomaly.",
  ["1001040401_22"]="Secondly, we need further investigation to figure out the symptoms of the plants and animals. The government has entrusted the Bureau of Health & Welfare with the task, but honestly, they're hardly reliable.",
  ["1001040401_23"]="Here is the image and pathology data I got from the bureau.",
  ["1001040401_24"]="I'll do the imaging analysis.",
  ["1001040401_25"]="I will conduct the pathology analysis.",
  ["1001040401_26"]="The Bureau of Treasury & Trade will face significant financial challenges this year. We should be prepared for drastic market fluctuations.",
  ["1001040401_27"]="I've been monitoring the market and economic indicators.",
  ["1001040401_28"]="If you spot anything unusual, report to me immediately.",
  ["1001040401_29"]="Next, the Bureau of Roads & Travel has been slow on progress, and I've already reprimanded them. However, it'll take some time for them to actually do something.",
  ["1001040401_3"]="Hey, Qing, finished the meeting at the government?",
  ["1001040401_30"]="We can mobilize transportation capacities from other regions through our channels.",
  ["1001040401_31"]="Let's hold off on that for now. It's a task that falls within the capabilities of the CangLin municipal government, and we mustn't encourage their laziness or interfere too much with everyday society.",
  ["1001040401_32"]="However, we should still make preparations, and if the Bureau of Roads & Travel fails to fulfill their responsibilities, we will need to take action.",
  ["1001040401_33"]="Lastly, the symptoms indicate the possibility of a cross-species disease.",
  ["1001040401_34"]="If humans can also be infected, the situation will be much more severe than just a food shortage.",
  ["1001040401_35"]="I'm monitoring all major hospitals. If I come across any patients with similar symptoms, I will report to you immediately.",
  ["1001040401_36"]="Monitoring hospitals alone won't be enough. Once patients start arriving at hospitals, it means the infection has already spread. We need an emergency plan for a potential pandemic.",
  ["1001040401_37"]="At what scale should we prepare?",
  ["1001040401_38"]="The worst-case scenario: assume that all of CangLin City is affected.",
  ["1001040401_39"]="By the way, have we received any communication from the Eme-an with whom we lost contact two days ago? The information in their central database might help us trace the origin of this anomaly.",
  ["1001040401_4"]="Yeah, all directors had a brief discussion and mapped out the current situation.",
  ["1001040401_40"]="No, we haven't received any response from them. Their communication channel has been silent for three days. This is unprecedented.",
  ["1001040401_41"]="We have estimated the worst-case scenario: the Tower of Babel has been destroyed due to an event beyond Eme-an's capabilities, and the central database won't be able to provide any support during this crisis.",
  ["1001040401_42"]="Before we lost contact, Zhantan received a message from them and went to Obed to investigate. We should expect to hear from her in the next few days.",
  ["1001040401_43"]="When it rains, it pours...",
  ["1001040401_44"]="By the way, has Xin come back? It's been a while since I sent her out. I believe she has completed her task.",
  ["1001040401_5"]="Qing glances at the main seat in the hall.",
  ["1001040401_6"]="Is Master Yuanquan here?",
  ["1001040401_7"]="No, unfortunately, Master Yuanquan left.",
  ["1001040401_8"]="Did he go to <color=#fec66b>QingYu City</color>?",
  ["1001040401_9"]="Yes, our early intelligence indicated that the anomaly originated there. As for why the anomaly spread to CangLin City, we don't have any clues yet.",
  ["1001040501_1"]="Thousands of Miles of Fertile Farmland",
  ["1001040501_10"]="Now I'm really ticked off! She made me follow those ridiculous rules, and now I'm running errands for her!",
  ["1001040501_11"]="Just you wait, Qing. When I get back, I'll definitely demand a hearty meal!",
  ["1001040501_12"]="The girl's teeth scrape off the last bits of pulp. As she instinctively prepares to spit out the seeds, she hesitates for a moment.",
  ["1001040501_13"]="(Qing said not to litter.)",
  ["1001040501_14"]="(But then again, my biology teacher said that the seeds and core can naturally decompose in nature.)",
  ["1001040501_15"]="(So, if I just toss the core, is it littering or fertilizing the field?)",
  ["1001040501_16"]="(Whose advice should I follow now?)",
  ["1001040501_17"]="(Ah, forget it, there's no surveillance here. No one's watching anyway...)",
  ["1001040501_18"]="She makes up her mind, her tongue pressed against a seed, ready to flick it away.",
  ["1001040501_19"]="Right at that moment, a lizard darts out of the grass, brushes past her feet, and causes her to stumble.",
  ["1001040501_2"]="The Fertile Plains, a vast stretch of land nourished by the Grandeur River, has prospered since ancient times. It is renowned for its abundant resources.",
  ["1001040501_20"]="The seed, half in and half out of her mouth, slips down her throat.",
  ["1001040501_21"]="Um...? Ummm... *cough* *cough*",
  ["1001040501_22"]="She pounds her chest for several seconds, gasping for breath, before finally swallowing the seed caught in her throat.",
  ["1001040501_23"]="Nervously, she wipes the saliva from the corners of her mouth.",
  ["1001040501_24"]="You stupid lizard!",
  ["1001040501_25"]="Xin vents her frustration in the direction the lizard disappeared, but what she sees in front of her silences her complaints.",
  ["1001040501_26"]="Despite it being late July, with autumn just around the corner, there is no hint of golden hues in the fields.",
  ["1001040501_27"]="The lush, vibrant green somehow pricks her heart.",
  ["1001040501_28"]="Now this is a serious problem. If we can't resolve it before autumn arrives, Qian will face a severe crop failure.",
  ["1001040501_29"]="In that case, the food supply of Qian will be in trouble. Even if we manage to survive this year with our reserves, what will we rely on next year?",
  ["1001040501_3"]="Currently, all fields in the Fertile Plains, encircling CangLin City, are managed under the city's centralized agricultural production system. Its agricultural output alone is sufficient to sustain a significant portion of the Qian population.",
  ["1001040501_30"]="We must not allow a recurrence of the devastating famine that struck the Western Region fifteen years ago. Everyone here, please uncover the truth and lift the crisis before the end of summer.",
  ["1001040501_31"]="Xin purses her lips.",
  ["1001040501_32"]="Alright, enough talking. It's time to get to work...",
  ["1001040501_4"]="During the peak of summer, the grass grows vigorously, and as a gentle breeze sweeps through, waves of seedlings and leaves wash across the fields.",
  ["1001040501_5"]="In the farmer-traversed fields, a girl dressed in attire that appears out of place amidst her surroundings steps onto the land.",
  ["1001040501_6"]="They told me to find out where the mutation came from, but they didn't give me any details.",
  ["1001040501_7"]="Am I supposed to search every nook and cranny of this place?",
  ["1001040501_8"]="The girl grumbles as she munches on the pear, casually strolling along the road.",
  ["1001040501_9"]="Even though she is clearly eating an apple, she tears into each bite as if she is devouring meat, quickly leaving only the core.",
  ["1001040502_1"]="Xin knocks out the last ox and shakes her hands.",
  ["1001040502_10"]="The old man scrutinizes Xin for a moment.",
  ["1001040502_11"]="Oh? So, the government sent you here? And you took down all these oxen by yourself?",
  ["1001040502_12"]="Xin hesitates for a moment. Actually, she was sent here by WeiShi, but regular people don't even know about its existence. For her, it is probably best to go along with the old man's words and see where it leads.",
  ["1001040502_13"]="Yeah, you could say that. By the way, just so you know, your oxen attacked me first, and I knocked them out. I didn't kill them or anything!",
  ["1001040502_14"]="The old man sighs as he examines the unconscious oxen.",
  ["1001040502_15"]="I know. Something's been off with them lately. Look at their skin, all turned green. Must be some kind of disease. It's really bad, you know...",
  ["1001040502_16"]="(So, he can't see the greenish crystals on those oxen? He seems like an ordinary person.)",
  ["1001040502_17"]="Things haven't been too peaceful around here lately, so an old man like you should just stay home.",
  ["1001040502_18"]="I'd love to, but I'm in charge of this field. How am I supposed to just stay home?",
  ["1001040502_19"]="Then he changes the topic.",
  ["1001040502_2"]="These oxen are totally mutated. Were they really meant for plowing the land?",
  ["1001040502_20"]="You've done a great job, to be honest. Dealing with all those beasts by yourself must be exhausting, right? Why don't you come to my place and have lunch?",
  ["1001040502_21"]="Xin's eyes light up.",
  ["1001040502_22"]="Oh? You've prepared lunch? Then let's go!",
  ["1001040502_23"]="Soon, hot food is placed on the table.",
  ["1001040502_24"]="Come, give it a try. It might not be fancy, but all the ingredients were grown here, fresh and good for you.",
  ["1001040502_25"]="Mmhm! It's so tasty!",
  ["1001040502_26"]="Xin eagerly grabs a rice bowl and digs in.",
  ["1001040502_27"]="The old man gives her a warm smile.",
  ["1001040502_28"]="Take your time, and don't gobble it all up like that, little girl. I may not be wealthy, but you can eat as much as you want.",
  ["1001040502_29"]="I can tell you're not from Jiangyin Region. Where's your hometown?",
  ["1001040502_3"]="Anyway, their horns and hooves look like metal crystals, and their bodies have undergone significant changes.",
  ["1001040502_30"]="Xin swallows the grilled chicken before replying to the old man's question.",
  ["1001040502_31"]="I was born in the Western Region. How did you figure that out, old man?",
  ["1001040502_32"]="After saying that, she stuffs another spoonful of rice into her mouth.",
  ["1001040502_33"]="As I thought... you're indeed from the Western Region.",
  ["1001040502_34"]="The old man's gaze turns gloomy.",
  ["1001040502_35"]="It's been many years since there was a famine in Jiangyin Region, but in the Western Region... I saw many kids starving fifteen years ago.",
  ["1001040502_36"]="People who have experienced famine and those who haven't... they eat differently.",
  ["1001040502_37"]="Starvation leaves a memory that seeps into your very bones. Even when you have enough food in later days, starvation sticks with you for the rest of your life and adds its flavor to every grain of rice you chew in every meal thereafter.",
  ["1001040502_38"]="...",
  ["1001040502_39"]="Oh, I'm sorry. Did that bring back bad memories? Judging by your age, you must have been born during that great famine.",
  ["1001040502_4"]="They only seem to gather around when the sprinklers are on, as if they're drawn to the water itself...",
  ["1001040502_40"]="Xin keeps her head down, her expression hidden behind the large bowl.",
  ["1001040502_41"]="Yes.",
  ["1001040502_42"]="After gobbling down the last mouthful of rice, Xin finally raises her head again and responds to the old man with seriousness.",
  ["1001040502_43"]="You don't need to be sorry, old man. It wasn't your fault.",
  ["1001040502_44"]="The old man shakes his head.",
  ["1001040502_45"]="I know... but once you've seen a disaster like that, you'll never forget it.",
  ["1001040502_46"]="I just hope that no one will ever go hungry again in the land of Qian.",
  ["1001040502_47"]="However, the crops are growing noticeably slower this year, and I'm worried that if this continues, it'll affect the harvest in the fall. We might not even be able to hold the Harvest Festival.",
  ["1001040502_48"]="Since you've been living here, old man, have you noticed anything unusual?",
  ["1001040502_49"]="Well, everything is so messed up around here. You might as well ask me what's still normal.",
  ["1001040502_5"]="Xin's thoughts are interrupted by a voice.",
  ["1001040502_50"]="But if I were to investigate, I'd start with the Grandeur River. Usually, when crops and animals get sick on a large scale, the first thing to suspect is the water source.",
  ["1001040502_51"]="After all, the entire sprinkler system in CangLin City uses water from the Grandeur River.",
  ["1001040502_52"]="The Grandeur River?",
  ["1001040502_53"]="Where are my notes? Oh, here they are! Let's see...",
  ["1001040502_54"]="Take your time. I'll go get you some fruit.",
  ["1001040502_55"]="Sure enough, the closer the animals are to the water source, the more intense their mutations become...",
  ["1001040502_56"]="I'm full now, old man! Thanks for treating me! Oh, and don't forget what I said! Just stay home!",
  ["1001040502_57"]="Xin gets up, gathers her belongings, and hurries out the door.",
  ["1001040502_58"]="She is so focused that she fails to notice another person standing right outside.",
  ["1001040502_59"]="With quick reflexes, she twists her body just in time to avoid colliding with the person.",
  ["1001040502_6"]="Hey, who's causing all that ruckus outside?",
  ["1001040502_60"]="The person walks past her without any interaction.",
  ["1001040502_61"]="As their shoulders touch, Xin's back tenses.",
  ["1001040502_62"]="Her instinctual alertness, reminiscent of an animal, sends a shiver down her spine, awakening her long-lost sense of vigilance. Unable to resist, she steals a glance at the person who passed by.",
  ["1001040502_63"]="It is a tall, gray-haired man dressed in a plain farming uniform, exhibiting an honest and sincere expression.",
  ["1001040502_64"]="He appears to be an ordinary farmer.",
  ["1001040502_65"]="Coming to this realization, Xin looks away, relaxes her shoulders, and resumes walking at her normal pace.",
  ["1001040502_66"]="(Huh? Who's this guy? The old man's son? Or his grandson?)",
  ["1001040502_67"]="(Eh, whatever. Not important. I gotta get back and fill in Qing.)",
  ["1001040502_7"]="An old man steps out of the house. His tone softens when he sees Xin.",
  ["1001040502_8"]="What are you doing in a place like this, little girl?",
  ["1001040502_9"]="I'm here to check out this field.",
  ["1001040601_1"]="The Impending Storm",
  ["1001040601_10"]="Qing holds back a smile at the corner of his mouth.",
  ["1001040601_11"]="Alright, go ahead and spill the beans.",
  ["1001040601_12"]="Xin opens her mouth, intending to report what she has discovered.",
  ["1001040601_13"]="But somehow, the only thing that comes to her mind is the meal she ended up having with the farmland administrator.",
  ["1001040601_14"]="The rest seems to have slipped her mind as she rushed back.",
  ["1001040601_15"]="She scratches her head, desperately trying to recall the words she heard after the meal.",
  ["1001040601_16"]="So... I bumped into this old farmer who told me that when crops and animals get sick on a large scale, the first thing to suspect is the water source. So, I'm thinking the issue's with the water!",
  ["1001040601_17"]="It is as if those words have unleashed a flood of memories.",
  ["1001040601_18"]="Oh yeah! The water source! The closer the animals to it, the worse their mutations get.",
  ["1001040601_19"]="Here are samples of the plants and insects I collected from the river. Look, they're practically bronze now.",
  ["1001040601_2"]="When it rains, it pours...",
  ["1001040601_20"]="And let's not forget those livestock. They're obsessed with drinking water... like they're totally addicted.",
  ["1001040601_21"]="The first thing to suspect is the water source. A reasonable guess, don't you think?",
  ["1001040601_22"]="At that moment, other investigators are returning to the hall as well.",
  ["1001040601_23"]="I've collected soil samples, and I discovered a linear correlation between soil water saturation and the degree of plant mutation.",
  ["1001040601_24"]="I've collected groundwater samples, and they contain an unidentified impurity. The concentration of this impurity is negatively correlated with the distance from the river at the sampling sites.",
  ["1001040601_25"]="And I've sampled the mutant plant and animal cells. Through isotopic tracing, I found a nonlinear positive correlation between the impurity in the water and the degree of cellular mutation.",
  ["1001040601_26"]="Hey, can you talk like a person? Say something I can understand!",
  ["1001040601_27"]="Thank you, everyone.",
  ["1001040601_28"]="So, the problem does lie in the water source, which confirms our initial suspicions. After all, the most direct connection between QingYu City and CangLin City is the Grandeur River.",
  ["1001040601_29"]="In other words, the anomaly affecting QingYu City has spread to CangLin City downstream through the water of the Grandeur River.",
  ["1001040601_3"]="By the way, has Xin come back? It's been a while since I sent her out. I believe she has completed her task.",
  ["1001040601_30"]="Tsk, fancy words aside, they reached the same conclusion as me.",
  ["1001040601_31"]="This is how it goes, Xin. Even if it seems obvious, we can't jump to conclusions without solid evidence. Learn from it, alright?",
  ["1001040601_32"]="You don't understand a word because you haven't learned statistics or chemistry. I'll find time to give you a crash course.",
  ["1001040601_33"]="Oh no, more studying? I'd rather stick to running errands for you.",
  ["1001040601_34"]="Don't sweat it. We'll consider that once we resolve everything. We don't have time for that with the dire situation right now.",
  ["1001040601_35"]="Upon hearing her words, Xin lets out a sigh of relief.",
  ["1001040601_36"]="First and foremost, we must ensure that the people of CangLin City stop drinking water from the Grandeur River.",
  ["1001040601_37"]="This matter directly affects people's daily lives and requires the intervention of the CangLin municipal government. I'll handle this part.",
  ["1001040601_38"]="As for the unidentified impurity in the water, it's deeply concerning.",
  ["1001040601_39"]="Since we're unable to identify it... Oh, by the way, has our friend from Delphi left already?",
  ["1001040601_4"]="At that very moment, a fiery figure darts into the hall.",
  ["1001040601_40"]="You mean Logos, right? Not yet. She's interested in our ancient books and has been spending the past few days reading in the storage room.",
  ["1001040601_41"]="Alright, prepare three water samples and request her immediate return to Delphi. The medical academy in Delphi should be able to figure out the composition of the impurity.",
  ["1001040601_42"]="Yes, I'll let her know right away",
  ["1001040601_43"]="Given the current situation, we're supposed to contact Eme-an, the head of C.A.V.E., as they're obligated to be informed about the situation here...",
  ["1001040601_44"]="But unfortunately, our communication channel has been silent for three days. I'm afraid we can't rely on the Library of Babel this time.",
  ["1001040601_45"]="Ah, hold up a sec, Qing. There's something else.",
  ["1001040601_46"]="What's wrong?",
  ["1001040601_47"]="Before Master Yuanquan left, he gave us another order. No matter what problems happen here in Qian, we don't need to report to Eme-an.",
  ["1001040601_48"]="Huh? Why is that?",
  ["1001040601_49"]="I have no clue. Master Yuanquan didn't give us an explanation.",
  ["1001040601_5"]="Qing! I'm back!",
  ["1001040601_50"]="Maybe Master Yuanquan has his own reasons?",
  ["1001040601_51"]="Well, since it's his order, we'll not inform Eme-an of the situation here... Besides, we can't get in touch with them even if we wanted to.",
  ["1001040601_52"]="I'm heading to the government to handle the isolation of the water source.",
  ["1001040601_53"]="The hologram dissipates, and the figures of the followers disappear one by one, returning the world before the Sower's eyes to normal—an ordinary white wall in a simple house.",
  ["1001040601_54"]="*yawn*",
  ["1001040601_55"]="A pitch-black figure enters the room, kneels down on one knee before the Sower, and respectfully lowers his head.",
  ["1001040601_56"]="Is everything on your end finished, Master?",
  ["1001040601_57"]="Yes. Did anything unusual happen during the meeting?",
  ["1001040601_58"]="No, all communications were transmitted through our encrypted channel.",
  ["1001040601_59"]="I've been keeping an eye on the signal transmissions, and there's been no indication of any monitoring or bugs.",
  ["1001040601_6"]="Calm down, Xin. How many times have I told you not to yell in public? Show some restraint, especially on important occasions.",
  ["1001040601_60"]="You seem a bit tired. Do you need a break?",
  ["1001040601_61"]="Don't worry. It's just old age catching up with me.",
  ["1001040601_62"]="But truth be told, I've been feeling tired more often lately. Maybe I don't have much time left.",
  ["1001040601_63"]="That's why I can't afford to rest at such a crucial moment.",
  ["1001040601_64"]="Go to the Bureau of Knowledge & Enlightenment and delete the records of the bandwidth usage during the meeting.",
  ["1001040601_65"]="I doubt the government staff will pay attention to the details, but I can't say the same for WeiShi.",
  ["1001040601_66"]="I don't want to attract any unnecessary attention from Yuanquan.",
  ["1001040601_67"]="Once you're done, come back.",
  ["1001040601_68"]="Consider it done.",
  ["1001040601_69"]="But Master, there's one thing I don't understand.",
  ["1001040601_7"]="Ugh, you start nagging as soon as I walk in the door. Fine, fine, I get it. Aren't you curious about what I've found?",
  ["1001040601_70"]="Shoot.",
  ["1001040601_71"]="Why would you collaborate with something as dishonorable as Nemesis?",
  ["1001040601_72"]="Heh, why do you call them \"dishonorable\"?",
  ["1001040601_73"]="Have you finally figured it out? Are you ready to take WeiShi's side?",
  ["1001040601_74"]="I have no intention of doing that, Master. Your enemies are my enemies, and I'll take down anyone who dares to stand against you.",
  ["1001040601_75"]="What a shame. Honestly, WeiShi is quite a decent organization, and it wouldn't be a bad choice if you wanted to work for them. It might even be more promising than running errands for me.",
  ["1001040601_76"]="My offer still stands. If you no longer wish to work for me, you're free to leave anytime.",
  ["1001040601_77"]="How could I ever abandon you, Master? Though my abilities might be insignificant, I'll repay your kindness with unwavering loyalty.",
  ["1001040601_78"]="I just don't understand why someone of your status, abilities, knowledge, and experience would choose to cooperate with the unworthy Nemesis.",
  ["1001040601_79"]="Your view of the world doesn't have to be influenced by me.",
  ["1001040601_8"]="Looks like you're pleased with your discoveries.",
  ["1001040601_80"]="Likewise, my view of the world doesn't have to be understood by you.",
  ["1001040601_81"]="The Beacons have fallen silent in recent decades.",
  ["1001040601_82"]="And the last thing I want to do requires the power of a Beacon.",
  ["1001040601_83"]="Retributor promised to inform me of the window when the Beacons will be reactivated, but only if I joined Nemesis.",
  ["1001040601_84"]="If I miss this opportunity, I doubt I'll get another chance before my time is up.",
  ["1001040601_85"]="To me, it's a fair deal. Both sides have shared interests for now, and that's all that matters.",
  ["1001040601_86"]="Nemesis has too many selfish, arrogant, and shameless members.",
  ["1001040601_87"]="Most of them, in my opinion, are nothing but greedy scum.",
  ["1001040601_88"]="I fear they may break their promise.",
  ["1001040601_89"]="You don't need to worry about that.",
  ["1001040601_9"]="Of course! I'm the first one back from the investigation, so now you can see who's got the skills and who's slacking off, right?",
  ["1001040601_90"]="Retributor kept his word. The Beacon in QingYu City is already active, and the Grandeur River will bring its blessings to all corners.",
  ["1001040601_91"]="Everything is going according to plan.",
  ["1001040601_92"]="During the meeting just now, I made it clear to the Nemesis members that no one should interfere with the events unfolding in Qian.",
  ["1001040601_93"]="This is a game between me and Yuanquan, and I don't want any external factors to disrupt it.",
  ["1001040601_94"]="The final battle is always more thrilling when it unfolds without interference.",
  ["1001040601_95"]="His gaze shifts to a distant place.",
  ["1001040601_96"]="Your task is to eliminate any unwelcome surprise factors.",
  ["1001040601_97"]="A true gentleman observes the game without uttering a word, and anyone who tries to disrupt this game must be silenced forever.",
  ["1001040601_98"]="As you wish.",
  ["1001040701_1"]="Qian",
  ["1001040701_10"]="Zero...",
  ["1001040701_100"]="So, you mean...",
  ["1001040701_101"]="...",
  ["1001040701_102"]="She stares at me intensely, and after what feels like forever, she gives up and shakes her head.",
  ["1001040701_103"]="Well, forget it. Since Zero chose you, there's no need for any tests or whatever.",
  ["1001040701_104"]="With that, she hands me something.",
  ["1001040701_105"]="What are these symbols?",
  ["1001040701_106"]="When I see the black seal in my hand, my heart skips a beat.",
  ["1001040701_107"]="A weird mix of emotions swells up inside me, filling my chest and bringing a strange sense of calm.",
  ["1001040701_108"]="This seal is pitch black. Even more bizarrely, my fingers can't feel its temperature or texture.",
  ["1001040701_109"]="With my limited knowledge, I can't think of any material that resembles the seal.",
  ["1001040701_11"]="Zero... Zero... Zero...",
  ["1001040701_110"]="This is the Beacon of the Library.",
  ["1001040701_111"]="You're saying this... this thing is the Beacon itself?",
  ["1001040701_112"]="But I thought the Beacon was that black monolith?",
  ["1001040701_113"]="Exactly. This is the real Beacon.",
  ["1001040701_114"]="The black monolith you saw is actually an extension of this seal, something like the imprint it leaves behind.",
  ["1001040701_115"]="Imagine this: when you press a seal on a clay tablet, it leaves different patterns on different parts of the tablet.",
  ["1001040701_116"]="If you just look at the tablet, you'd think one pattern is on one end and another pattern is on the other end.",
  ["1001040701_117"]="But on the roller, they're right next to each other, just like how everything in the universe is cleverly connected in some way.",
  ["1001040701_118"]="This is the true Beacon that connects everything within the Library of Babel.",
  ["1001040701_119"]="...",
  ["1001040701_12"]="A voice calls her name from the other side of the profound darkness.",
  ["1001040701_120"]="I found it next to you when I rescued you from Nemesis. Looks like they were after it, too.",
  ["1001040701_121"]="And now, I'm giving it back to you.",
  ["1001040701_122"]="So, [BBNAME], as the last director of Eme-an... what's your next move?",
  ["1001040701_123"]="My thoughts return to the present.",
  ["1001040701_124"]="How did I answer Zhantan's question back then?",
  ["1001040701_125"]="Please let me think about it.",
  ["1001040701_126"]="Zhantan didn't push me for an immediate answer when I said that.",
  ["1001040701_127"]="I see. You just woke up, and I shouldn't rush you to give an answer.",
  ["1001040701_128"]="Well, take your time and consider this matter before Zero wakes up. After all, she's the one who wants your answer the most.",
  ["1001040701_129"]="...",
  ["1001040701_13"]="At that moment, she finally remembers who she is.",
  ["1001040701_130"]="And so, she carried both Zero and me to her motorhome.",
  ["1001040701_131"]="I have no idea where this ride is headed or what we will do next. Honestly, I am not really in a mood to think about it now.",
  ["1001040701_132"]="My mind is consumed with one question: When will the girl ever wake up?",
  ["1001040701_133"]="Zhantan lets out a sigh.",
  ["1001040701_134"]="Fine, do whatever you want.",
  ["1001040701_135"]="She turns around and returns to the driving cab.",
  ["1001040701_136"]="The motorhome vibrates at a regular frequency. I lean against the bedside, and it doesn't take long for me to fall asleep.",
  ["1001040701_137"]="Bells.",
  ["1001040701_138"]="I hear the sound of bells.",
  ["1001040701_139"]="Subconsciously, I turn around, and my eyes catch sight of a gargantuan clock levitating in the void.",
  ["1001040701_14"]="Zero.",
  ["1001040701_140"]="Memories rush back to me like a flood.",
  ["1001040701_141"]="I have been in this place many times before. Every time I enter this space, the memories of my previous visits resurface in my mind.",
  ["1001040701_142"]="In that marvelous Library, every time I had the intention to scan for a certain sector, my consciousness would bring me to this place.",
  ["1001040701_143"]="However, every time I left this space, I would lose all memory of what had happened here. So I thought each scanning was only a fleeting moment.",
  ["1001040701_144"]="But this time, the golden figure that usually awaited me in this realm is nowhere to be found.",
  ["1001040701_145"]="Silence envelops the space, where its owner has departed, leaving me standing here alone.",
  ["1001040701_146"]="A subtle feeling of sorrow, like a slow trickle of water, begins to permeate my soul, spreading within my entire being.",
  ["1001040701_147"]="And then, a voice echoes in my ears.",
  ["1001040701_148"]="Fear not.",
  ["1001040701_149"]="The Library will always protect you.",
  ["1001040701_15"]="For this name, she holds no particular attachment or sentiment.",
  ["1001040701_150"]="Go back to where you should be right now.",
  ["1001040701_151"]="The texture beneath me feels so soft that I'm reluctant to open my eyes.",
  ["1001040701_152"]="I feel something warm in the center of my hand. It is the Beacon that I have been holding tightly. Its warmth gradually brings me back to consciousness.",
  ["1001040701_153"]="I struggle to lift my eyelids, and when I open my eyes, what I see is the white roof of the vehicle.",
  ["1001040701_154"]="Hmm? The white roof?",
  ["1001040701_155"]="It finally dawns on me that something is off.",
  ["1001040701_156"]="Why am I lying on a bed?",
  ["1001040701_157"]="At that moment, I hear the sound of fabric rustling around me.",
  ["1001040701_158"]="I hastily sit up, and my eyes meet a pair of golden eyes.",
  ["1001040701_159"]="...",
  ["1001040701_16"]="The body is the cage of the soul, and the name gives the cage a label.",
  ["1001040701_160"]="...",
  ["1001040701_161"]="Somehow, the girl who should have been lying on the bed, severely injured, is now sitting next to the bed, while I lie upon it.",
  ["1001040701_162"]="You...",
  ["1001040701_163"]="You're awake.",
  ["1001040701_164"]="I interrupt her question.",
  ["1001040701_165"]="A subtle silence falls between us.",
  ["1001040701_166"]="I immediately regret interrupting her.",
  ["1001040701_167"]="Zero is never one to feel embarrassed by moments of complete silence. She is naturally reserved and rarely initiates conversations unless it is necessary for exchanging information.",
  ["1001040701_168"]="The only person feeling suffocated by the awkward silence is likely myself.",
  ["1001040701_169"]="Seriously, why did I create this awkward atmosphere?",
  ["1001040701_17"]="Hence: \"All things have names. Names wield power, shaping their existence and binding their essence.\"",
  ["1001040701_170"]="Perhaps because I instinctively sensed that the question she intended to ask was something I didn't want to answer.",
  ["1001040701_171"]="I felt as if, at the moment of confrontation with her, her golden eyes had pierced through my inner vulnerabilities.",
  ["1001040701_172"]="Just as the dead silence becomes increasingly overwhelming and suffocating...",
  ["1001040701_173"]="Oh, finally awake?",
  ["1001040701_174"]="Zhantan shows up in the compartment and playfully addresses me.",
  ["1001040701_175"]="Don't get me wrong. I'm not talking about her. I'm talking about you.",
  ["1001040701_176"]="You're the caretaker, but you ended up hogging the patient's bed and slept well. Did you have a nice dream?",
  ["1001040701_177"]="The motorhome has stopped, and the drowsy bumps have ceased.",
  ["1001040701_178"]="I notice that Zhantan is holding a box in her hand.",
  ["1001040701_179"]="Now that Zero is awake, I suppose I can go now.",
  ["1001040701_18"]="In this manner, the name becomes the cage for the soul.",
  ["1001040701_180"]="I've talked to her about everything and sorted out your next steps.",
  ["1001040701_181"]="Anyway, you need a place to stay now. I've entered your destination into the navigation system, so just follow the map.",
  ["1001040701_182"]="I have some business to attend to, so I'll come back for you when I'm done.",
  ["1001040701_183"]="Business?",
  ["1001040701_184"]="Where are you going?",
  ["1001040701_185"]="Well, I won't go into all the details. Zero will explain it to you later.",
  ["1001040701_186"]="To QingYu City.",
  ["1001040701_187"]="QingYu City?",
  ["1001040701_188"]="Oh, yeah. Since you never asked me about it, I didn't say anything.",
  ["1001040701_189"]="We left Obed long ago, and now we're traveling in a new continent.",
  ["1001040701_19"]="Consequently, people bestow names with various meanings.",
  ["1001040701_190"]="She walks over to the bed and pulls open the curtains.",
  ["1001040701_191"]="Although the sun is hidden behind layers of clouds and there is still vapor in the distance, this vibrant land is so vast that every inch of soil shimmers with emerald radiance.",
  ["1001040701_192"]="Welcome to Qian.",
  ["1001040701_2"]="All that dwells here is complete darkness.",
  ["1001040701_20"]="Names can harbor blessings or curses.",
  ["1001040701_21"]="However, her name is bereft of all emotions. It is simply zero, utterly vacant and meaningless.",
  ["1001040701_22"]="No matter how much one chews on this word, one cannot taste any flavor.",
  ["1001040701_23"]="Yet, the voice calling her name carries so much tenderness.",
  ["1001040701_24"]="Merely being called, this insignificant name seems to be infused with indescribable emotions.",
  ["1001040701_25"]="No one has ever called her name in such a tone. Unable to restrain herself, she reaches out toward the origin of the voice.",
  ["1001040701_26"]="The motorhome glides smoothly along the highway.",
  ["1001040701_27"]="I walk into the rear compartment. If it weren't for the slight bumps, I could easily mistake it for a room in a hospital.",
  ["1001040701_28"]="The air carries the scent of medicine, and the vibrations of the vehicle cause the curtains to open slightly.",
  ["1001040701_29"]="Consequently, a delicate shimmering light seeps through the window, gently resting upon the girl's eyelashes.",
  ["1001040701_3"]="The encompassing darkness eliminates all senses, even enveloping thoughts and carrying them into the depths of unconsciousness.",
  ["1001040701_30"]="I approach her bed, close the curtains, and then settle down beside her, extending my hand to feel her breath.",
  ["1001040701_31"]="The warmth on my fingertips soothes my restless heart.",
  ["1001040701_32"]="The girl slumbers so peacefully that I can barely perceive the sound of her breathing. It feels as though she is not merely sleeping but entering an eternal dormancy, so I instinctively confirm that she is still alive.",
  ["1001040701_33"]="Sleep was once described as a small death, and life as an extended insomnia.",
  ["1001040701_34"]="This \"small death\" she is experiencing has lasted for far too long.",
  ["1001040701_35"]="Zero.",
  ["1001040701_36"]="I whisper into her ear.",
  ["1001040701_37"]="Zero...",
  ["1001040701_38"]="As I expected, she does not respond.",
  ["1001040701_39"]="At that moment, I hear another set of footsteps coming from behind.",
  ["1001040701_4"]="She cannot tell if she is standing still or if she is drifting with the flow in this darkness.",
  ["1001040701_40"]="Are you doing this again? You're amazingly persistent in some weird ways.",
  ["1001040701_41"]="Haven't I told you already? Her vitals are being monitored, and we'll know immediately if she wakes up. There's no point in guarding her bedside.",
  ["1001040701_42"]="Zhantan.",
  ["1001040701_43"]="This dark-haired woman holding a fan is named Zhantan.",
  ["1001040701_44"]="She was the first person I saw when I woke up two days ago.",
  ["1001040701_45"]="Oh? You're awake?",
  ["1001040701_46"]="I...",
  ["1001040701_47"]="You...",
  ["1001040701_48"]="I attempt to speak, but a searing pain radiates through my throat.",
  ["1001040701_49"]="Don't try talking. Take a sip of water first.",
  ["1001040701_5"]="All she desires is to let go of everything, surrendering to this vast emptiness reminiscent of amniotic fluid.",
  ["1001040701_50"]="I gulp down the water she hands me, and it soothes my dry throat.",
  ["1001040701_51"]="No need to explain or ask questions. Just listen to me for now.",
  ["1001040701_52"]="But before that, how should I address you?",
  ["1001040701_53"]="The prophecy Seer? One of the two survivors in the Tower of Babel? Or the last director of Eme-an?",
  ["1001040701_54"]="While her words may sound like questions, I instantly realize that she is not expecting answers form me.",
  ["1001040701_55"]="Instead, she is simply using those titles to remind me of what happened.",
  ["1001040701_56"]="Where... is Zero?",
  ["1001040701_57"]="She studies my expression and then smiles.",
  ["1001040701_58"]="Don't worry. She's safe for now. But Zero took a bold step to protect you, one that almost cost her life. You can thank her when she wakes up.",
  ["1001040701_59"]="Anyway, since you don't seem to like any of those titles, I'll just call you [BBNAME].",
  ["1001040701_6"]="She feels as though she is simultaneously falling and soaring through the air.",
  ["1001040701_60"]="A name feels more personal than a title, don't you think?",
  ["1001040701_61"]="You can call me Zhantan, the same Zhantan from the poem: \"Atop Zhantan Pavilion, I pen poems with delight. On Parrot Island, I immerse in wine's respite.\"",
  ["1001040701_62"]="Let me catch you up on what has happened so far.",
  ["1001040701_63"]="Zhantan claims to be a member of Eme-an.",
  ["1001040701_64"]="According to her, she was the one who saved both Zero and me from the ruined Tower of Babel.",
  ["1001040701_65"]="So, that's what went down in the Library of Babel.",
  ["1001040701_66"]="The God of the Sun, the prophecy, Oedipus's tragedy, and Nemesis...",
  ["1001040701_67"]="However, as I narrate my story, her face remains surprisingly calm, as if the Tower, destroyed by a nuclear explosion, has nothing to do with her.",
  ["1001040701_68"]="So, when I received Viola's message, I had a feeling that something big was about to happen. And when it actually did, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions.",
  ["1001040701_69"]="Viola?",
  ["1001040701_7"]="Like a rudderless boat or a kite with a broken string.",
  ["1001040701_70"]="Where is she?",
  ["1001040701_71"]="Oh, right, Viola.",
  ["1001040701_72"]="Nanna told her to leave early, and that's how I found out about you.",
  ["1001040701_73"]="Unfortunately, I only received a message from her, saying that Eme-an would have a new director. So I came back here in a hurry, and you know what happened next: I found you and Zero among the ruins.",
  ["1001040701_74"]="Where are Nanna and Shamash?",
  ["1001040701_75"]="Unfortunately, like I said, I found only you and Zero among the ruins.",
  ["1001040701_76"]="And Ereshan... wasn't there, right?",
  ["1001040701_77"]="I don't think I need to repeat myself a third time.",
  ["1001040701_78"]="...",
  ["1001040701_79"]="You seem surprisingly calm about all this.",
  ["1001040701_8"]="Everything about me will drift in this nothingness until I fade away.",
  ["1001040701_80"]="Emotionally, I don't have a deep connection with them, so I won't shed tears over their departure.",
  ["1001040701_81"]="And logically, I wouldn't advise you to get too sentimental either.",
  ["1001040701_82"]="Who knows? Maybe they're not dead at all.",
  ["1001040701_83"]="What does that mean?",
  ["1001040701_84"]="I mean, literally.",
  ["1001040701_85"]="The Library of Babel hasn't been destroyed, and it can't be destroyed.",
  ["1001040701_86"]="If a tiny explosion could simply wipe out such an anomaly, why would we have spent thousands of years overseeing it?",
  ["1001040701_87"]="In Qian, we have a parable about blind people trying to figure out what an elephant looks like.",
  ["1001040701_88"]="Each blind person touches a different part of the elephant, and when they put it all together, they realize that an elephant is something round and thick, thin and long, and flat and wide. They call it an \"elephant\" even though none of them can grasp the whole picture.",
  ["1001040701_89"]="Similarly, the Library only shows you a glimpse of its endless contents.",
  ["1001040701_9"]="In that instant, someone grasps the string of the kite.",
  ["1001040701_90"]="Imagine the Beacon as a power source and the Tower of Babel as a computer. When the Beacon is activated, it's like booting up a computer named the Tower of Babel connected to a server called the Library of Babel.",
  ["1001040701_91"]="The God of the Sun only destroyed the space where the Beacon was located, a joint created by the Beacon between reality and the Library.",
  ["1001040701_92"]="But it was a nuclear explosion.",
  ["1001040701_93"]="Well, would the collapse of a star even matter to the whole universe?",
  ["1001040701_94"]="Zhantan waves her fan.",
  ["1001040701_95"]="While the connection is severed, the Library of Babel endures.",
  ["1001040701_96"]="While the impact might seem mind-blowing, in the infinite rooms within the Library, it's like a tiny speck floating in an endless ocean—it won't even cause a ripple.",
  ["1001040701_97"]="And those who were stuck within the Library might have no clue about what happened at all.",
  ["1001040701_98"]="So basically, the impact closed its gate to reality temporarily. As long as the Beacon is still there, the Library will reappear when the Beacon is reactivated.",
  ["1001040701_99"]="As long as the Beacon is still there?",
  ["1001040801_1"]="The Cerulean Vapor",
  ["1001040801_10"]="Unlike the devout Japheth, Qian doesn't have any religious traditions.",
  ["1001040801_100"]="As the sun moves towards the western horizon, dusk gradually envelops the surroundings.",
  ["1001040801_101"]="A faint vapor seems to emanate from the dense trees on both sides of the road.",
  ["1001040801_102"]="As twilight deepens, the vapor thickens, likely due to the dropping temperature.",
  ["1001040801_103"]="The streetlights illuminate the surroundings, but within the vapor, their glow appears dim, resembling faintly glowing jellyfish swimming in the depths of the sea.",
  ["1001040801_104"]="What's wrong?",
  ["1001040801_105"]="Anything unusual?",
  ["1001040801_106"]="The color of the vapor.",
  ["1001040801_107"]="As she mentions it, I notice a faint cerulean hue in the vapor ahead of the headlights.",
  ["1001040801_108"]="I've never encountered fog of this color before, nor have I read about anything similar in those books.",
  ["1001040801_109"]="What's worse, the vapor has been thickening.",
  ["1001040801_11"]="Unlike the stalwart Cyril, Qian doesn't possess a fervor for power.",
  ["1001040801_110"]="Our visibility has dropped from 120 meters to 60 meters.",
  ["1001040801_111"]="Let's slow down.",
  ["1001040801_112"]="Soon, darkness engulfs our surroundings.",
  ["1001040801_113"]="Only two beams of light from the car's headlights pierce through the vapor.",
  ["1001040801_114"]="As Zero mentioned, even these columns of light are gradually diminishing.",
  ["1001040801_115"]="The streetlights on both sides of the road have shrunk to flickering will-o'-the-wisps.",
  ["1001040801_116"]="Keep the speed. Don't stop.",
  ["1001040801_117"]="The color of the vapor continues to intensify to the point where it cannot be ignored.",
  ["1001040801_118"]="Like a thin layer of paint, it coats everything outside the windows with a cerulean tint.",
  ["1001040801_119"]="The headlights now only illuminate less than 10 meters ahead.",
  ["1001040801_12"]="And unlike the small land of Delphi, Qian is so vast that it is still night in the west when the sun rises in the east.",
  ["1001040801_120"]="Nevertheless, the diffused light is sufficient to outline the shadows of the trees lining the roadside.",
  ["1001040801_121"]="The road lies eerily quiet, devoid of any other vehicles. We are the sole travelers, resembling a ship traversing through a thick fog.",
  ["1001040801_122"]="The undulating, jagged silhouettes of the trees silently loom over us, stirring up a sense of unease in my heart.",
  ["1001040801_123"]="Should we... stop here?",
  ["1001040801_124"]="This vapor is most likely some kind of anomaly or, at the very least, an indirect effect of it, and we have entered it.",
  ["1001040801_125"]="We have no clues about this anomaly. If we stop here, it is possible that we may never get out of the vapor.",
  ["1001040801_126"]="Let's continue forward as long as there are no obvious obstacles.",
  ["1001040801_127"]="Time passes in an uncanny silence until...",
  ["1001040801_128"]="Stop!",
  ["1001040801_129"]="But it is already too late. Before I can execute Zero's command, I see a massive shadow emerge in front of the headlights.",
  ["1001040801_13"]="Qian encompasses a comprehensive world with its own culture, history, and customs.",
  ["1001040801_130"]="Moo!",
  ["1001040801_131"]="In the next instant, I experience a head-on collision. Darkness descends as my face makes impact with the airbag from the steering wheel.",
  ["1001040801_132"]="A disorienting spin follows, as if the entire car has tumbled, followed by an unending sensation of falling.",
  ["1001040801_133"]="After what feels like a minute, or perhaps a year, the world finally stops spinning, and tranquility settles in.",
  ["1001040801_14"]="However, in recent times, Qian has undergone dramatic changes and a period of turmoil that marked the end of thousands of years of its imperial rule and the rise of a modern society.",
  ["1001040801_15"]="Nowadays, Qian is completely different from its past. It's best to see it for yourself. Otherwise, it would require extensive scholarly works to fully explain.",
  ["1001040801_16"]="As for CangLin City, it's the largest agricultural production center in Qian.",
  ["1001040801_17"]="The Grandeur River traverses the entirety of Qian from east to west, nourishing lives in the vast Fertile Plains.",
  ["1001040801_18"]="CangLin City is located in the heart of the Fertile Plains. As its name implies, it's the granary of this nation. It has fully utilized automatic agricultural systems and serves as a testing ground for new crops and cultivation techniques.",
  ["1001040801_19"]="The revitalized Qian has been purged of the remnants and contaminations of the past.",
  ["1001040801_2"]="After Zhantan leaves, only Zero and I remain in the motorhome.",
  ["1001040801_20"]="It's a city deeply connected to its land, to the culture of Qian, and to its people. Even if some force were to relocate the city to another corner of the world overnight, it would inevitably return to Qian, to the banks of the Grandeur River.",
  ["1001040801_21"]="Only there, would it truly regain its essence.",
  ["1001040801_22"]="Your destination is CangLin City, where WeiShi is located. I've already informed my colleagues, so once you arrive in CangLin City, our colleagues will come and pick you up.",
  ["1001040801_23"]="Aren't you coming with us?",
  ["1001040801_24"]="You're not infants in need of constant care, and I have my own business to attend to.",
  ["1001040801_25"]="No need to worry. The moment you set foot in Qian, you're under the protection of WeiShi.",
  ["1001040801_26"]="No matter what choice you may make, you'll always be our esteemed guests.",
  ["1001040801_27"]="Rest assured. No one will be able to harm our guests in this land.",
  ["1001040801_28"]="The sudden braking interrupts my memories.",
  ["1001040801_29"]="What's going on?",
  ["1001040801_3"]="The vehicle continues in autopilot mode towards its destination, while the precious silence envelops the two of us once again.",
  ["1001040801_30"]="Did we hit something?",
  ["1001040801_31"]="Something appears to be wrong with the autopilot system.",
  ["1001040801_32"]="She glances at the vehicle's control system and cautiously fiddles with the interface above her.",
  ["1001040801_33"]="...",
  ["1001040801_34"]="It is malfunctioning.",
  ["1001040801_35"]="So, what do we do now?",
  ["1001040801_36"]="Zero rummages through the toolbox and finds what looks like a driver's manual, quickly flipping through its pages.",
  ["1001040801_37"]="She swiftly skims through the book and finishes reading the rather thick manual in just five minutes.",
  ["1001040801_38"]="I can switch it to manual mode.",
  ["1001040801_39"]="Wait, you actually know how to drive?",
  ["1001040801_4"]="Looking out the window at the greenery, I mutter the name of the land.",
  ["1001040801_40"]="...",
  ["1001040801_41"]="I've read about these machines in books before, and I just finished going through the manual.",
  ["1001040801_42"]="But wait...",
  ["1001040801_43"]="Before I can even finish my sentence, Zero is already in the driver's seat, ready to take control.",
  ["1001040801_44"]="First, I should start this thing up and... huh?",
  ["1001040801_45"]="The engine makes a rather ominous noise.",
  ["1001040801_46"]="...",
  ["1001040801_47"]="...",
  ["1001040801_48"]="Hmm, let's start over again. Pull this lever and then that one...",
  ["1001040801_49"]="The vehicle lurches forward and then comes to an abrupt stop once more.",
  ["1001040801_5"]="Qian.",
  ["1001040801_50"]="Maybe we should just forget about it...",
  ["1001040801_51"]="Theoretically, it should work perfectly. The principle and the order of operations are crystal clear to me.",
  ["1001040801_52"]="...",
  ["1001040801_53"]="...",
  ["1001040801_54"]="A fluffy ball pops out from under Zero's cloak and lands on the steering wheel.",
  ["1001040801_55"]="Chirp! Stop being reckless, Missy! You've never left the Tower or driven a car in your life! Trying it now will only turn this motorhome into our coffin!",
  ["1001040801_56"]="...",
  ["1001040801_57"]="Wait, you're still alive?!",
  ["1001040801_58"]="Ouch, that stings! Why the surprised look?! A cute bird like me is naturally alive and well, right? I mean, who'd have the heart to let me die? That's unthinkable!",
  ["1001040801_59"]="Well, as a loyal pet of our dear Missy, who knows nothing about the world, I've grown accustomed to shielding her from the impact of a nuclear explosion every now and then. It's just part of my daily routine now...",
  ["1001040801_6"]="Qian...",
  ["1001040801_60"]="Do you understand what Ann is talking about?",
  ["1001040801_61"]="Oops, looks like she's figured that out.",
  ["1001040801_62"]="Anchirp deftly dodges Zero's hand and gracefully lands on my head.",
  ["1001040801_63"]="Whatever! Just listen to my command!",
  ["1001040801_64"]="You, Missy! Take the passenger seat and behave yourself!",
  ["1001040801_65"]="And you, pesky fool! Yeah, I'm talking to you! Come and sit in the driver's seat! Let this cute, smart, and charming little bird teach you how to drive!",
  ["1001040801_66"]="With Anchirp's guidance, the vehicle starts moving slowly towards our destination.",
  ["1001040801_67"]="Don't pay any attention to what it said. It's just a silly bird with a brain the size of a walnut.",
  ["1001040801_68"]="Chirp? Chirp... Wait, what?!",
  ["1001040801_69"]="I can't believe it. Am I nothing more than a silly bird to you? You used to tell me how lonely you felt on those melancholy nights...",
  ["1001040801_7"]="Where should I start?",
  ["1001040801_70"]="Anchirp once again manages to slip away from Zero's grasp.",
  ["1001040801_71"]="Hey, now that's going too far! I didn't teach you to be such a rude girl! Are you taking it out on me just because you're feeling uneasy? That's not fair!",
  ["1001040801_72"]="Shut up, Ann!",
  ["1001040801_73"]="Nah! I've had enough! I'm angry! Even a sweet and adorable little bird like me can get angry, you know!",
  ["1001040801_74"]="You're angry because you feel so helpless after the downfall of Eme-an! And now you're desperately trying to prove yourself, pretending you can do everything, but deep down, you're just afraid that [BBNAME] might leave you behind!",
  ["1001040801_75"]="But you know what? You're just a clueless girl who has never set foot outside the Tower! You have no idea how to operate any machinery! And you lack even basic social skills!",
  ["1001040801_76"]="...!",
  ["1001040801_77"]="Zero whips out her wand and swiftly knocks Angel down, then tosses it out the window like it is trash.",
  ["1001040801_78"]="Her movements are quick and decisive, without any hesitation.",
  ["1001040801_79"]="Is it... alright...?",
  ["1001040801_8"]="This name represents both a nation and a civilization as well as a reference to its long history.",
  ["1001040801_80"]="...",
  ["1001040801_81"]="Don't worry. That thing is practically unkillable, if nothing else.",
  ["1001040801_82"]="...",
  ["1001040801_83"]="Just forget everything it said. Pretend you didn't hear it.",
  ["1001040801_84"]="Fine.",
  ["1001040801_85"]="I don't have the guts to say \"no\" to her.",
  ["1001040801_86"]="However...",
  ["1001040801_87"]="You're angry because you feel so helpless after the downfall of Eme-an! And now you're desperately trying to prove yourself, pretending you can do everything, but deep down, you're just afraid that [BBNAME] might leave you behind!",
  ["1001040801_88"]="But what it just said...",
  ["1001040801_89"]="Zero gives me a stern look, indicating that further discussion on the topic would result in my removal from the vehicle, similar to how she dealt with the bird.",
  ["1001040801_9"]="Unlike the young Polestar, Qian is one of the most ancient countries in the world.",
  ["1001040801_90"]="...",
  ["1001040801_91"]="Zhantan has told me about the Tower of Babel and Eme-an. Apart from the Eme-an on duty outside the Tower, we are the only survivors of that incident.",
  ["1001040801_92"]="Now Eme-an no longer exists, both in name and reality. However, we are fortunate to receive assistance from WeiShi.",
  ["1001040801_93"]="WeiShi?",
  ["1001040801_94"]="Yes, Zhantan is from WeiShi. More precisely, she belongs to both Eme-an and WeiShi, serving as a bridge between us.",
  ["1001040801_95"]="WeiShi is a member of C.A.V.E. Just as Eme-an has been watching over Obed, WeiShi has been protecting Qian in the east.",
  ["1001040801_96"]="However, according to her, WeiShi is currently facing unexpected situations as well.",
  ["1001040801_97"]="Is it something like an anomaly?",
  ["1001040801_98"]="Hmm.",
  ["1001040801_99"]="After she responds, she glances out the window vigilantly, as if she notices something unusual.",
  ["1001040901_1"]="Nong Ji",
  ["1001040901_10"]="The vapor thickens, becoming more humid, and I struggle to determine if it is the vapor or my blood making my skin sticky.",
  ["1001040901_100"]="What happened to Zero? Is she still trapped in the vapor?",
  ["1001040901_101"]="Sleeping is out of the question. I decide against taking a walk outside to calm my mind.",
  ["1001040901_102"]="...",
  ["1001040901_103"]="*cough* *cough*",
  ["1001040901_104"]="I notice a figure sitting in the dark hallway.",
  ["1001040901_105"]="Who are you?",
  ["1001040901_106"]="Who's there?",
  ["1001040901_107"]="The light switches on.",
  ["1001040901_108"]="I thought only old folks like me struggled with sleep.",
  ["1001040901_109"]="Oh, don't worry about me. It's just that my aging body has been letting me down more and more.",
  ["1001040901_11"]="A faint light hangs in the distance, possibly the moon, but instead of illuminating the darkness, it just adds to the eerie atmosphere.",
  ["1001040901_110"]="Is the bed too hard for you to sleep on?",
  ["1001040901_111"]="No, I'm worried about my companion.",
  ["1001040901_112"]="No, it's just that something's been bothering me.",
  ["1001040901_113"]="Well then, have a seat for a bit.",
  ["1001040901_114"]="I've got some grapes here. I picked them from the field before the Cerulean Vapor rolled in. Give them a try.",
  ["1001040901_115"]="By the way, what's your name?",
  ["1001040901_116"]="(Tell him your name.)",
  ["1001040901_117"]="My name is Nong Ji.",
  ["1001040901_118"]="I've been working with crops my whole life. Now that I'm retired, I tend to my garden at home.",
  ["1001040901_119"]="You've come from far away, haven't you?",
  ["1001040901_12"]="I call out for Zero multiple times, but my shouts disappear into the vast darkness without an echo.",
  ["1001040901_120"]="Exactly.",
  ["1001040901_121"]="I'm not entirely sure...",
  ["1001040901_122"]="If you're here for sightseeing, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. CangLin City has surely seen better days.",
  ["1001040901_123"]="Why does this have to happen before autumn? Oh well, it's rare to have a guest here. Let's not dwell on disappointing matters. How do the grapes taste?",
  ["1001040901_124"]="They're quite... unique.",
  ["1001040901_125"]="Feels like each one has its own distinct flavor.",
  ["1001040901_126"]="Oh, really?",
  ["1001040901_127"]="Surprised by my answer, the old man picks two grapes and tastes them.",
  ["1001040901_128"]="Hmm... seems the hybrid traits of strains A-475 and C-377 aren't stable enough.",
  ["1001040901_129"]="Well, the issue probably lies in the ratio of glucose to tartaric acid. I should reevaluate the offspring in the next batch.",
  ["1001040901_13"]="Despite my efforts to remain composed, fear seeps in, sending shivers up my spine.",
  ["1001040901_130"]="Are you a botanist?",
  ["1001040901_131"]="Do you study plants?",
  ["1001040901_132"]="Yeah, I've been doing that my whole life. Even after retiring, I couldn't just sit around, so I decided to plant a few acres of my own land and do some experiments.",
  ["1001040901_133"]="Sorry for making you eat the new varieties from my experiments. But rest assured, these grapes are safe and haven't been contaminated.",
  ["1001040901_134"]="Well, I've grown several traditional varieties suitable for entertaining guests, but they won't ripen for a few more months.",
  ["1001040901_135"]="But ever since the Cerulean Vapor spread across the river, my grapes stopped growing.",
  ["1001040901_136"]="My six acres of Type-9 and nine acres of Type-5 mother parents and four acres of Type-A and eight acres of Type-E father parents, along with the seventy-one acres of experimental plots from cross-breeding... A total of one hundred acres is on the brink of losing its harvest!",
  ["1001040901_137"]="You're cultivating such a huge area all by yourself?",
  ["1001040901_138"]="Wait, you call that \"a few acres\"?",
  ["1001040901_139"]="Hah, compared to the whole city, this is just a small garden.",
  ["1001040901_14"]="What should I do now?",
  ["1001040901_140"]="You'll see in the morning: the entire Fertile Plains is our farmland. Now, that's what I call spectacular, the real granary of the world.",
  ["1001040901_141"]="But of course, I'm not farming on my own. I'm an old man after all.",
  ["1001040901_142"]="Look over there, outside the window. Can you see it?",
  ["1001040901_143"]="Following Nong Ji's gesture, I faintly make out a row of tower-like shadows illuminated by the moonlight.",
  ["1001040901_144"]="Those are tower-type farming terminals, serving as part of the centralized agricultural system of this city.",
  ["1001040901_145"]="With those machines, one farmer could cultivate nearly two thousand acres of land. Those machines will take care of sowing, irrigation, pesticide application, and harvesting, and all we need to do is connect it to the various subsystems based on the seasons.",
  ["1001040901_146"]="So usually, I only need to visit the fields every now and then and take samples for analysis, while the machine handles the rest.",
  ["1001040901_147"]="But now, with the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture suspending production, these machines won't be much help. The government is completely focused on grain distribution and transportation.",
  ["1001040901_148"]="Will there be a famine?",
  ["1001040901_149"]="Will the crops fail?",
  ["1001040901_15"]="This is the first time I realize how limited my knowledge of the world is.",
  ["1001040901_150"]="Let's hope it won't come to that. But then again, we Qian people have always been good at saving for rainy days and preparing for the worst.",
  ["1001040901_151"]="I saw a famine with my own eyes. It was fifteen years ago, in the Western Region.",
  ["1001040901_152"]="You look young and like you're not from around here, so maybe you're not familiar with that part of our history.",
  ["1001040901_153"]="But my generation will never forget those haunting images.",
  ["1001040901_154"]="Farming in the past was backbreaking work, without all these fancy machines we have today.",
  ["1001040901_155"]="Back then, people went to great lengths, even risking their lives, just to put food on the table.",
  ["1001040901_156"]="I hope the younger generation gets to live in a world where they're spared from the hardships we endured.",
  ["1001040901_157"]="Those machines you just saw give us a glimpse of that dream coming true.",
  ["1001040901_158"]="Thanks to them, the younger people don't have to suffer from the early calluses on their shoulders and hands caused by life's hardships.",
  ["1001040901_159"]="Ideally, those machines would be running nonstop, but now... Well, whatever is happening in CangLin City, I just hope things settle down soon.",
  ["1001040901_16"]="Which direction should I go?",
  ["1001040901_160"]="After all, farming season doesn't wait for anyone. Daylight and rain follow their own rhythms, and if we miss the right timing, we miss the harvest.",
  ["1001040901_17"]="After some hesitation, I follow my intuition and choose a direction that seems to lead me back to where I came from.",
  ["1001040901_18"]="The summer field resembles a humid swamp, causing my feet to sink into the grass. It feels as though invisible fingers tug at my shoes and pants.",
  ["1001040901_19"]="The Cerulean Vapor clings to the air, making it increasingly difficult to breathe.",
  ["1001040901_2"]="The world spins, and a cacophony of crashing, dizziness, and pain assault my senses, plunging me into darkness.",
  ["1001040901_20"]="A growing sense of unease envelops me as grotesque silhouettes emerge from the vapor. Some resemble mutilated figures and others indescribable entities.",
  ["1001040901_21"]="Where am I headed now?",
  ["1001040901_22"]="Am I retracing my steps or venturing deeper into the mountains?",
  ["1001040901_23"]="Or worse, am I unknowingly walking toward the bottomless Grandeur River?",
  ["1001040901_24"]="At that moment, a silhouette within the vapor starts to move.",
  ["1001040901_25"]="I freeze, my hairs standing on end, fixing my gaze on the silhouette, hoping it is just swaying grass.",
  ["1001040901_26"]="But to my dismay, it continues to move, accompanied by a faint rustling sound that grows closer by the moment.",
  ["1001040901_27"]="Should I run or scream? My brain falters, leaving me helpless as the silhouette looms larger in my vision.",
  ["1001040901_28"]="It is the silhouette of a human but with an otherworldly face.",
  ["1001040901_29"]="The person raises their hand, removes something from their face, and approaches me.",
  ["1001040901_3"]="Finally, the falling sensation ends, and I feel the moist, soft touch of the summer soil beneath me. A warm liquid trickles down my skin.",
  ["1001040901_30"]="I stand frozen as the person brings their hand up to cover my face with something.",
  ["1001040901_31"]="Suddenly, my breathing becomes easier as a weight presses against my face.",
  ["1001040901_32"]="I reach out and realize it is a mask.",
  ["1001040901_33"]="A gas mask.",
  ["1001040901_34"]="The mask eases my breathing and alleviates the hallucinations caused by oxygen deprivation. I carefully observe the stranger who has helped me in the dense vapor.",
  ["1001040901_35"]="His gaze is calm and kind, devoid of any hostility.",
  ["1001040901_36"]="Just as I am about to speak, he shakes his head and places a finger on his lips, signaling for silence.",
  ["1001040901_37"]="A rustling sound emerges from the depths of the vapor: something is stirring behind the rice fields.",
  ["1001040901_38"]="He gestures for me to follow and proceeds forward.",
  ["1001040901_39"]="After a moment of hesitation, I decide to follow him.",
  ["1001040901_4"]="It feels as though my every joint has been brutally loosened by a screw driver, leaving me gasping for breath. After a while, I manage to stand up.",
  ["1001040901_40"]="The streetlights in the darkness gradually grow brighter.",
  ["1001040901_41"]="It is not due to an increase in their power, but rather because the thick vapor that had enveloped the area is dissipating.",
  ["1001040901_42"]="Good, now we can talk.",
  ["1001040901_43"]="The stranger removes his mask.",
  ["1001040901_44"]="The government has imposed a ban on going outside, and ordinary people like you must not wander around at such late hours. What exactly happened that you had to come out?",
  ["1001040901_45"]="Well... wait... you're not from Qian, are you?",
  ["1001040901_46"]="He seems to have noticed that I am not dressed like a typical resident.",
  ["1001040901_47"]="I'm here on a trip.",
  ["1001040901_48"]="I'm here for business.",
  ["1001040901_49"]="I explain about the car accident on the road to CangLin City.",
  ["1001040901_5"]="Was I ejected from the car?",
  ["1001040901_50"]="I see. I'm sorry if I frightened you. I guess my tone was a bit too harsh...",
  ["1001040901_51"]="With a tinge of regret, he crouches down and attempts to inspect the bruise on my leg from the accident.",
  ["1001040901_52"]="Can you still walk?",
  ["1001040901_53"]="I politely decline his offer of assistance, preferring to remain cautious when dealing with a stranger.",
  ["1001040901_54"]="Sensing my hesitation, he refrains from making any further gestures and maintains a respectful distance.",
  ["1001040901_55"]="You're not aware of the current situation. I'm afraid CangLin City has been under quarantine for over a week now.",
  ["1001040901_56"]="Under quarantine?",
  ["1001040901_57"]="What's happening here?",
  ["1001040901_58"]="We're not sure about the details.",
  ["1001040901_59"]="But according to the government, the Grandeur River has been contaminated by an unknown substance, leading to a pandemic affecting both plants and animals.",
  ["1001040901_6"]="Upon inspecting my body, I notice scrapes and bruises on my arms and legs, but thankfully, no broken bones or severe injuries.",
  ["1001040901_60"]="The animals have gone wild... As for the plants, as you can see, they are covered in weird \"rust.\"",
  ["1001040901_61"]="Now is the transition from summer to fall, and autumn vapor rises. The pollutants have dispersed into the air, so the government has banned anyone from going outside.",
  ["1001040901_62"]="Who might you be?",
  ["1001040901_63"]="My name is Wushi, and I'm one of the vigilantes here.",
  ["1001040901_64"]="Vigilantes?",
  ["1001040901_65"]="Since this area is located on the outskirts with scattered residents, and most of the affected animals roam in the wilderness, we farmers have organized vigilante squads to take turns patrolling this area.",
  ["1001040901_66"]="This is to ensure everyone obeys the curfew and prevent wild animals from attacking people.",
  ["1001040901_67"]="I'm afraid your vehicle was attacked by oxen.",
  ["1001040901_68"]="I had a companion with me. Could you please...?",
  ["1001040901_69"]="Upon hearing my plea, Wushi shakes his head.",
  ["1001040901_7"]="I find myself in a wild field, where the abundant grass and trees have softened the impact of the fall.",
  ["1001040901_70"]="The vapor is too thick, and you're wounded. It's not safe to stay outside.",
  ["1001040901_71"]="I'll report your situation to the Bureau of Civil Security and ask them to search for your companion. Don't worry. They're professionals, and your companion will be safe and sound.",
  ["1001040901_72"]="I'll take you to my friend's house so you can settle down. We'll have to wait for the vapor to disperse before we can do anything.",
  ["1001040901_73"]="Accompanied by Wushi, we arrive at a small residence.",
  ["1001040901_74"]="Wushi presses the doorbell, and shortly afterward, a faint cough is heard from behind the door.",
  ["1001040901_75"]="*cough* Who's there? At this late hour?",
  ["1001040901_76"]="An old man with grizzled hair opens the door.",
  ["1001040901_77"]="Upon seeing Wushi and me in our current state, he appears surprised as he steps aside to let us in.",
  ["1001040901_78"]="Come on in.",
  ["1001040901_79"]="After Wushi enters the house, the two of them go into the kitchen, engaging in a hushed conversation.",
  ["1001040901_8"]="However, when I look up, all I see is darkness stretching indefinitely, accompanied by an eerie silence.",
  ["1001040901_80"]="Taking this moment, I look around.",
  ["1001040901_81"]="The furniture is unremarkable, consisting of typical Qian-style tables and chairs. On the tables, there are scattered papers that appear to be sketches, depicting crops rather than ornamental flowers.",
  ["1001040901_82"]="Wushi walks out of the kitchen.",
  ["1001040901_83"]="Please stay here for a while. Mr. Nong has already informed the Bureau of Civil Security about your situation, and they'll send someone to pick you up at dawn.",
  ["1001040901_84"]="Wushi puts his mask back on and heads towards the door.",
  ["1001040901_85"]="Wait, where are you going?",
  ["1001040901_86"]="I'm going to search the area where your car crashed and see if I can find your companion.",
  ["1001040901_87"]="He walks out of the door. As I stand up, attempting to follow him, the old man comes out of the kitchen and scolds me.",
  ["1001040901_88"]="*cough* Why are young people these days so reckless? Don't push your luck. You're wounded.",
  ["1001040901_89"]="He places a first aid kit on the table and firmly holds me down, tending to my wounds.",
  ["1001040901_9"]="I cannot see any cars or find the way back. There are no lights and no traces of Zero.",
  ["1001040901_90"]="He told me about your situation. Don't worry. He has a kind soul and is skilled in combat. Since he's promised to look for your companion, he will do it.",
  ["1001040901_91"]="The old man's hands are noticeably frail. The occasional coughing that fills the air causes him to stoop, as if the weight of years has transformed from mere wrinkles on his forehead into a tangible burden resting on his shoulders.",
  ["1001040901_92"]="He appears more fragile than someone who, like myself, has just been through a car accident. I give up the idea of breaking free from his grasp, fearing it may cause him harm.",
  ["1001040901_93"]="You look tired, young adventurer.",
  ["1001040901_94"]="You must have experienced a lot, but you don't need to tell me anything for now. Just go to bed and sleep, and we can talk when you wake up tomorrow.",
  ["1001040901_95"]="When you're tired, sleep is the best remedy.",
  ["1001040901_96"]="It is already late into the night.",
  ["1001040901_97"]="A place so close to the river and fields would typically be filled with the sounds of cicadas and frogs.",
  ["1001040901_98"]="However, as I listen, there is nothing but an eerie silence. It's unusually quiet for a summer night.",
  ["1001040901_99"]="The stale air inside the house reminds me of the mysterious vapor, as if I am once again enveloped by it, suffocating.",
  ["1001041001_1"]="Reunion",
  ["1001041001_10"]="Has Logos returned to Delphi with the samples?",
  ["1001041001_11"]="The samples have already been sent to the Delphic Oracle for examination, but their progress has been slow.",
  ["1001041001_12"]="What's worse, the influences on the residents of CangLin City have intensified.",
  ["1001041001_13"]="While those symptoms cannot be perceived by ordinary people, we see it clearly that the skin of affected patients gradually takes on an unhealthy cerulean hue, similar to the infected crops.",
  ["1001041001_14"]="Moreover, the affected livestock and wild animals pose another problem.",
  ["1001041001_15"]="According to our records, we have received over 1,600 reports of abnormal behavior in our breeding centers and observation nodes, and that's only accounting for witnessed cases.",
  ["1001041001_16"]="Over the past week, the number of such reports has been increasing at an alarming rate of 10 percent per day.",
  ["1001041001_17"]="Many are calling for a complete quarantine of the breeding areas, which I'm sure you're already aware of. The Bureau of Health & Welfare must be overwhelmed by now.",
  ["1001041001_18"]="It's been a week since Master Yuanquan left CangLin City...",
  ["1001041001_19"]="Is the situation in QingYu City truly that dire? Can't even Master Yuanquan resolve it?",
  ["1001041001_2"]="I've been monitoring the government's actions, and nothing unusual has happened so far.",
  ["1001041001_20"]="In that case, it seems we'll have to postpone this year's Harvest Festival.",
  ["1001041001_21"]="A sensible decision, but the Harvest Festival is the most important event of the year in CangLin City.",
  ["1001041001_22"]="It's not just a festival. It carries the prayers of countless people and is deeply intertwined with their daily lives.",
  ["1001041001_23"]="Postponing the festival will undoubtedly upset everyone.",
  ["1001041001_24"]="I understand, but the urgency of the situation demands it. I'll discuss the matter with my colleagues in the government tomorrow.",
  ["1001041001_25"]="Perhaps we should announce the postponement at a later time? Announcing it now might unsettle people and potentially lead to widespread panic.",
  ["1001041001_26"]="At a later time? When will it be then?",
  ["1001041001_27"]="The longer we delay the announcement, the more suspicion and rumors will spread. Once we've made the decision to postpone the Festival, it's best to announce the news as soon as possible.",
  ["1001041001_28"]="Truth doesn't inspire fear. Concealment does.",
  ["1001041001_29"]="Sorry for interrupting, Qing.",
  ["1001041001_3"]="Now, let's give a quick update on the current situation here. How is the progress on isolating the water source?",
  ["1001041001_30"]="Zhantan just sent a message, and she has a lot to report. The situation involving the Tower of Babel and Eme-an doesn't sound promising.",
  ["1001041001_31"]="I see. Contact her now.",
  ["1001041001_32"]="Qing scans the hall and notices the absence of a familiar figure.",
  ["1001041001_33"]="By the way, where is Xin? Where did she go off to this time?",
  ["1001041001_34"]="Always stuck in meetings, meetings, and more meetings! Finally, I've managed to sneak out!",
  ["1001041001_35"]="Oh, hey, isn't this that old man's turf? I'll go and ask him for something tasty!",
  ["1001041001_36"]="And in return, I'll help him patrol the fields!",
  ["1001041001_4"]="The central agricultural system has stopped drawing water from the Grandeur River, and irrigation across the Fertile Plains has been suspended.",
  ["1001041001_5"]="The emergency cross-region water transfer project is underway, with all regions deploying their engineering forces under the command of the Central Region to support the project.",
  ["1001041001_6"]="However, the anomalies caused by the contaminated water haven't ceased yet.",
  ["1001041001_7"]="Crop growth remains halted, and drone monitoring reports indicate that the area affected by the anomaly continues to expand.",
  ["1001041001_8"]="This is hardly surprising, considering that all the underground water in the Jiangyin Region stems from the Grandeur River.",
  ["1001041001_9"]="If we don't intervene soon, it's likely that this problem will surpass the boundaries of the Jiangyin Region within a few weeks.",
  ["1001041002_1"]="Hah! Finally caught you, intruder! What were you sneaking around here for?",
  ["1001041002_10"]="Zero!",
  ["1001041002_11"]="The girl whose name I call freezes in place.",
  ["1001041002_12"]="Watch out!",
  ["1001041002_13"]="Stop it!",
  ["1001041002_14"]="Before Zero can react, the red-haired girl's lance has already whistled through the air towards Zero.",
  ["1001041002_15"]="Xin!",
  ["1001041002_16"]="Ah, it's you, old man.",
  ["1001041002_17"]="At that very moment, the tip of the spear halts mid-air. The girl named Xin manages to stop her momentum just in time.",
  ["1001041002_18"]="What are you doing? She's my guest!",
  ["1001041002_19"]="Although Nong Ji has not fully grasped the situation, he realizes that Zero is my missing companion and diffuses the conflict with a simple statement.",
  ["1001041002_2"]="...",
  ["1001041002_20"]="Wait, what?!",
  ["1001041002_21"]="Stop there, Zero.",
  ["1001041002_22"]="...",
  ["1001041002_23"]="Upon seeing Nong Ji and me, the two girls, resembling cats caught in a private fight, retract their sharp claws in unison.",
  ["1001041002_24"]="All the people who were originally facing off on the ridge return to the house.",
  ["1001041002_25"]="In silence, a dark figure appears under the shade of a nearby tree.",
  ["1001041002_26"]="Wushi's gaze remains enigmatic as he observes the house from a distance.",
  ["1001041002_27"]="After a while, he shakes his head, then vanishes like a phantom.",
  ["1001041002_3"]="Not in the mood to talk, huh? Looks like I'll have to use force then!",
  ["1001041002_4"]="Time passes quickly as Nong Ji and I engage in casual conversation. When I suddenly become aware of the time, a few rays of the rising sun have already seeped through the gaps in the curtains and into the house.",
  ["1001041002_5"]="At that moment, I hear a sudden commotion from outside.",
  ["1001041002_6"]="Instinctively, I think of the wild animals, but upon listening more closely, I realize that something does not match...",
  ["1001041002_7"]="Nong Ji stands up and walks out of his house.",
  ["1001041002_8"]="Not far away, two figures are standing on the ridge, facing each other under the morning sun.",
  ["1001041002_9"]="One of them appears unfamiliar to me, but the other one is...",
  ["1001041101_1"]="The Granary of the Nation",
  ["1001041101_10"]="Zero remains composed with her eyes closed, showing no reaction.",
  ["1001041101_11"]="Obviously, the red-haired girl feels reluctant to apologize.",
  ["1001041101_12"]="Seriously, it's all because of you, old man. The government issued a city-wide evacuation notice, but you just refuse to leave. If I hadn't been worried about you, I wouldn't have come here every day and ended up causing this commotion.",
  ["1001041101_13"]="She hands her empty bowl to Nong Ji.",
  ["1001041101_14"]="Nong Ji takes it and gives her another large bowl of rice.",
  ["1001041101_15"]="Worried about me? You come here for free meals, little girl.",
  ["1001041101_16"]="Well, that's one of the reasons, too. I just can't resist your tasty dishes.",
  ["1001041101_17"]="Then she turns around, giving Zero and me a sharp look.",
  ["1001041101_18"]="But seriously, old man, you really need to be more careful and not invite suspicious people into your home.",
  ["1001041101_19"]="Just then, something in Xin's pocket starts ringing.",
  ["1001041101_2"]="Inside Nong Ji's house.",
  ["1001041101_20"]="Xin frowns and takes it out. It is a communicator.",
  ["1001041101_21"]="Huh? Qing?",
  ["1001041101_22"]="Despite her reluctance, Xin answers the call.",
  ["1001041101_23"]="Hello? Yeah, I'm investigating outside... Yeah, right. I'm in the agricultural district.",
  ["1001041101_24"]="Huh? Look for someone? Why do I have to run errands again? Alright, fine, just stop nagging and tell me about them...",
  ["1001041101_25"]="One of them has silver-gray hair and golden eyes, and she's about eighteen years old, right? Can you describe her clothes?",
  ["1001041101_26"]="...",
  ["1001041101_27"]="Excuse me?",
  ["1001041101_28"]="...",
  ["1001041101_29"]="Zero opens her eyes, staring at Xin in silence.",
  ["1001041101_3"]="Hey, that's not my problem! Who would sneak around someone's house in the middle of the night? I thought it was some kind of thief...",
  ["1001041101_30"]="Unaware, Xin continues taking notes, apparently not realizing that the person sitting across from her perfectly matches the description on the communicator.",
  ["1001041101_31"]="So, she wears a black cloak and a white dress... with a book hanging at her side? And a cosmos flower pendant near her ear? Gosh... I just can't imagine anyone dressing so strangely.",
  ["1001041101_32"]="Xin rolls her eyes as she speaks at the person on the other end of the communicator.",
  ["1001041101_33"]="Until her gaze lands on Zero.",
  ["1001041101_34"]="The air freezes for several seconds as I witness Xin's vivid expression change from confusion to realization and finally settle on astonishment.",
  ["1001041101_35"]="What?",
  ["1001041101_36"]="The red-haired girl, finally realizing the truth, slams the table and points at Zero's face, shouting:",
  ["1001041101_37"]="It's you?!",
  ["1001041101_4"]="The red-haired girl grumbles while digging into her rice bowl.",
  ["1001041101_5"]="Zero and I sit at the other end of the table, struggling to find our appetites.",
  ["1001041101_6"]="We are still catching our breath from that life-threatening experience.",
  ["1001041101_7"]="Meanwhile, one of the culprits seems unfazed, casually eating and drinking after entering into the room.",
  ["1001041101_8"]="Behave yourself, Xin. You accidentally harmed her, so you should apologize.",
  ["1001041101_9"]="Harmed her? But there's no harm done, right? Can't you see she's alive and kicking... Hey, tell me, did I harm you?",
  ["1001041201_1"]="WeiShi",
  ["1001041201_10"]="This sense of discord stems from the cerulean \"rust\" that has corroded the walls and floors as well as the quarantine area that separates the city from the outside world.",
  ["1001041201_11"]="Xin, who has been leading the way, suddenly turns around and walks towards us.",
  ["1001041201_12"]="Hey, you're the refugees from Ema-me... Emi-na... or whatever, right?",
  ["1001041201_13"]="Refugees?",
  ["1001041201_14"]="I wouldn't use the term \"refugee.\"",
  ["1001041201_15"]="No, YOU are a refugee!",
  ["1001041201_16"]="Yeah, aren't you?",
  ["1001041201_17"]="What's the big deal about a word? I can't stand people like you who get hung up on \"words\"... Why obsess over such pointless details? As long as we understand each other, it's all good, right?",
  ["1001041201_18"]="Huh? How did you know I'm a refugee?",
  ["1001041201_19"]="Xin's stare turns aggressive.",
  ["1001041201_2"]="The sun has fully risen, dispersing the thick vapor. We bid farewell to Nong Ji.",
  ["1001041201_20"]="Never mind. It doesn't matter. But let me warn you, don't bad-mouth me in front of Qing.",
  ["1001041201_21"]="I'll explain later. Just follow me. I'll take you both back.",
  ["1001041201_22"]="Are members of WeiShi allowed to appear in public media?",
  ["1001041201_23"]="That is Qing?",
  ["1001041201_24"]="Well, the lady you just saw is Qing.",
  ["1001041201_25"]="She gestures towards the direction where the projection was displayed.",
  ["1001041201_26"]="Xin shifts her gaze, making it difficult to discern her mood.",
  ["1001041201_27"]="The broadcast concludes, and one after another, the holographic projections across the city fade away.",
  ["1001041201_28"]="The young man bows deeply.",
  ["1001041201_29"]="Once again, I extend my sincere apologies to the people of CangLin City, particularly the farmers and producers. We remain steadfast in our commitment to identifying the source of the Cerulean Blight and discovering a cure.",
  ["1001041201_3"]="Apparently, Nong Ji is an ordinary person, and there are certain things that are not intended for him to hear.",
  ["1001041201_30"]="Last but not least, it is worth noting that all infected crops are still alive, and if we can promptly find a cure for the Cerulean Blight, we may still salvage a portion of the crops.",
  ["1001041201_31"]="Our grain reserves are ample enough to sustain us for more than two years, even without a harvest, so there is no need to panic.",
  ["1001041201_32"]="Fourthly, to address this situation, the Wellbeing Office has issued directives to coordinate the mobilization of Qian's grain reserves, and CangLin City has been granted permission to utilize its reserve granaries.",
  ["1001041201_33"]="Thirdly, given that the majority of crops are primarily consumed for their seeds and fruits, this plague will lead to a significant decline in agricultural production this year. In other words, the situation is dire.",
  ["1001041201_34"]="Secondly, while the Cerulean Blight does not prove fatal to plants, it induces sterility, rendering the affected crops incapable of producing seeds and fruits.",
  ["1001041201_35"]="Firstly, the Cerulean Blight significantly affects plants and can spread across various crop species, with affected crops exhibiting symptoms similar to those observed in animals.",
  ["1001041201_36"]="Since many of you are concerned about the implications of the Cerulean Blight on this year's agricultural production, I would like to provide a brief update on behalf of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture.",
  ["1001041201_37"]="At this moment, we are collaborating with other departments to investigate the origins of the Cerulean Blight. I assure you that we are committed to swiftly developing a treatment plan.",
  ["1001041201_38"]="Firstly, I extend my sincere apologies to everyone for the impact that the Cerulean Blight has had on our agricultural production and daily lives. The Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture assumes full responsibility for this predicament.",
  ["1001041201_39"]="Esteemed residents of CangLin City, I am Feng Lin, the Director of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture.",
  ["1001041201_4"]="Zero and I never imagine that the composed Zhantan and the impulsive girl in front of us actually belong to the same organization.",
  ["1001041201_40"]="In contrast to the female representative's assertiveness, the new representative exudes a warm and gentle demeanor.",
  ["1001041201_41"]="Shortly after, a male holographic figure emerges.",
  ["1001041201_42"]="The female representative offers a slight bow towards the camera before her holographic image fades away.",
  ["1001041201_43"]="Thank you for your attention, understanding, and support. We will exert every effort to address the Cerulean Blight swiftly and restore normalcy to the lives of all residents as soon as possible.",
  ["1001041201_44"]="6. Animal contamination has led to a loss of control over their behavior. To ensure everyone's safety, a curfew will be enforced in CangLin City starting at seven o'clock in the evening. Please stay in your homes and do not go outside.",
  ["1001041201_45"]="5. We have established restricted areas spanning a width of 1.5 kilometers on both sides of the Grandeur River. Until further notice, swimming, drawing water, and fishing in the river are strictly prohibited. All cross-river traffic has been temporarily suspended.",
  ["1001041201_46"]="4. At present, the Grandeur River is suspected to be the primary source of infection. Water extraction from the river has ceased, and arrangements have been made to import clean water to ensure a continued water supply.",
  ["1001041201_47"]="3. Residents under quarantine should adhere to the guidance provided by medical professionals and refrain from succumbing to panic.",
  ["1001041201_48"]="2. If you experience any discomfort, please promptly visit the nearest medical facility for examination.",
  ["1001041201_49"]="1. This disease is currently referred to as the Cerulean Blight. Its primary symptoms include an abnormal cerulean discoloration resembling metal on the skin, slower reaction times, and loss of appetite. Please assess yourself and those around you for any manifestation of these symptoms.",
  ["1001041201_5"]="That is, WeiShi.",
  ["1001041201_50"]="Dear residents of CangLin City, I am Ji Lanqing, the Zhi Jing of the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity. Given the recent outbreak of an unidentified disease, a state of emergency has been declared in CangLin City. I kindly request your understanding and compliance with the following guidelines.",
  ["1001041201_51"]="The holographic image of a young, composed, and majestic woman appears all over the city.",
  ["1001041201_52"]="As I wonder about the \"Qing\" that she keeps mentioning, a clear and soothing voice resonates throughout the city, reaching every corner.",
  ["1001041201_6"]="After a while, the outline of a city gradually comes into view.",
  ["1001041201_7"]="Compared to a city, CangLin City resembles more of a garden nestled amidst the Fertile Plains. Human settlements blend harmoniously with the natural surroundings, creating a picturesque landscape reminiscent of a traditional ink painting.",
  ["1001041201_8"]="Verdant, serene, and peaceful, it shimmers under the sunlight, akin to the most melodious part of a song.",
  ["1001041201_9"]="However, there is a subtle sense of discord, as if an inexplicable ink blot has marred a carefully composed painting or an incorrect note has intruded upon a harmonious refrain.",
  ["1001041202_1"]="Phew... finally.",
  ["1001041202_2"]="Coming into view is a doorway resembling an ink painting.",
  ["1001041202_3"]="The gracefully ascending eaves of the roof resemble distant mountains depicted in artwork. The beams and arches extend outward in a natural manner, reminiscent of the horizon at the edge of those far-off mountains.",
  ["1001041202_4"]="In contrast to the Tower of Babel's majestic grandeur, the entrance of WeiShi exudes a more intimate aura, resembling a warm embrace rather than a condescending glance from above.",
  ["1001041202_5"]="The turpentine-like glow emanating from within seems to beckon visitors inside. However, the doorway, shrouded in a dark verdant inkiness, does not reveal the specific intent behind the invitation.",
  ["1001041202_6"]="Is it scrutiny? Curiosity? Contemplation? Or perhaps it is none of the above?",
  ["1001041202_7"]="WeiShi.",
  ["1001041202_8"]="What exactly is the ancient secret organization in Qian like, one that has existed for thousands of years?",
  ["1001041202_9"]="After organizing my thoughts, I follow Xin and enter through the main gate.",
  ["1001041301_1"]="Secretary Qing",
  ["1001041301_10"]="Although those words are somewhat hollow because, as you have witnessed, we are currently preoccupied.",
  ["1001041301_100"]="She closes her eyes and speaks again, as if she has made up her mind about something.",
  ["1001041301_101"]="Let's leave this place.",
  ["1001041301_102"]="Huh?",
  ["1001041301_103"]="I'll escort you out of here. You can become an ordinary person again, free from all these matters.",
  ["1001041301_104"]="Hold on...",
  ["1001041301_105"]="For the first time, Zero interrupts me with unwavering determination.",
  ["1001041301_106"]="Someone has tampered with your consciousness.",
  ["1001041301_107"]="They've twisted your mind so you won't question why you ended up in the Tower of Babel or why you became the Head Librarian of Eme-an. Those questions have become blind spots in your memory, and you won't resolve them.",
  ["1001041301_108"]="You didn't choose this responsibility on your own.",
  ["1001041301_109"]="...",
  ["1001041301_11"]="I apologize if there has been any lack of courtesy.",
  ["1001041301_110"]="I'll find a way to break you free from this hypnosis.",
  ["1001041301_111"]="Until then, you can decide whether to leave this world or not.",
  ["1001041301_112"]="Is it because you don't like me?",
  ["1001041301_113"]="Is it because you don't want me to be the Head Librarian?",
  ["1001041301_114"]="Is it because you don't think I'm good enough?",
  ["1001041301_115"]="Not at all. Moreover, it has nothing to do with my thoughts.",
  ["1001041301_116"]="Oh, glad to hear that.",
  ["1001041301_117"]="I'm hereby rejecting your request.",
  ["1001041301_118"]="...",
  ["1001041301_119"]="I catch a hint of uncertainty in her eyes.",
  ["1001041301_12"]="I am Qing, a member of WeiShi and the Zhi Jing of the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity in this city.",
  ["1001041301_120"]="At that moment, I realize that I am not the only one who has been feeling uneasy.",
  ["1001041301_121"]="Anyway, we are now bound together.",
  ["1001041301_122"]="I raise the pendant in my hand towards her.",
  ["1001041301_123"]="I'm the Head Librarian of Eme-an.",
  ["1001041301_124"]="Your task is to protect the Tower of Babel.",
  ["1001041301_125"]="And to protect its Head Librarian, which is me.",
  ["1001041301_126"]="Since the Library of Babel is gone, your only task now is to protect me.",
  ["1001041301_127"]="...",
  ["1001041301_128"]="Zero looks at me in silence.",
  ["1001041301_129"]="After a long pause, she nods.",
  ["1001041301_13"]="Currently, CangLin City, WeiShi, and all of Qian are exerting their best efforts to address the food crisis caused by the Cerulean Blight.",
  ["1001041301_130"]="Understood.",
  ["1001041301_131"]="Let's figure out a solution together.",
  ["1001041301_132"]="We will find a way to rescue everyone stuck within the Library of Babel.",
  ["1001041301_133"]="Until then, WeiShi, which has extended a helping hand to us, will be an invaluable ally.",
  ["1001041301_14"]="However, as a member of C.A.V.E., we are obligated to assist Eme-an.",
  ["1001041301_15"]="This obligation is especially significant with the personal arrival of the Head Librarian of the Library of Babel.",
  ["1001041301_16"]="There seems to be a subtle change in the way Qing looks at me.",
  ["1001041301_17"]="You appear travel-weary. You must have undergone challenges on the way.",
  ["1001041301_18"]="While Zhantan briefed me, I still have many questions. I understand that now is not the ideal time to ask unsettling questions.",
  ["1001041301_19"]="Nevertheless, these questions are necessary because unsettling facts do not disappear simply because people ignore them.",
  ["1001041301_2"]="Upon stepping into the hall, my previously uneasy heart suddenly calms, like a ship moored in a windless harbor.",
  ["1001041301_20"]="Such is my style... and the style of WeiShi.",
  ["1001041301_21"]="Now, Head Librarian of Eme-an and the Library of Babel...",
  ["1001041301_22"]="On behalf of WeiShi, I request that Eme-an explains what happened at the Tower of Babel, the headquarters of C.A.V.E.",
  ["1001041301_23"]="What happened to Eme-an? What resources and personnel do you have remaining? Does C.A.V.E. still maintain its minimal structure? Will our alliance continue to exist?",
  ["1001041301_24"]="There is no need for haste. I have allocated ample time exclusively for our meeting, ensuring that our conversation remains undisclosed to the surface world. Every corner of this place has been secured to maintain utmost privacy.",
  ["1001041301_25"]="Please take your time and share the truth with me. In this critical moment, it is important that we maintain open and transparent communication.",
  ["1001041301_26"]="Well, it's a long story, to be honest...",
  ["1001041301_27"]="This is indeed surprising. Nemesis was behind the incident.",
  ["1001041301_28"]="What astonishes me even more is that the betrayer comes from Eme-an itself.",
  ["1001041301_29"]="With all due respect, such a grave error should never have occurred within the most ancient organization.",
  ["1001041301_3"]="The hall is adorned with pools on both sides, featuring lotus plants. Drops of water roll down the lotus leaves, creating ripples that slowly blend into the seemingly endless vapor of water.",
  ["1001041301_30"]="As the Head Librarian of Eme-an, you bear the responsibility for this unfortunate event.",
  ["1001041301_31"]="This is indeed surprising. Nemesis was behind the incident.",
  ["1001041301_32"]="What do you mean by that?",
  ["1001041301_33"]="You think I'm responsible for this?",
  ["1001041301_34"]="I understand that you have recently assumed the role of the Head Librarian. However, according to your account, you willingly entered the Tower of Babel.",
  ["1001041301_35"]="The Eme-ans presented you with an opportunity to turn back and return to a normal life, yet you chose to stay there.",
  ["1001041301_36"]="Therefore, you must assume the name \"Eme-an\" along with all the associated responsibilities.",
  ["1001041301_37"]="WeiShi, along with all the members of C.A.V.E., will not show leniency or grant you preferential treatment merely because you are a newcomer.",
  ["1001041301_38"]="Since you stand here, it is expected that you possess the qualifications and mindset required to engage with your allies.",
  ["1001041301_39"]="Otherwise, I regretably foresee the impending dissolution of C.A.V.E.",
  ["1001041301_4"]="Vague bamboo shadows can be seen behind elegant curtains and screens, exuding a classic flavor.",
  ["1001041301_40"]="At some point, Zero silently approaches my side. Her gaze is foreboding, reminiscent of the calm before a storm.",
  ["1001041301_41"]="I stop her.",
  ["1001041301_42"]="Secretary Qing",
  ["1001041301_43"]="Huh?",
  ["1001041301_44"]="With all due respect, while we were dealing with the anomaly...",
  ["1001041301_45"]="We managed to confine its impact within the Library.",
  ["1001041301_46"]="On the other hand, it appears that you allowed it to spread among the general public.",
  ["1001041301_47"]="Would you consider this a commendable approach?",
  ["1001041301_48"]="...",
  ["1001041301_49"]="Qing adjusts her glasses.",
  ["1001041301_5"]="Suspended in the air at the end of the corridor is a complex armillary sphere, depicting an enigmatic representation of the stars.",
  ["1001041301_50"]="Heh, you certainly possess a sharp tongue.",
  ["1001041301_51"]="We're both in the midst of this crisis.",
  ["1001041301_52"]="I believe that cooperation is the key to its resolution.",
  ["1001041301_53"]="Rather than blaming each other, we should unite as one.",
  ["1001041301_54"]="I believe that we both realize the urgency of the situation now.",
  ["1001041301_55"]="We must get to the bottom of the anomaly occurring in Qian.",
  ["1001041301_56"]="Only by doing so can we prevent a recurrence of Eme-an's fate.",
  ["1001041301_57"]="Qing's eyes remains concealed behind the reflection on her lenses.",
  ["1001041301_58"]="However, I sense a sudden shift in her demeanor.",
  ["1001041301_59"]="The sharpness that emanated from her dissipates.",
  ["1001041301_6"]="Beneath the stars stands an imposing figure dressed in cerulean blue.",
  ["1001041301_60"]="As she raises her gaze once more, a gentle smile graces her lips, and her expression softens considerably.",
  ["1001041301_61"]="I'm now convinced that the new Head Librarian of Eme-an is truly deserving of this title. You possess the qualifications to engage in an equitable dialogue with WeiShi.",
  ["1001041301_62"]="You were testing me.",
  ["1001041301_63"]="I don't like being tested.",
  ["1001041301_64"]="I apologize if I was too stern, but how can one rectify others if she herself is too afraid to confront the truth?",
  ["1001041301_65"]="We're your allies, and when it comes to Nemesis, we stand on the same side.",
  ["1001041301_66"]="Well, let's get back to business.",
  ["1001041301_67"]="Something seems amiss to me, and I suspect that Nemesis desires more than just an ancient sun. Moreover, I believe Eme-an is not the only organization they will stop at nothing to eliminate.",
  ["1001041301_68"]="The timing of the attack on Eme-an and the sudden crisis in Qian can't be mere coincidence. There must be a connection.",
  ["1001041301_69"]="While I will need to provide a comprehensive report to Master Yuanquan later, for now, please be assured that WeiShi is prepared to offer all the assistance it can to Eme-an.",
  ["1001041301_7"]="We have seen this figure before through the holographic projection.",
  ["1001041301_70"]="Since the Tower of Babel has been destroyed, I presume that you do not have a suitable place to stay.",
  ["1001041301_71"]="If you don't mind, please stay in this city for the time being, and I'll assist you in making the necessary arrangements at the government.",
  ["1001041301_72"]="Thank you.",
  ["1001041301_73"]="You're welcome.",
  ["1001041301_74"]="However, our primary focus remains on resolving the crisis in Qian, and other matters will have to wait until the crisis is lifted.",
  ["1001041301_75"]="It's regrettable that we can't fulfill our hosting duties while we have friends from afar.",
  ["1001041301_76"]="We eagerly anticipate your cooperation during your stay in CangLin City. This matter concerns all of Qian, and WeiShi is currently stretched thin in terms of manpower.",
  ["1001041301_77"]="Help is always welcome.",
  ["1001041301_78"]="We're glad to help.",
  ["1001041301_79"]="We'll do whatever we can.",
  ["1001041301_8"]="The stress brought by the holographic figure pales in comparison to the stress of this real encounter. As the cerulean figure turns around and fixes her gaze on us, even Xin stops bouncing and stands aside silently with her arms wrapped around herself.",
  ["1001041301_80"]="Thank you. By the way, there is one more thing.",
  ["1001041301_81"]="I understand this is an internal matter for Eme-an, and it may be inappropriate for me to inquire, but given the situation...",
  ["1001041301_82"]="Could you tell me the whereabouts of Master Cosmos, the former Head Librarian of Eme-an?",
  ["1001041301_83"]="I'd like to know the answer, too.",
  ["1001041301_84"]="Well, that's to be expected.",
  ["1001041301_85"]="The leader of the knowledgeable always maintains an air of mystery.",
  ["1001041301_86"]="Speculating about the unknowable is futile. Let's focus on the matters at hand.",
  ["1001041301_87"]="Qing turns her head and gazes out the window, observing the nearby streets and the distant fields, still adorned in lush greenery.",
  ["1001041301_88"]="Not a single trace of golden hues can be seen.",
  ["1001041301_89"]="Autumn is approaching...",
  ["1001041301_9"]="Welcome to CangLin City, representatives of Eme-an...",
  ["1001041301_90"]="Qing mutters to herself.",
  ["1001041301_91"]="The bountiful summer... when prolonged, it turns bitter.",
  ["1001041301_92"]="I walk into the lounge arranged by WeiShi.",
  ["1001041301_93"]="I relax my shoulders and exhale slowly, releasing the tension that has been holding me upright.",
  ["1001041301_94"]="That was nerve-wracking...",
  ["1001041301_95"]="Despite Qing's young age, her words cut like a knife. Her piercing stare sees everything, leaving no room for secrets.",
  ["1001041301_96"]="Did she scare you?",
  ["1001041301_97"]="Well, not that much.",
  ["1001041301_98"]="Yeah, she's downright terrifying.",
  ["1001041301_99"]="...",
  ["1001041401_1"]="The Cerulean Blight",
  ["1001041401_10"]="It's nothing too complicated. We've been conducting regular patrols in the city and checking on the citizens.",
  ["1001041401_11"]="I'd like you to join the patrols as well. Your unique perspective might offer valuable insights.",
  ["1001041401_12"]="Is it really okay for us to do so?",
  ["1001041401_13"]="I was under the impression that those dealing with anomalies should remain hidden from mundane society.",
  ["1001041401_14"]="They should never be involved with the surface world or be known to the public.",
  ["1001041401_15"]="Ordinary people are not meant to be aware of anomalies or our existence.",
  ["1001041401_16"]="The CangLin municipal government is responsible for governing CangLin City, while WeiShi is one of the secret organizations. However, Qing serves as both a director of the government and a member of WeiShi.",
  ["1001041401_17"]="Also, WeiShi members can interact with ordinary people, which was previously unknown to me.",
  ["1001041401_18"]="I see, that's why you're confused. I should have clarified earlier.",
  ["1001041401_19"]="I am both a member of WeiShi and the Zhi Jing of the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity. I serve as a link between the government and WeiShi, similar to how Zhantan acts as a bridge between Eme-an and WeiShi.",
  ["1001041401_2"]="The next day.",
  ["1001041401_20"]="We're not like Eme-ans who seclude themselves in their ivory tower, no longer involved with the surface world.",
  ["1001041401_21"]="WeiShi was initially established to oversee and benefit all the people of Qian, and as such, we maintain a healthy connection with the surface world.",
  ["1001041401_22"]="The <color=#fec66b>President</color> of Qian is aware of our existence, and our leader, Master Yuanquan, has pledged to lend his wisdom to the President of Qian when necessary.",
  ["1001041401_23"]="Of course, the general population remains unaware of the anomaly's existence. Currently, WeiShi presents itself as an official aid.",
  ["1001041401_24"]="Different lands have different people and customs.",
  ["1001041401_25"]="Just because we have formed an alliance doesn't mean we have to align our methods exactly. That should be obvious.",
  ["1001041401_26"]="As soon as Qing departs, Xin appears with an unhappy expression.",
  ["1001041401_27"]="Qing asked me to take you guys on patrol to help you understand the current situation in the city.",
  ["1001041401_28"]="Tsk, she keeps assigning me all these errands, and now she wants me to babysit two newbies.",
  ["1001041401_29"]="Suddenly, she throws something at me.",
  ["1001041401_3"]="When we return to the hall, Qing is already waiting for us in the center of the room.",
  ["1001041401_30"]="Just as the object is about to hit my forehead, Zero catches it.",
  ["1001041401_31"]="It is a pear.",
  ["1001041401_32"]="Xin looks away and waves her hand.",
  ["1001041401_33"]="Fill your belly before we hit the road. I don't want you passing out halfway there.",
  ["1001041401_4"]="It seems you had a peaceful rest last night",
  ["1001041401_5"]="Thank you for your hospitality.",
  ["1001041401_6"]="You're welcome. Actually, we could really use some assistance.",
  ["1001041401_7"]="I have some business to attend to at the government, and we're short-staffed. I was wondering if you could provide us with some help?",
  ["1001041401_8"]="What kind of help?",
  ["1001041401_9"]="Tell me more about it.",
  ["1001041402_1"]="As soon as we step into the hospital, we are taken aback by the crowd inside.",
  ["1001041402_10"]="Xin can't read the writing, it seems.",
  ["1001041402_11"]="With the help of a nurse, we quickly find a doctor who is taking a break.",
  ["1001041402_12"]="As it turns out, the doctor is a gynecologist.",
  ["1001041402_13"]="Just as we enter the consultation room, a pregnant woman rises from her seat.",
  ["1001041402_14"]="Zero suddenly realizes something and walks up to her.",
  ["1001041402_15"]="Is your surname Jiang?",
  ["1001041402_16"]="Oh, yes... have we met before?",
  ["1001041402_17"]="It is then that I notice the pregnant woman's name embroidered on her hospital gown.",
  ["1001041402_18"]="We're friends of Xin.",
  ["1001041402_19"]="Oh, wow! How amazing! You're her friends!",
  ["1001041402_2"]="People are scattered all around, and even the aisles are filled with patients awaiting treatment.",
  ["1001041402_20"]="Xin is a total lifesaver for our family. I've been wanting to properly thank her.",
  ["1001041402_21"]="She gently puts her hand on her belly, sporting the sweetest smile.",
  ["1001041402_22"]="If it weren't for her, my little one might have...",
  ["1001041402_23"]="Oh, I see you have important stuff to do. I'll leave you be for now.",
  ["1001041402_24"]="How can I help you?",
  ["1001041402_25"]="Oh, we're not patients.",
  ["1001041402_26"]="We're here on behalf of the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity.",
  ["1001041402_27"]="We'd like to learn about the situation here.",
  ["1001041402_28"]="Has anything unusual happened today?",
  ["1001041402_29"]="Well, let me put it this way...",
  ["1001041402_3"]="Nevertheless, the nurses manage to maintain order despite the overwhelming situation.",
  ["1001041402_30"]="The most unusual thing is the sudden influx of patients.",
  ["1001041402_31"]="What symptoms are those patients exhibiting?",
  ["1001041402_32"]="Loss of appetite and slowed metabolism, neurological reflexes, and movements.",
  ["1001041402_33"]="We're still searching for a cure.",
  ["1001041402_34"]="How many deaths have occurred so far?",
  ["1001041402_35"]="The doctor's expression becomes grave.",
  ["1001041402_36"]="As of now, there have been... no deaths.",
  ["1001041402_37"]="But isn't that a good thing?",
  ["1001041402_38"]="You don't seem relieved at all.",
  ["1001041402_39"]="I'm not talking about the people infected by the Cerulean Blight. I'm talking about the entire CangLin City.",
  ["1001041402_4"]="I'll go find a nurse and ask what's going on.",
  ["1001041402_40"]="Considering the population here, there should be three to four hundred natural deaths happening every day. Birth and death are part of the natural order in this world.",
  ["1001041402_41"]="However, ever since the Cerulean Blight spread, funeral parlors haven't received a single corpse... not a single one.",
  ["1001041402_42"]="Not only that, our obstetrics and gynecology department hasn't welcomed a newborn since then.",
  ["1001041402_43"]="It's as if the cycle of life and death here has been put on pause.",
  ["1001041402_44"]="That sounds similar to the contaminated crops.",
  ["1001041402_45"]="Well, I'm not sure about that. I'm not an agriculture expert, after all.",
  ["1001041402_46"]="...",
  ["1001041402_47"]="By the way, we are here to visit a patient.",
  ["1001041402_48"]="What's the patient's name?",
  ["1001041402_49"]="(Tell him the patient's name.)",
  ["1001041402_5"]="Without waiting for our response, Xin plunges into the crowd.",
  ["1001041402_50"]="Let me check the records... Oh, it's here. I'm sorry, but he's infected with the Cerulean Blight and can't have visitors now.",
  ["1001041402_51"]="I remember him. He broke his leg while working on the farm, right?",
  ["1001041402_52"]="Yeah, why does he need such a long treatment period for a simple leg injury?",
  ["1001041402_53"]="His injury is anything but \"simple.\"",
  ["1001041402_54"]="In fact, after contracting the Cerulean Blight, his leg muscles and bones underwent a significant increase in hardness and density. Our standard surgical instruments are ineffective in treating it, so we had to keep him hospitalized for observation.",
  ["1001041402_55"]="If it weren't for the bone misalignment hindering the healing process, the effects of the Cerulean Blight could even be considered... beneficial.",
  ["1001041402_56"]="Now, with the increased bone hardness, he can safely jump from a tree four or five meters tall without sustaining any injuries.",
  ["1001041402_57"]="No one experiences birth or death. All injuries and illnesses remain frozen at the moment of Cerulean Blight infection, without worsening or improving naturally.",
  ["1001041402_58"]="Seriously, what's going on here? How are we supposed to host the Harvest Festival with everything like this?",
  ["1001041402_59"]="If only the First Emperor could be reincarnated and solve this problem.",
  ["1001041402_6"]="Zero and I exchange glances, speechless.",
  ["1001041402_60"]="The First Emperor?",
  ["1001041402_61"]="Yes, Ji Xia, the First Emperor, the revered ancestor of agriculture among the Qian people. There are numerous legends surrounding him.",
  ["1001041402_62"]="However, now might not be the most suitable time to talk about legends...",
  ["1001041402_63"]="If you're interested, head to the <color=#fec66b>Central Square</color> where his statue is enshrined.",
  ["1001041402_64"]="Shall we go check the Central Square?",
  ["1001041402_65"]="Sure.",
  ["1001041402_66"]="But where is Xin?",
  ["1001041402_67"]="We lost track of her a while ago, and we have not been able to find her.",
  ["1001041402_68"]="With all the people in the hospital, it may take a while to locate her.",
  ["1001041402_69"]="Let's just go there and come back quickly.",
  ["1001041402_7"]="Because the counter right next to us bears two prominent words:",
  ["1001041402_70"]="Understood.",
  ["1001041402_71"]="Having made up our minds, we head back in the direction we came from.",
  ["1001041402_72"]="Not paying much attention to the road ahead, I accidentally bump into someone at the corner.",
  ["1001041402_73"]="Be careful.",
  ["1001041402_74"]="The man I bump into stands his ground and prevents me from falling.",
  ["1001041402_75"]="Are you alright? Wait, you are...",
  ["1001041402_76"]="I focus my eyes and realize it is someone I recognize.",
  ["1001041402_77"]="Wushi.",
  ["1001041402_78"]="Oh, it's you.",
  ["1001041402_79"]="I'm sorry, but I didn't find your friend that night. When I went back at dawn, Mr. Nong said you had already left.",
  ["1001041402_8"]="Information Desk.",
  ["1001041402_80"]="...",
  ["1001041402_81"]="But now it seems you've found your friend. Good to know that you're safe and sound.",
  ["1001041402_82"]="By the way, what brings you here to the hospital? Did someone get injured?",
  ["1001041402_83"]="No.",
  ["1001041402_84"]="We just came to take a look.",
  ["1001041402_85"]="A hospital isn't really a good place for sightseeing.",
  ["1001041402_86"]="You've heard their announcement, right? The Cerulean Blight is spreading, and the Bureau of Health & Welfare hasn't figured out how it spreads. You really should avoid going to crowded places like a hospital.",
  ["1001041402_87"]="What about you?",
  ["1001041402_88"]="Are you injured?",
  ["1001041402_89"]="Are you sick?",
  ["1001041402_9"]="Could it be that...?",
  ["1001041402_90"]="Obviously, he had not expected to be asked in return. He pauses before answering.",
  ["1001041402_91"]="No, it's my sister. She's weak and has been receiving treatment in the hospital, and I've come to visit her.",
  ["1001041402_92"]="At that point, he seems unwilling to continue the conversation. He shakes his head and prepares to leave.",
  ["1001041402_93"]="If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave for now.",
  ["1001041501_1"]="Brother and Sister",
  ["1001041501_10"]="Wushi places a toothpick on a slice of pear and offers it to Tiaohua.",
  ["1001041501_11"]="Yeah... I ran into a friend today, and she gave me these pears.",
  ["1001041501_12"]="A friend?",
  ["1001041501_13"]="Tiaohua's eyes light up.",
  ["1001041501_14"]="Yeah, it's the girl I've been telling you about. Turns out she's living here in CangLin City, too. Can you believe it? I never thought I'd get a chance to see her again.",
  ["1001041501_15"]="If it weren't for her taking care of me back then, I wouldn't have made it to see you again, brother. I've always wanted to properly thank her.",
  ["1001041501_16"]="So, did you thank her properly this time?",
  ["1001041501_17"]="Yeah, we had a long chat. She's doing great now, and she told me she's got an awesome job.",
  ["1001041501_18"]="I believe her because she had this warm glow in her eyes. She must have found herself a fantastic place.",
  ["1001041501_19"]="But she seemed busy with something important and had to leave. I wish I could have spent more time with her and introduced her to you.",
  ["1001041501_2"]="The hospital room is quiet and harbors the faint scent of pears.",
  ["1001041501_20"]="Don't worry. We'll meet her again someday.",
  ["1001041501_21"]="...",
  ["1001041501_22"]="You know what, brother? I used to think the world was huge and there were so many things I hadn't experienced.",
  ["1001041501_23"]="But suddenly, it feels like the world is small, and the things I let slip away will somehow find their way back to me.",
  ["1001041501_24"]="I... I have no regrets now.",
  ["1001041501_25"]="...",
  ["1001041501_26"]="How do you like the pear?",
  ["1001041501_27"]="Tiaohua turns her head away in response.",
  ["1001041501_28"]="Well, if there's anything to worry about, it's probably you, brother.",
  ["1001041501_29"]="...",
  ["1001041501_3"]="The occupant of the room is sitting in a wheelchair, leaning against the window and dozing off, unaware of the visitor's presence.",
  ["1001041501_30"]="You've been following Master. Is everything going well?",
  ["1001041501_31"]="...",
  ["1001041501_32"]="Lately, your gaze has been unsettling, and I'm really concerned.",
  ["1001041501_33"]="Don't force yourself to do things you don't want to. Master has a kind heart, and I'm sure he won't hold it against you.",
  ["1001041501_34"]="My decision has nothing to do with Master. He respects my choice.",
  ["1001041501_35"]="You're of the same type, always carrying the weight of the world for everyone else.",
  ["1001041501_36"]="I'm scared... brother...",
  ["1001041501_37"]="Suddenly, the girl gasps violently.",
  ["1001041501_38"]="Brother... *cough* *cough*",
  ["1001041501_39"]="Wushi pours water from the kettle he brought into a cup and holds it to the girl's lips. He pats her back while she sips.",
  ["1001041501_4"]="Wushi follows the scent and spots fresh pears on the bedside table, still glistening with water droplets.",
  ["1001041501_40"]="With the last drop of water gone, he wipes the droplets from the corners of Tiaohua's mouth and gently lays her back on the bed.",
  ["1001041501_41"]="As he straightens up, Tiaohua tugs at his clothes.",
  ["1001041501_42"]="Don't do anything risky or hurt yourself.",
  ["1001041501_43"]="Just seeing you again makes me so happy...",
  ["1001041501_44"]="Promise me... Promise me you'll take care of yourself. Promise me.",
  ["1001041501_45"]="Alright... I promise you.",
  ["1001041501_46"]="Soon after drinking the water, the weak girl grows tired and drifts into a deep sleep.",
  ["1001041501_47"]="Wushi tucks the blanket around her and steps out of the room.",
  ["1001041501_48"]="As he steps out of the room, his normally upright posture slumps.",
  ["1001041501_49"]="How's Tiaohua been lately?",
  ["1001041501_5"]="He approaches the table gently, picks up a pear, inspects it briefly, and begins to peel it with a fruit knife.",
  ["1001041501_50"]="...",
  ["1001041501_51"]="Not looking good. Despite all the treatment over the years, her condition hasn't improved even a bit.",
  ["1001041501_52"]="Master... please help me.",
  ["1001041501_53"]="While her condition isn't uncommon, there's no known cure for it. Not even I can change her fate.",
  ["1001041501_54"]="Wushi remains in a kneeling posture.",
  ["1001041501_55"]="Sower lets out a soft sigh.",
  ["1001041501_56"]="Well, take this water and give it to her.",
  ["1001041501_57"]="Thank you, Master.",
  ["1001041501_58"]="...",
  ["1001041501_59"]="Is there anything else?",
  ["1001041501_6"]="When the pear is nearly peeled, the girl in the wheelchair slowly opens her eyes.",
  ["1001041501_60"]="Yes, there's something else I need to report to you, Master.",
  ["1001041501_61"]="Please, go ahead.",
  ["1001041501_62"]="As you predicted, the survivors from Eme-an have arrived in Qian, including their leader and a young woman.",
  ["1001041501_63"]="I seek your guidance on how to deal with them.",
  ["1001041501_64"]="...",
  ["1001041501_65"]="So, those pieces are still in play.",
  ["1001041501_66"]="Nemesis didn't get their job done, it seems.",
  ["1001041501_67"]="To think that Magnifico made such a magnificent promise. Well, there is no use in complaining now.",
  ["1001041501_68"]="I hold no animosity towards Eme-an. In fact, I have a certain fondness for them.",
  ["1001041501_69"]="After all, I am a scholar myself and was once devoted to the pursuit of knowledge.",
  ["1001041501_7"]="Is that you, brother?",
  ["1001041501_70"]="However, those pieces belong neither to us nor to WeiShi.",
  ["1001041501_71"]="I don't quite understand, Master.",
  ["1001041501_72"]="We're playing a game of Go, and suddenly, chess king and a queen pieces appear on the board. What do you think we should do?",
  ["1001041501_73"]="Naturally, we should pause the game and remove the pieces that don't belong to our game.",
  ["1001041501_74"]="This is what must be done.",
  ["1001041501_75"]="It is not their fault; they simply appeared in the wrong place at the wrong time. And it is not our fault either; I cannot afford to underestimate WeiShi.",
  ["1001041501_76"]="Remove them from the board. As for the method, I leave it to your discretion, but ensure it's done swiftly.",
  ["1001041501_77"]="As you wish, Master.",
  ["1001041501_78"]="Is something else troubling you? You seem concerned.",
  ["1001041501_79"]="Worried about your sister, perhaps?",
  ["1001041501_8"]="She yawns and sits up in the wheelchair.",
  ["1001041501_80"]="Exactly, Master...",
  ["1001041501_81"]="Rest assured, Tiaohua will be fine.",
  ["1001041501_82"]="If I can fulfill my long-held wish, then not only Tiaohua, but all the people of Qian will be relieved from their suffering.",
  ["1001041501_83"]="I know I'm far from perfect, but I can confidently say that I have fulfilled most of my promises, except for those beyond my capabilities.",
  ["1001041501_84"]="Your promises are never empty, Master.",
  ["1001041501_85"]="Now, please allow me to take my leave.",
  ["1001041501_86"]="Wushi stands up, his eyes devoid of any hesitation.",
  ["1001041501_87"]="As he watches the path the two have taken, he has made up his mind.",
  ["1001041501_9"]="You seem happy. Did something good happen?",
  ["1001041601_1"]="Nongsang Pavilion",
  ["1001041601_10"]="I can't foresee what may happen to you outside of my sight.",
  ["1001041601_11"]="I won't leave your sight again.",
  ["1001041601_12"]="Hey, no need to be so tense.",
  ["1001041601_13"]="...",
  ["1001041601_14"]="...",
  ["1001041601_15"]="Let's go back before it gets dark.",
  ["1001041601_2"]="The vapor descends once again as Zero and I leave from the hospital.",
  ["1001041601_3"]="Although it is still early afternoon, the sun remains concealed behind thick clouds, enshrouding the entire city.",
  ["1001041601_4"]="Who was the man we just met earlier?",
  ["1001041601_5"]="Oh, he's the person I met on that night...",
  ["1001041601_6"]="I recount the events of that night to Zero.",
  ["1001041601_7"]="I see...",
  ["1001041601_8"]="You look a bit worried.",
  ["1001041601_9"]="It's nothing. I just hope that you'll always stay within my sight in the future.",
  ["1001041701_1"]="Ancestor of Agriculture",
  ["1001041701_10"]="I believe he is Feng Lin, the director of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture.",
  ["1001041701_11"]="Sensing my gaze, the young man turns his head, and our eyes meet.",
  ["1001041701_12"]="An expression of surprise flits across his face.",
  ["1001041701_13"]="Are you travelers from a distant land?",
  ["1001041701_14"]="Yeah.",
  ["1001041701_15"]="How did you figure that out?",
  ["1001041701_16"]="As I thought.",
  ["1001041701_17"]="The young lady over there is recognizable by her clothes.",
  ["1001041701_18"]="Are you Director Feng of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture?",
  ["1001041701_19"]="Indeed, you must have seen me through the holographic projection, I believe?",
  ["1001041701_2"]="By the time we reach our destination, the vapor has significantly dissipated.",
  ["1001041701_20"]="Normally, the Bureau of Culture & Tourism would be welcoming visitors. With the upcoming Harvest Festival next month, it would have been an ideal time for a warm welcome.",
  ["1001041701_21"]="However, due to the current situation, all publicity efforts have been suspended. I apologize for the unfortunate news I bring and any inconvenience caused.",
  ["1001041701_22"]="I assume you haven't had the chance to explore the city yet?",
  ["1001041701_23"]="While I may not be as knowledgeable as my colleagues in the Bureau of Culture & Tourism, I'm willing to provide you with any information that might interest you.",
  ["1001041701_24"]="I do have a question, actually.",
  ["1001041701_25"]="Oh? Please go ahead.",
  ["1001041701_26"]="Who's the man depicted in this statue?",
  ["1001041701_27"]="Ah, that's Ji Xia, the First Emperor of Qian.",
  ["1001041701_28"]="According to historical records, he unified the entire region of Qian. However, after the unification, he left the capital and embarked on a journey across the world.",
  ["1001041701_29"]="Legend has it that during his travels, he personally tested various herbs and educated his people about edible plants, medicinal herbs, and poisonous flora.",
  ["1001041701_3"]="In the center of the square stands a statue with a solemn and dignified expression, facing the river.",
  ["1001041701_30"]="He also introduced agricultural tools and techniques for cultivating fields and crops. As a result, the people of Qian revered him as the ancestor of agriculture.",
  ["1001041701_31"]="Moreover, the rituals honoring Ji Xia are a vital part of the Festival.",
  ["1001041701_32"]="Sounds like he was an extraordinary emperor.",
  ["1001041701_33"]="He certainly accomplished remarkable feats.",
  ["1001041701_34"]="Feng Lin pauses for a moment, then bursts into laughter.",
  ["1001041701_35"]="Hah, but that all happened thousands of years ago. Who can say for sure if the historical records are accurate or not?",
  ["1001041701_36"]="Perhaps he was simply an irresponsible conqueror who grew tired of ruling and decided to disappear for a while. Maybe the notion of him traveling the world was just an excuse to escape.",
  ["1001041701_37"]="As for all those achievements attributed to him, it's likely the result of later generations crediting him for the accomplishments of others.",
  ["1001041701_38"]="If Ji Xia were to know that he has become such a revered figure after thousands of years, he might burst into laughter.",
  ["1001041701_39"]="So, he was both an emperor and the god of agriculture?",
  ["1001041701_4"]="Judging by the attire depicted on the statue, it likely represents a significant figure from ancient Qian. Its placement in the square suggests its importance. However, I am unaware of the person it commemorates.",
  ["1001041701_40"]="God? No, no, that's far from the truth.",
  ["1001041701_41"]="The beliefs in Qian differ significantly from those in Japheth, Cyril, Obed, or any other civilization in the world.",
  ["1001041701_42"]="While other civilizations engage in rituals for the afterlife, we focus on our present life.",
  ["1001041701_43"]="While other civilizations worship ethereal gods, we venerate our ancestors.",
  ["1001041701_44"]="If there's anything truly noteworthy about Ji Xia, it is that he established what later became known as the \"nation.\"",
  ["1001041701_45"]="The distinction between the \"ancestor\" of agriculture and the \"god\" of agriculture is profound.",
  ["1001041701_46"]="The difference between a god providing a bountiful harvest and a mortal cultivating the land is substantial.",
  ["1001041701_47"]="Humans have their fate in their own hands. So, if one has to pay homage to someone, why don't they revere themselves? And if one seeks guidance from someone, why don't they look within themselves?",
  ["1001041701_48"]="In other civilizations, concepts like the end of the world, the last judgment, or something similar exist, with gods positioned at the culmination of everything.",
  ["1001041701_49"]="However, Ji Xia is not a god. He represents the origin of countless generations—a starting point and nothing more.",
  ["1001041701_5"]="What may be common knowledge to others often eludes me.",
  ["1001041701_50"]="We don't believe in gods or saints. We believe in ourselves and our ability to shape our own destiny.",
  ["1001041701_51"]="I see.",
  ["1001041701_52"]="Thank you for shedding light on this matter.",
  ["1001041701_53"]="But to be honest, I wish Ji Xia could wield some divine power and resolve the problem immediately...",
  ["1001041701_54"]="Heh, just kidding. It's up to us to tackle the challenges ourselves.",
  ["1001041701_55"]="By the way, do you know that the Harvest Festival will be held earlier?",
  ["1001041701_56"]="No, I haven't heard about it.",
  ["1001041701_57"]="When was it announced?",
  ["1001041701_58"]="Oh, when I left the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture, I had a feeling like I was forgetting something. Now I remember, I haven't shared the news yet...",
  ["1001041701_59"]="I made the decision fairly recently. Considering the current unrest in CangLin City, the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture decided to advance this year's Harvest Festival.",
  ["1001041701_6"]="How long will this situation continue?",
  ["1001041701_60"]="This time, the Festival won't be a celebration of a bountiful harvest, but rather an opportunity to pray for one and uplift everyone's spirits.",
  ["1001041701_61"]="We hope this festival will make foreign visitors feel welcome and at home.",
  ["1001041701_62"]="We'll definitely enjoy it.",
  ["1001041701_63"]="That would be fantastic.",
  ["1001041701_64"]="I've been to Obed before. Well, that was quite some time ago. The people there were so kind to me, and I've always wanted to repay their hospitality.",
  ["1001041701_65"]="And now, meeting you here feels like that line from the poet: \"A familiar visage in unfamiliar space, a long-awaited rain amidst drought's embrace.\" Well, not entirely accurate, since Qian isn't exactly unfamiliar to me.",
  ["1001041701_66"]="Anyway, I genuinely hope that Qian will leave you with unforgettable memories, just as Obed left a lasting impression on me.",
  ["1001041701_67"]="Feng Lin looks at the receding figures and then turns his attention to the solemn statue of Ji Xia.",
  ["1001041701_68"]="A familiar visage in unfamiliar space...",
  ["1001041701_69"]="But in the midst of this prolonged drought, will the long-awaited rain ever arrive?",
  ["1001041701_7"]="Out of the corner of my eye, I notice someone else gazing at the statue.",
  ["1001041701_8"]="Amidst this world of unfamiliar faces, I sense a faint familiarity in his.",
  ["1001041701_9"]="Oh, yes... he is the man who appeared in the live broadcast I watched upon entering the city.",
  ["1001041801_1"]="Ambush",
  ["1001041801_10"]="Everything is okay here. It's just lately we've started hearing strange noises in the middle of the night.",
  ["1001041801_11"]="What kind of noises?",
  ["1001041801_12"]="Oxen mooing, birds chirping... Hmm, I think I even heard a bear roaring last night.",
  ["1001041801_13"]="It sounded like the howling of a wild beast. Not like those oxen that wandered into the city, but more like...",
  ["1001041801_14"]="Like a bear... or a tiger... or some other wild animal...",
  ["1001041801_15"]="Seriously? A bear has broken into the city?",
  ["1001041801_16"]="Emerging from the vapor, a towering silhouette draws near.",
  ["1001041801_17"]="Just as it is about to step out of the vapor, a long spear descends from the sky like a thunderbolt, landing between us and the colossal creature.",
  ["1001041801_18"]="The spear pierces the ground, vibrating slightly. Shortly after, its owner descends from the sky and grips it firmly.",
  ["1001041801_19"]="Finally found you! I can't believe you ended up here and got yourself into such trouble!",
  ["1001041801_2"]="As I leave the square, the sun begins to set.",
  ["1001041801_20"]="Her vibrant fiery ponytail gracefully arcs through the air.",
  ["1001041801_21"]="Without turning around, she excitedly clutches her spear, aiming it at the fully revealed giant bear.",
  ["1001041801_22"]="Finally, things are starting to get interesting...",
  ["1001041801_23"]="For a moment, it is hard to tell who resembles a beast more—the bear or the girl.",
  ["1001041801_24"]="Let the fight begin! A fair duel between two hunters!",
  ["1001041801_3"]="The vapor silently envelops our surroundings.",
  ["1001041801_4"]="Maybe we should return to the square and wait for the vapor to clear.",
  ["1001041801_5"]="(Sound of a bear growling.)",
  ["1001041801_6"]="Wait, Zero...",
  ["1001041801_7"]="Did you hear that?",
  ["1001041801_8"]="...",
  ["1001041801_9"]="As the vapor thickens, the growls of the beast grow closer.",
  ["1001041802_1"]="The giant bear's body is almost entirely covered in bronze, and Xin's strikes barely leave scratches on it.",
  ["1001041802_10"]="Without turning around, Zero pulls out the daggers embedded in her shoulders and thighs, casually tossing them to the ground, near the ones she knocked down earlier.",
  ["1001041802_11"]="It is at that moment that I realize there were actually several daggers aimed at me.",
  ["1001041802_12"]="Each dagger was precisely targeted, and I was moments away from meeting my demise.",
  ["1001041802_13"]="Sensing the unusual sounds behind her, Xin momentarily freezes.",
  ["1001041802_14"]="Hey, what's happening on your side? Tsk!",
  ["1001041802_15"]="Just then, the giant bear's massive palm descends, forcing Xin to defend herself by holding her lance over her head to withstand the blow.",
  ["1001041802_16"]="Zero glances in the direction from which the daggers were shot, her voice so cold that the temperature around us seems to drop sharply.",
  ["1001041802_17"]="Show yourself.",
  ["1001041802_18"]="Vaguely, I catch a glimpse of a figure amidst the dense vapor.",
  ["1001041802_19"]="A strong sense of deja vu arises. I feel like I've witnessed a similar scene somewhere, sometime before!",
  ["1001041802_2"]="The battle between Xin and the bear reaches a stalemate. The bear's sharp claws fail to strike the swift Xin, and Xin's spear is unable to penetrate the bear's tough hide.",
  ["1001041802_20"]="Before a definitive answer forms, a long, piercing whistle interrupts my thoughts.",
  ["1001041802_21"]="Hmm? What the heck...?",
  ["1001041802_22"]="As if receiving a command, the giant bear releases Xin and turns around, retreating from the scene.",
  ["1001041802_23"]="And that mysterious figure, too, gradually dissipates into the vapor.",
  ["1001041802_24"]="Zero does not chase after the figure.",
  ["1001041802_25"]="Only after the figure has completely vanished does she, who had been standing in front of me like an unwavering guardian, feebly collapse to her knees.",
  ["1001041802_26"]="Take us back! Hurry!",
  ["1001041802_27"]="I hold Zero in my arms and tug at Xin, who is about to chase after the figure.",
  ["1001041802_28"]="...",
  ["1001041802_3"]="Perhaps I should take this opportunity to call for reinforcements?",
  ["1001041802_4"]="As that thought crosses my mind, a chilling sense of dread crawls up my spine, as if I am being watched by a snake while walking through grass.",
  ["1001041802_5"]="Instinctively, I turn around, only to find a black dagger flying towards me.",
  ["1001041802_6"]="Reflexively, I close my eyes and shield myself with my hands, trying to protect my vital areas.",
  ["1001041802_7"]="The sound of metal clashing and flesh being pierced occurs simultaneously, but the expected pain never follows.",
  ["1001041802_8"]="When I open my eyes, I see that familiar figure once again.",
  ["1001041802_9"]="Zero...",
  ["1001041901_1"]="The Eternal Summer",
  ["1001041901_10"]="And the various troubles that keep arising are becoming increasingly burdensome.",
  ["1001041901_11"]="You seem extraordinarily annoyed today.",
  ["1001041901_12"]="Did new problems arise?",
  ["1001041901_13"]="The Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture has unexpectedly proposed advancing the Harvest Festival to appease the populace.",
  ["1001041901_14"]="While I understand their reasoning, it's not wise to hold the Festival at a time like this, particularly with the escalating influence of the anomaly.",
  ["1001041901_15"]="However, given the growing unrest among the people, advancing the festival may alleviate the situation. Therefore, we have submitted the proposal to hold the Harvest Festival earlier today.",
  ["1001041901_16"]="Hmm? You don't seem surprised at all.",
  ["1001041901_17"]="Yeah, it's a long story...",
  ["1001041901_18"]="I see. So, you've run into Director Feng himself.",
  ["1001041901_19"]="The proposal was passed mostly because it was proposed by Director Feng himself.",
  ["1001041901_2"]="...report is over. That's what happened.",
  ["1001041901_20"]="The Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture is actually the most crucial division of the government. Feng Lin is indeed exceptional to have become the director at such a young age.",
  ["1001041901_21"]="Among all my colleagues, he's one of the most pragmatic and capable directors.",
  ["1001041901_22"]="He never drags his feet, never let his personal emotions cloud his judgment, and is easygoing in his everyday life, forging good relations with almost all departments.",
  ["1001041901_23"]="While he's principled in important matters, he has never offended anyone because of insisting on his own views. In fact, those who initially opposed him were eventually convinced by him in the end or even joined his side.",
  ["1001041901_24"]="Despite his young age, he is unexpectedly rich in experience, almost as if he has spent decades in the government.",
  ["1001041901_25"]="Moreover, he is well-versed with the actual production. As far as I can remember, he's never made any mistakes due to impractical ideas.",
  ["1001041901_26"]="Since it is he who made this proposal, I don't think anything will go awry.",
  ["1001041901_27"]="You seem to have something else to ask, perhaps?",
  ["1001041901_28"]="He mentioned Ji Xia...",
  ["1001041901_29"]="The legend about the First Emperor...",
  ["1001041901_3"]="Things are getting more complicated.",
  ["1001041901_30"]="Oh, you want to know why Ji Xia left the capital after unifying Qian?",
  ["1001041901_31"]="To be honest, this is one of the unsolved mysteries in Qian's history.",
  ["1001041901_32"]="There are a lot of historians, folklorists, and archaeologists who have researched this topic, and there are many different opinions.",
  ["1001041901_33"]="The legend Director Feng told you is the most mainstream theory, that the First Emperor wandered around Qian after he had unified the world, testing various herbs and imparting the essence of agriculture.",
  ["1001041901_34"]="However, there is also a less-popular version that says the First Emperor actually traveled around to seek immortality.",
  ["1001041901_35"]="According to some unofficial records, the First Emperor left the capital because he wanted to continue his rule for eternity.",
  ["1001041901_36"]="The so-called \"testing various herbs\" was just a by-product of his search for the elixir of immortality.",
  ["1001041901_37"]="As for imparting the essence of agriculture, it was because by teaching the people to farm, he no longer needed to search for food himself but would accept the people's offerings wherever he went.",
  ["1001041901_38"]="In that case, he was actually interested in satisfying his own selfish desires, and his people, hidden from truth, interpreted his actions as grace and worshiped him.",
  ["1001041901_39"]="That's a far cry from the mainstream theory.",
  ["1001041901_4"]="Considering everything, it's highly probable that the incidents in CangLin City and Fertile Plains were orchestrated by someone behind the scenes.",
  ["1001041901_40"]="No need to be so surprised. It was thousands of years ago after all, and it's normal for various theories to differ from one another.",
  ["1001041901_41"]="No one alive has ever seen Ji Xia with their own eyes. So, whether he was an exceptional or tyrannical emperor, we shouldn't be surprised.",
  ["1001041901_42"]="Or perhaps the actual truth doesn't align with any of those theories that have been passed down so far.",
  ["1001041901_43"]="Speaking of which, WeiShi was established at Ji Xia's era, and we have preserved a huge amount of historical records from that era.",
  ["1001041901_44"]="However, we have a peculiar rule that all records about Ji Xia himself are highly classified, and only Master Yuanquan is permitted to access them. The reason behind this rule remains a mystery.",
  ["1001041901_45"]="But unfortunately, Master Yuanquan is not here.",
  ["1001041901_46"]="Where has he gone?",
  ["1001041901_47"]="Master Yuanquan went to QingYu City before you arrived in CangLin City.",
  ["1001041901_48"]="QingYu City?",
  ["1001041901_49"]="I vaguely recall hearing that name from Zhantan.",
  ["1001041901_5"]="And mostly likely, the culprit now sees [BBNAME] as an unexpected threat that must be eliminated.",
  ["1001041901_50"]="QingYu City is situated on Mount Tianque in the upper reaches of the Grandeur River, where it converges with the Immense Mountain.",
  ["1001041901_51"]="Actually, QingYu City is the origin of this anomaly, and CangLin City is only affected because it's located downstream along the Grandeur River.",
  ["1001041901_52"]="Coincidentally, QingYu City is also the place where the First Emperor established the first capital of Qian. It served as the cradle of Qian's civilization.",
  ["1001041901_53"]="Countless bronze artifacts have been unearthed there, most of which are rare treasures of exquisite craftsmanship. Many of those artifacts are so remarkable that it's hard to imagine they were created thousands of years ago.",
  ["1001041901_54"]="Perhaps they are miracles bestowed by gods.",
  ["1001041901_55"]="An intriguing thought, but unfortunately, WeiShi doesn't believe in gods.",
  ["1001041901_56"]="Why seek answers from deities when we haven't actually understood the world around us? One day, humans will be able to understand the world on their own.",
  ["1001041901_57"]="Feng Lin once said something similar.",
  ["1001041901_58"]="Oh? Ha, that's hardly surprising. If I hadn't confirmed multiple times they he's indeed just an ordinary person, I would have recruited him into WeiShi.",
  ["1001041901_59"]="Zero, who has remained silent all this while, suddenly speaks up.",
  ["1001041901_6"]="But why?",
  ["1001041901_60"]="Zero's wounds have been attended to by the medical staff. She was terribly wounded during the ambush, but she insisted on staying by my side, seemingly impervious to pain.",
  ["1001041901_61"]="It feels as if she never needs to rest as long as her physiology is functioning.",
  ["1001041901_62"]="Bronze. Immortality. Eternal life. Ji Xia.",
  ["1001041901_63"]="Zero and I exchange a glance. At that moment, we both gain insight from each other's eyes.",
  ["1001041901_64"]="Gradually, an invisible web interweaves between these keywords.",
  ["1001041901_65"]="Secretary Qing",
  ["1001041901_66"]="Perhaps we were wrong from the beginning.",
  ["1001041901_67"]="Hmm? What do you mean?",
  ["1001041901_68"]="I mean, why would we define this infection as...",
  ["1001041901_69"]="A disease?",
  ["1001041901_7"]="I didn't mess with anyone.",
  ["1001041901_70"]="I cover my head as a crazy idea slowly takes shape in my mind.",
  ["1001041901_71"]="One by one, the information provided by everyone along the way starts replaying in my mind.",
  ["1001041901_72"]="However, ever since the Cerulean Blight spread, funeral parlors haven't received a single corpse... not a single one.",
  ["1001041901_73"]="Not only that, our obstetrics and gynecology department hasn't welcomed a newborn since then.",
  ["1001041901_74"]="It's as if the cycle of life and death here has been put on pause.",
  ["1001041901_75"]="However, there is also a less-popular version that says the First Emperor actually traveled around to seek immortality.",
  ["1001041901_76"]="The so-called \"testing various herbs\" was just a by-product of his search for the elixir of immortality.",
  ["1001041901_77"]="Finally, all the pieces of information interconnect, forming a comprehensive tapestry.",
  ["1001041901_78"]="Perhaps this is not a disease at all.",
  ["1001041901_79"]="At that moment, a WeiShi member hurriedly approaches.",
  ["1001041901_8"]="Indeed, it's puzzling why the culprit is targeting the Head Librarian of Eme-an rather than WeiShi, who holds greater influence and power.",
  ["1001041901_80"]="Qing! Sorry for interrupting!",
  ["1001041901_81"]="What do you mean?",
  ["1001041901_82"]="The Delphic Oracle has just sent us their water analysis results!",
  ["1001041901_83"]="The Delphi Academy's medical department conducted physiological experiments on the water samples and discovered that contaminated cells cease to divide anymore. Moreover, their original carbon-based structure rapidly transformed into an unknown compound.",
  ["1001041901_84"]="They are now conducting further analysis, but it seems that the new compound is a polymer formed from an unidentified element combined with metal elements.",
  ["1001041901_85"]="Simply put, the cells contaminated by the water transform from carbon-based life to a form of life with metallic properties.",
  ["1001041901_86"]="It appears that the transformed cells won't reproduce or evolve on their own. They will remain fixed in their current state as long as there is no negative external interference, possessing an almost unlimited lifespan.",
  ["1001041901_87"]="They concluded that the new life form lacks the potential for iterative growth and evolution but possesses an almost eternal lifespan.",
  ["1001041901_88"]="...",
  ["1001041901_89"]="The hall falls silent in an instant.",
  ["1001041901_9"]="However, we can only hope to find answers directly from the culprit themselves.",
  ["1001041901_90"]="Taking a deep breath, I slowly add the words I have not finished.",
  ["1001041901_91"]="It's not a disease.",
  ["1001041901_92"]="It's immortality.",
  ["1001041901_93"]="It is not a disease.",
  ["1001041901_94"]="It is immorality.",
  ["1001041901_95"]="With eternal life, there is no need for reproduction. Crops won't bear fruits, humans won't give birth to babies, and animals won't lay eggs or bear offspring.",
  ["1001041901_96"]="There is no death or new birth.",
  ["1001041901_97"]="Such is the eternal fruitless summer.",
  ["1001050101_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001050101_10"]="Sower tilts his head.",
  ["1001050101_11"]="Speaking of which, you treated me to a bowl of wine in the Western Region over a decade ago.",
  ["1001050101_12"]="You were young back then, but now you can drink with me. So, would you like a glass as well?",
  ["1001050101_13"]="Thank you, Master, but I've never had an appreciation of wine.",
  ["1001050101_14"]="Ha, I'll enjoy the wine on my own then.",
  ["1001050101_15"]="Sower takes a sip of wine and continues reciting poetry.",
  ["1001050101_16"]="Though the world's vastness eludes my sight. Time's toll on life shines clear and bright.",
  ["1001050101_17"]="In the feast of nature's bounty, bear's paw grants girth. While slender grace is found, in the frog's agile mirth. Where dwells the Divine Lord, in realms unknown? Does the Immortal One grace existence's throne?",
  ["1001050101_18"]="In the Eastern sky Ruomu's embrace, where the Zhulong resides with radiant grace.",
  ["1001050101_19"]="With blade's swift dance, I sever its limbs. Consume its flesh, quelling its whims. No more it soars beneath daylight's gleam. Nor hides in night's veil, a vanishing dream.",
  ["1001050101_2"]="Fleeting Life",
  ["1001050101_20"]="Old souls endure, death's grip they defy. Youth's tears withheld, their sorrows shy.",
  ["1001050101_21"]="This is a poem called \"Fleeting Days\" written by an ancient poet, I believe?",
  ["1001050101_22"]="Indeed. Do you understand the meaning of this poem?",
  ["1001050101_23"]="I'm not well-educated, so I can only try to interpret it literally.",
  ["1001050101_24"]="The poem reflects on the fleeting nature of time and the brevity of life. The poet laments and wonders if there truly exists a god who does not rely on grains for sustenance.",
  ["1001050101_25"]="Legend has it that there is a colossal tree named Ruomu in the eastern skies, beneath which rests Zhulong, a dragon that controls the cycle of day and night with its eyes opening and closing.",
  ["1001050101_26"]="So, the poet whimsically imagines that if he were to sever its feet and consume its flesh, time would come to a halt naturally.",
  ["1001050101_27"]="Thus, the old would never die, and the young would no longer weep over their deceased relatives.",
  ["1001050101_28"]="Yes, indeed.",
  ["1001050101_29"]="What a poem, what a dream! If everyone could enjoy eternal life, what kind of paradise would this world become?",
  ["1001050101_3"]="Thatched eaves hang low, and green grass grows by the stream.",
  ["1001050101_30"]="There would be no aging, no illness, and no death. Everyone would have ample time to know and befriend one another.",
  ["1001050101_31"]="All troubles and conflicts would diminish in the face of infinite longevity, leading to boundless knowledge, wisdom, and experience.",
  ["1001050101_32"]="In such a world, everyone could possess the wisdom of sages.",
  ["1001050101_33"]="It's truly a marvelous dream.",
  ["1001050101_34"]="However, in reality, there are neither immortal beings nor dragons, and it's impossible for mortals to attain immortality.",
  ["1001050101_35"]="Heh, because you've never seen immortal beings or dragons with your own eyes, you can so easily conclude that they don't exist?",
  ["1001050101_36"]="As for immortality, countless emperors have pursued it, so it may not be an entirely futile endeavor, right?",
  ["1001050101_37"]="Sower shakes his head and sighs.",
  ["1001050101_38"]="When everyone declares something beautiful, its concealed ugliness is exposed. When everyone recognizes something as good, its flaws become evident.",
  ["1001050101_39"]="Hence, existence arises from nothingness, adversity emerges from tranquility, magnitude finds definition in brevity, eminence seeks solace in humility, and melody arises amidst discord.",
  ["1001050101_4"]="The bright moon shines in the sky, resembling a gleaming mirror.",
  ["1001050101_40"]="Sages act purposelessly and impart wisdom with veiled words. All beings are permitted to flourish undisturbed, nurtured without appropriation, fostered without reliance on personal strength, and achievements attained without laying claim to merit.",
  ["1001050101_41"]="Your wisdom is far beyond my comprehension, Master.",
  ["1001050101_42"]="Ha, it's just some knowledge gathered from others. What I just said was passed down to me by a philosopher friend of mine.",
  ["1001050101_43"]="According to him, the world is driven by desires for profit, and it is precisely through contrasts that people develop desires, competing for fame and fortune.",
  ["1001050101_44"]="Therefore, if one does not boast of extraordinary talents, does not value what is cherished, and does not flaunt what arouses greed, then one will not disturb the souls of others.",
  ["1001050101_45"]="In other words, once all desires are eliminated, one's soul will always remain serene and calm.",
  ["1001050101_46"]="However, even sages find it difficult to eliminate the desires for two specific things.",
  ["1001050101_47"]="Satiety and vitality, that is.",
  ["1001050101_48"]="Well, isn't it a bit complicated? To put it simply, it's about being well-fed and healthy.",
  ["1001050101_49"]="These are the most fundamental needs for all living beings in the world, and all beings are equal in regards to these needs. Therefore...",
  ["1001050101_5"]="A person emerges from beneath the eaves, bathed in moonlight, and raises a glass of wine to the moon.",
  ["1001050101_50"]="A wise emperor's reign will grant their people a content mind, a nourished body, a weak desire, and a strong spirit. This helps people attain knowledge and eliminate desires.",
  ["1001050101_51"]="In other words, by satisfying people's hunger and strengthening their bodies, emperors can protect their people from greed and desires, fostering peace in the world.",
  ["1001050101_52"]="At that time, all lives will be like thriving flowers in a fertile wilderness, blooming towards the sun.",
  ["1001050101_53"]="...",
  ["1001050101_54"]="You have your own reasons for your actions, Master, and I'm not supposed to ask you questions, but...",
  ["1001050101_55"]="Feel free to ask.",
  ["1001050101_56"]="Please forgive my boldness. Seeing your excitement today, is your grand plan approaching its final stage?",
  ["1001050101_57"]="You're quite perceptive, Wushi.",
  ["1001050101_58"]="Yes, it's exactly as you said.",
  ["1001050101_59"]="Please forgive me for my incompetence. I failed to remove those unexpected visitors at this critical moment.",
  ["1001050101_6"]="O, fleeting time, in blissful sight. Let us partake in the wine, in view of moonlight.",
  ["1001050101_60"]="Well, there's no need to apologize.",
  ["1001050101_61"]="Sower looks down at Wushi, wearing a friendly expression.",
  ["1001050101_62"]="I have other matters to attend to, and we won't be seeing each other again in the near future. As for the remaining matters in CangLin City, I entrust them to you.",
  ["1001050101_63"]="The remaining matters?",
  ["1001050101_64"]="You have your own path, Wushi. Follow your heart, and everything will be fine.",
  ["1001050101_65"]="Wushi remains silent for a while before nodding slightly.",
  ["1001050101_66"]="As you wish, Master.",
  ["1001050101_67"]="Sower turns his gaze to his glass. The wine is almost gone.",
  ["1001050101_68"]="The time has come.",
  ["1001050101_69"]="It is time to break free from the cycle of life and death.",
  ["1001050101_7"]="A shadow appears by his side.",
  ["1001050101_70"]="It is time to establish an eternal paradise.",
  ["1001050101_8"]="You're in mood for drinking today, Master.",
  ["1001050101_9"]="It's a rare moment of relaxation in this eternal summer. Enjoying some homemade wine is a joy of a fleeting life.",
  ["1001050201_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001050201_10"]="What is the leader of the great minds in Eme-an pondering about?",
  ["1001050201_11"]="Please don't tease me.",
  ["1001050201_12"]="Heh, I'm not teasing you. If it weren't for your help, we would...",
  ["1001050201_13"]="You would still have discovered the truth.",
  ["1001050201_14"]="My colleagues often say that I'm too serious and lack a sense of humor, and now it seems that you're no different.",
  ["1001050201_15"]="Do you have any concerns? Although my knowledge isn't as profound as that of Master Yuanquan, I can try to help alleviate your worries.",
  ["1001050201_16"]="...",
  ["1001050201_17"]="Immortality doesn't sound bad at all.",
  ["1001050201_18"]="Indeed, everyone has to face death. The allure of immortality is undeniably strong.",
  ["1001050201_19"]="Should we truly eliminate the Cerulean Blight?",
  ["1001050201_2"]="Glimpse of the Future",
  ["1001050201_20"]="...",
  ["1001050201_21"]="Sometimes I find myself pondering that question as well. Maybe we should simply let nature take its course.",
  ["1001050201_22"]="Perhaps we are too narrow-minded in labeling it as the \"Cerulean Blight.\"",
  ["1001050201_23"]="Imagine this: if everyone could live for thousands of years, explore the world, forge countless friendships, delve into the masterpieces left by wise individuals, and witness the passage of time and the evolution of eras, it would truly be a remarkable existence.",
  ["1001050201_24"]="So, should we stop here?",
  ["1001050201_25"]="We're preventing people from achieving everlasting life.",
  ["1001050201_26"]="And that includes ourselves.",
  ["1001050201_27"]="Yeah, you're right.",
  ["1001050201_28"]="However, you heard their conclusion. All creatures infected by the Cerulean Blight will remain in their current state for eternity.",
  ["1001050201_29"]="Immortality would stop natural reproduction.",
  ["1001050201_3"]="One week later.",
  ["1001050201_30"]="If the Cerulean Blight continues to spread, it will stop the evolution of the entire biosphere, which has been progressing for billions of years.",
  ["1001050201_31"]="Biological theory suggests that life is a complex miracle resulting from countless coincidences and errors.",
  ["1001050201_32"]="While the stable replication of genes ensures the transmission of species, it is the accidental and diverse mutations that drive evolution.",
  ["1001050201_33"]="Even the origin of human \"intelligence\" may be attributed to a deoxyribonucleotide mistakenly copied in the brain of a primate millions of years ago.",
  ["1001050201_34"]="Allowing the Cerulean Blight to spread would mean eliminating the infinite possibilities for millions of species in the future.",
  ["1001050201_35"]="Such an outcome must never come to pass. As members of C.A.V.E., it is our duty to remain vigilant against anomalies.",
  ["1001050201_36"]="If we let our guard down, how can we fulfill our duty of protecting our peers in the surface world?",
  ["1001050201_37"]="I understand.",
  ["1001050201_38"]="By the way, the Cerulean Blight incident and the downfall of the Tower of Babel occurred almost simultaneously.",
  ["1001050201_39"]="Do you think Nemesis is somehow involved?",
  ["1001050201_4"]="The water in the pool, tinged with a green hue, can hardly reflect anything.",
  ["1001050201_40"]="To be honest, we have considered this possibility.",
  ["1001050201_41"]="Head Librarian, did Master Cosmos share any information about Nemesis with you?",
  ["1001050201_42"]="No, nothing at all.",
  ["1001050201_43"]="I see...",
  ["1001050201_44"]="They have practically disappeared in recent years, but we have some clues regarding their activities.",
  ["1001050201_45"]="As far as we know, their current size has reached an all-time low.",
  ["1001050201_46"]="However, at the same time, the barrier for entering this secretive group has been raised to an unprecedented level.",
  ["1001050201_47"]="We have no knowledge about the details of its members, aside from the fact that all of them are leaders in specific fields and are referred to as Apostles, each with a unique code name.",
  ["1001050201_48"]="Although it may sound self-aggrandizing, if even WeiShi can't uncover their true identities, those members must have attained positions beyond our reach.",
  ["1001050201_49"]="Therefore, it's entirely reasonable to suspect their involvement in the Cerulean Blight crisis. Their influence extends far enough to make this possible.",
  ["1001050201_5"]="It has been a week since we identified the source of this anomaly.",
  ["1001050201_50"]="Considering what you experienced before, this is likely the case, as no one within Qian should harbor any hostility towards you.",
  ["1001050201_51"]="It's very possible that an Apostle is lurking within Qian, concealed deeper than we can imagine.",
  ["1001050201_52"]="We must be careful.",
  ["1001050201_53"]="While your words hold truth, the challenge lies in determining what actions to take.",
  ["1001050201_54"]="Our enemy is lurking in the shadows, and guarding against a hidden threat is no easy task.",
  ["1001050201_55"]="Instead of wasting time speculating about their next move, we should focus on our own tasks.",
  ["1001050201_56"]="The fewer loopholes we have, the better our chances of catching them off guard and eventually turning the tables.",
  ["1001050201_57"]="...",
  ["1001050201_58"]="Why don't you go for a walk? Staying here won't get us anywhere.",
  ["1001050201_59"]="Are you suggesting we lure them out?",
  ["1001050201_6"]="However, even after we figure out its principles, the situation has not improved. We have heard nothing from QingYu City, and all we can do is wait in the city, watching it transform into bronze, day by day.",
  ["1001050201_60"]="What do you mean?",
  ["1001050201_61"]="Indeed. We will lure them out.",
  ["1001050201_62"]="For now, we can't go to QingYu City and address the root cause with Master Yuanquan.",
  ["1001050201_63"]="Even so, we can still do our best to resolve the crisis in CangLin City, including unraveling the identity of the mastermind behind these events.",
  ["1001050201_64"]="Moreover...",
  ["1001050201_65"]="By observing this city with your own eyes, you can find answers to many of your questions and doubts.",
  ["1001050201_66"]="Although you're a foreigner, somehow I have a feeling that you will develop an affinity for this place.",
  ["1001050201_67"]="And I believe that this land will always embrace you with open arms.",
  ["1001050201_7"]="Soon, CangLin City will be transformed into a city of bronze.",
  ["1001050201_8"]="There you are.",
  ["1001050201_9"]="I turn around and see Qing walking slowly towards me.",
  ["1001050202_10"]="My little one... it used to kick my belly all the time, but recently, it has become quiet, behaving so well that it makes me nervous.",
  ["1001050202_11"]="Lately, there have been all sorts of rumors... whether the crops are failing or there's a water shortage or if there's a disease outbreak. Everyone is on edge.",
  ["1001050202_12"]="Many people in CangLin City used to live in the Western Region, and everyone is afraid that what happened before will happen again.",
  ["1001050202_13"]="Sometimes, I can't help but wonder if my little one doesn't want to come into this world because it's worried about causing trouble for us.",
  ["1001050202_14"]="Not at all! How could it possibly cause trouble?",
  ["1001050202_15"]="Yeah, I agree. How could it possibly cause trouble? Lately, I've been dreaming about this baby, and I keep telling it...",
  ["1001050202_16"]="You won't cause any trouble to Mommy. I want to meet you soon, and I hope you'll grow up healthy.",
  ["1001050202_17"]="You'll become a healthy and kind person, just like Xin.",
  ["1001050202_18"]="Xin blushes and looks away awkwardly.",
  ["1001050202_19"]="She's praising you.",
  ["1001050202_2"]="After a busy morning, the road leading out of the city has finally been cleared for transportation vehicles.",
  ["1001050202_20"]="Sh-shut up...",
  ["1001050202_21"]="Suddenly, the pregnant woman's hand, which was caressing her abdomen, pauses.",
  ["1001050202_22"]="Hey, I think I just felt the baby kick again.",
  ["1001050202_23"]="It's responding to you.",
  ["1001050202_24"]="The pregnant woman chuckles, and the sorrow on her face dissipates.",
  ["1001050202_25"]="I hope this kid will grow up in a better world. Do you think it will?",
  ["1001050202_26"]="...",
  ["1001050202_27"]="Yes, it will.",
  ["1001050202_28"]="Well, my little one won't be able to see the Harvest Festival this year. I hope we can both participate in it next autumn.",
  ["1001050202_29"]="A gray-haired man dressed in black leans against a tree, observing from a distance a young person who helped a pregnant woman onto the bus.",
  ["1001050202_3"]="One by one, the patients leave the hospital.",
  ["1001050202_30"]="This will be my perfect opportunity, Wushi mutters.",
  ["1001050202_31"]="With everyone's attention focused on the young pregnant woman, if he throws his dagger now, he could easily slit the throat of the Head Librarian of Eme-an.",
  ["1001050202_32"]="However, something is hindering him.",
  ["1001050202_33"]="Why? The hilt of the dagger in his hand feels as if it were welded to his palm, refusing to fly away.",
  ["1001050202_34"]="His eyes remain fixed on the young pregnant woman, the loving smile on her face pricking his heart.",
  ["1001050202_35"]="Even when everyone leaves his sight, the dagger, its hilt damp with sweat, remains firmly held in his hand.",
  ["1001050202_4"]="In the crowd preparing to board the bus, a familiar figure waves at us.",
  ["1001050202_5"]="Hey, it's you guys... Oh, Xin! You're here, too!",
  ["1001050202_6"]="Huh? Are you leaving the city, Ms. Jiang?",
  ["1001050202_7"]="Yes, the hospital here is overcrowded, and I feel guilty occupying a bed.",
  ["1001050202_8"]="Besides, the government mentioned that the water of the Grandeur River is polluted, and I'm concerned it won't be good for the baby in my belly if I stay here any longer.",

  ["1001050301_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001050301_10"]="Hence, a handful of rice, after passing through the Western Path, would become as precious as a handful of gold.",
  ["1001050301_11"]="Since ordinary people couldn't afford such expensive rice, some of them had to toil diligently even on the barren land, hoping that a rice flower would bloom in the summer.",
  ["1001050301_12"]="His parents were farmers in this land.",
  ["1001050301_13"]="He was born in a fortunate year.",
  ["1001050301_14"]="At the time, his family still had enough food, and his arrival brought joy. A boy required only a small amount of food for three years before becoming the youngest laborer in the family.",
  ["1001050301_15"]="He had a sturdy physique, akin to weeds in a wheat field, thriving with minimal nourishment.",
  ["1001050301_16"]="By the time he was three years old, he walked barefoot on the ridge with his family's ox, collecting hogweed from the fields.",
  ["1001050301_17"]="At the age of six, he could lift the axe and split every piece of firewood he brought back.",
  ["1001050301_18"]="When he reached eight, he assisted his father in laying the foundation of a new house.",
  ["1001050301_19"]="The contents of his basket changed from hogweed to firewood and eventually to yellow earth.",
  ["1001050301_2"]="Wushi — Part I",
  ["1001050301_20"]="The crop was not plentiful, but it was enough to satisfy their stomachs.",
  ["1001050301_21"]="The firewood he cut was not abundant, but it was sufficient for the winter.",
  ["1001050301_22"]="The yellow earth he dug out was not profuse, but it was enough to make the earthen wall for their new house.",
  ["1001050301_23"]="Every bit of weight on his shoulders became the cornerstone of a better life.",
  ["1001050301_24"]="He firmly believed in that.",
  ["1001050301_25"]="He felt content with what he had.",
  ["1001050301_26"]="Whenever he handed over the heavy basket to his mother, she would gently stroke his hair and praise him for a job well done.",
  ["1001050301_27"]="The warmth left in his hair guided him on his walks in the night without any candlelight.",
  ["1001050301_28"]="Time passed swiftly.",
  ["1001050301_29"]="And so he grew up.",
  ["1001050301_3"]="The mountains surrounding the Western Region were tall, distant, and cold.",
  ["1001050301_30"]="His life was never affluent, but the family held onto the belief that everything would become better.",
  ["1001050301_31"]="It was at that moment that a new life quietly joined his family.",
  ["1001050301_32"]="He vaguely remembered it was autumn.",
  ["1001050301_33"]="The twilight was beautiful, casting a warm carpet of afterglow on the road back home.",
  ["1001050301_34"]="Upon his return, he saw his father, brimming with joy, and his mother, blushing slightly.",
  ["1001050301_35"]="Just as he set down the basket, his father lifted him up high, turned him around, and placed him in front of his mother.",
  ["1001050301_36"]="You're making a fuss. What if you drop him?",
  ["1001050301_37"]="His mother playfully scolded his father then extended her hand towards him.",
  ["1001050301_38"]="He expected his mother to ruffle his hair as usual.",
  ["1001050301_39"]="However, her hand gently rested on his left hand, guiding it together to touch her abdomen.",
  ["1001050301_4"]="Together with the sun, they overlooked this desolate world.",
  ["1001050301_40"]="You know... you're going to have a sibling.",
  ["1001050301_41"]="The woman spoke softly.",
  ["1001050301_42"]="His eyes widened slightly.",
  ["1001050301_43"]="Be a good brother, will you?",
  ["1001050301_44"]="She looked at him with a smile in her eyes, her voice unusually tender.",
  ["1001050301_45"]="The warmth from his hand gradually seeped into his heart.",
  ["1001050301_46"]="The life nurtured in his mother's womb grew bigger with each passing day.",
  ["1001050301_47"]="When a traveling merchant passed by, his father traded one of their calves for a jar of huangjiu.",
  ["1001050301_48"]="The Western Region did not produce glutinous grain, and this wine made from glutinous rice and brown sugar was known as \"Maiden Rose.\" It was a custom in Jiangyin Region to prepare it when welcoming the birth of a daughter.",
  ["1001050301_49"]="They would open the jar when a daughter got married, hoping for her long and healthy life and the prosperity of the family.",
  ["1001050301_5"]="On one side of the mountains lies barren yellow earth.",
  ["1001050301_50"]="His mother chuckled and gently scolded his father for being wasteful when they didn't even know the gender of the baby.",
  ["1001050301_51"]="His father simply smiled while tending to the soil, expressing his certainty that it would be an adorable girl.",
  ["1001050301_52"]="It's going to be a sweet girl, don't you think?",
  ["1001050301_53"]="Father looked at him, winking, as if seeking his approval.",
  ["1001050301_54"]="So he approached his mother's side and quietly crouched in her arms, pressing his ear against her belly.",
  ["1001050301_55"]="The pulsation of life reached his ears through the thin layer of flesh, eventually settling in his heart.",
  ["1001050301_56"]="A tender life was taking root, and its arrival would complete the family.",
  ["1001050301_57"]="Yes.",
  ["1001050301_58"]="He nodded.",
  ["1001050301_59"]="His father laughed and commended him, mentioning the importance of taking care of his future sister.",
  ["1001050301_6"]="The Grandeur River flowed for thousands of miles, nurturing all living beings but leaving only a few drops to quench the thirst of its origin.",
  ["1001050301_60"]="Then he dug a hole under the tree near the field, preparing to bury the jar.",
  ["1001050301_61"]="He gazed at his father's bustling figure and quietly felt the movements in his mother's abdomen.",
  ["1001050301_62"]="It would probably be a girl, and if so, she would be the most precious child in the world to him.",
  ["1001050301_63"]="He imagined carrying her in his basket, ensuring that her tender feet never touched the rough gravel road.",
  ["1001050301_64"]="As she grew older, his responsibility would become heavier.",
  ["1001050301_65"]="And when it became too much for him, he would place her on the back of the old ox, walking together with her in the fields and adorning her ears with beautiful rice flowers.",
  ["1001050301_66"]="With these wonderful thoughts in mind, he closed his eyes and fell into a deep sleep.",
  ["1001050301_7"]="He failed to remember that a long, long time ago, he had a different name.",
  ["1001050301_8"]="While the land was desolate, it allowed for the growth of weeds.",
  ["1001050301_9"]="The Western Path meandered through the mountains, serving as a crucial route into the Western Region. It was difficult to traverse, with many sections accessible only to porters, mules, and horses.",

  ["1001050401_3"]="As we safeguard the transport fleet out of the downtown area of CangLin City, we notice a familiar cerulean hue by the roadside on the outskirts.",
  ["1001050401_4"]="Did the first fleet encounter issues again today? Alright, I see... Oh, Xin? There you are.",
  ["1001050401_5"]="You're just in time. I've been overwhelmed here.",
  ["1001050401_6"]="CangLin City is sending out grain from the city, and the grain trucks are all waiting nearby. Come and lend us a hand.",
  ["1001050401_7"]="The Bureau of Roads & Travel is transporting stored grain to various regions, and all highways and railroads are at full capacity. The Wellbeing Office is coordinating with other regions to ensure that transportation fleets from CangLin City are given priority.",
  ["1001050401_8"]="But recently, the biological mutations caused by the water have intensified, and contaminated animals have started attacking transportation fleets and workers constantly.",
  ["1001050401_9"]="Ordinary people can barely perceive anomalies. They can't see the true nature of what we see and can't defend themselves against such attacks.",
  ["1001050402_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001050402_10"]="Intrigued by the topic, the driver, while keeping his gaze fixed on the road ahead, cannot help but strike up a conversation with us.",
  ["1001050402_11"]="You've never been there, have you? That's my hometown, about 2,000 kilometers away from Jiangyin Region. Jiangyin Region is great, by the way. We only harvest once a year there, unlike here where they do it three times a year.",
  ["1001050402_12"]="Really? But why did you come all the way here?",
  ["1001050402_13"]="Heh, nothing much. We've got two guys from the Western Region in Truck No. 2. They heard that Jiangyin Region needed help, so they drove day and night for over 3,000 kilometers to get here!",
  ["1001050402_14"]="By the time we deliver the supplies to Northland Region, they'll have practically traveled across all of Qian!",
  ["1001050402_15"]="Let's see, the girl in Truck No. 5 is from Hanze Region, the young man in Truck No. 17 is from the Central Region, and the father and son in Truck No. 24 are from Northland Region. In short, we've got people from all over Qian.",
  ["1001050402_16"]="I've covered the longest distance among these folks, so they consider me their captain.",
  ["1001050402_17"]="Honestly, I was supposed to retire and go back home last month, but with the current situation, I'll do whatever I can. Many people in Northland Region are in desperate need of food.",
  ["1001050402_18"]="I've traveled over eight million kilometers in my life, so driving a few thousand kilometers at the last minute is no big deal.",
  ["1001050402_19"]="Besides, it's nothing compared to the situation in the Western Region back then.",
  ["1001050402_2"]="Despite the twists and turns, we have managed to safely escort the workers to the transportation fleet.",
  ["1001050402_20"]="Those were truly tough days. Even though we received food supplies in the Western Path, the road was too narrow for trucks, so we had to rely on human labor and mules.",
  ["1001050402_21"]="In the end, we had to build roads while carrying food on foot over the mountains.",
  ["1001050402_22"]="After one trip, your feet would be killing you! Seriously, it's nothing like now, where you can just chill in an air-conditioned car...",
  ["1001050402_23"]="...",
  ["1001050402_24"]="Abruptly, the captain stops talking.",
  ["1001050402_25"]="Along the road leading out of the city, an unending line of trucks stretches as far as the eye can see. Empty trucks pour into the city while loaded ones surge out carrying goods.",
  ["1001050402_26"]="This is amazing. How many trucks do they have here?",
  ["1001050402_27"]="Well, that young government guy was blabbering yesterday, saying we need to transport at least 40 million tons of grain to different parts of Qian during the fall and winter seasons.",
  ["1001050402_28"]="If each truck carries a full load of forty tons, that adds up to a million truckloads, and that's where we're at roughly.",
  ["1001050402_29"]="Of course, not all the grain is transported by road. There are also railways and waterways.",
  ["1001050402_3"]="Hey, you must be the government guards, right? Thank you! Hop in the passenger seat, and if anything comes up, I'm counting on you!",
  ["1001050402_30"]="The river port and seaport in the city are packed with ships that spontaneously came to help with grain transportation. And there are a bunch of big ships waiting at sea for a spot to dock.",
  ["1001050402_31"]="If we put in a little more effort, we might just have the Harvest Festival on time this year.",
  ["1001050402_32"]="Alright, enough chit-chat. I'm focusing on driving. I'm responsible for what's on this truck, and I'm counting on you to handle what's up ahead!",
  ["1001050402_4"]="Truck No. 1 here, calling all trucks! Check the headcount, trucks, cargo, and fuel level!",
  ["1001050402_5"]="Alright, we're good to go! Listen up, everyone! Follow the truck ahead of you! Let's hit the road!",
  ["1001050402_6"]="I should give you the rundown on our fleet, but time is against us, so let's skip the formalities!",
  ["1001050402_7"]="We've got thirty trucks in total: six loaded with flour, ten with rice, one carrying cooking oil, nine with fruits and veggies, and the last four are refrigerated trucks carrying meat.",
  ["1001050402_8"]="We're starting from CangLin City and heading all the way up to the Northland Region. Our job is to escort them to the next checkpoint outside the city, where the Cerulean Blight hasn't affected the animals yet.",
  ["1001050402_9"]="Northland Region?",
  ["1001050501_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001050501_10"]="Are these water pipes?",
  ["1001050501_11"]="Yeah, exactly. We'd better fill in the gaps soon, or we'll be losing tons of water down the drain.",
  ["1001050501_12"]="Oh, if you're thirsty, help yourself to a drink. Don't worry, this water is not from the contaminated Grandeur River. It's actually clean water transferred from the north through the Water Diversion Project.",
  ["1001050501_13"]="The Water Diversion Project?",
  ["1001050501_14"]="I get why you're confused. Initially, the Water Diversion Project was meant to bring water from the Grandeur River to the north.",
  ["1001050501_15"]="But a few days ago, the Wellbeing Office ordered a reversal of the water transfer. They wanted to raise the water level in the northern reservoir to address the water shortage in CangLin City.",
  ["1001050501_16"]="The problem is, this situation wasn't anticipated during the project's design. As a result, the main channel is pretty far from CangLin City and other populated areas.",
  ["1001050501_17"]="So, we received the task of building temporary water pipes.",
  ["1001050501_18"]="It's not a technically challenging job, but nobody told me we'd be dealing with those crazy oxen and birds until I arrived in CangLin City...",
  ["1001050501_19"]="So, you're not a resident in CangLin City?",
  ["1001050501_2"]="Optimization of North and South",
  ["1001050501_20"]="Nope, the city is fully focused on grain transportation, and they can't spare any manpower for laying pipelines.",
  ["1001050501_21"]="Once we heard about the orders from Fengbei, we packed up our stuff and came here, hoping we could lend a hand.",
  ["1001050501_22"]="Is everything going smoothly?",
  ["1001050501_23"]="Well, according to the plan, we're working on ten different sections of the pipeline simultaneously. In just four days, we've managed to lay down 225 kilometers of pipe. At this rate, we'll be done in another two days.",
  ["1001050501_24"]="I'm pleasantly surprised to see so many others share the same mindset. In this section alone, we've got over four hundred people from different regions who came here to help out.",
  ["1001050501_25"]="I guess everyone is hoping that if we finish laying the pipelines ahead of schedule, the Harvest Festival this year will go smoothly.",
  ["1001050501_26"]="Have those animals been attacking the pipelines all this time?",
  ["1001050501_27"]="The past few days were fine. As long as we didn't provoke those beasts, they wouldn't bother us.",
  ["1001050501_28"]="But lately, I don't know what's happened. They seem to be attracted to something and have started attacking our pipelines in a more organized way.",
  ["1001050501_29"]="I see. Let's go see what's going on.",
  ["1001050501_3"]="Thanks, guys, you can leave us here. Someone else will take care of us from now on.",
  ["1001050501_4"]="Huh? What's going on up ahead? Is construction work causing the blockage?",
  ["1001050501_5"]="What's wrong with these animals? Get them out of here! Protect the pipeline! Don't let these crazy oxen damage it!",
  ["1001050501_6"]="Those oxen are contaminated, but those workers are mistaking them for ordinary livestock. They'll get hurt if we don't intervene.",
  ["1001050501_7"]="Before Qing makes a move, Xin already rushes out with her spear.",
  ["1001050501_8"]="Thank you so much for your timely help.",
  ["1001050501_9"]="Seriously, we're stretched thin on manpower. We have to build the pipelines while dealing with these mad animals.",
  ["1001050502_1"]="Finally, all the animals have been driven away.",
  ["1001050502_10"]="Ah, more errands to run. By the way, who's that former director?",
  ["1001050502_11"]="I'll personally go meet him, so come along with me, Xin. And you, Head Librarian, if you are not too busy, I'd appreciate it if you could come, too.",
  ["1001050502_12"]="It's no exaggeration to say that he was the one who established CangLin City.",
  ["1001050502_2"]="Before you leave, a driver steps forward from the group.",
  ["1001050502_3"]="Who's in charge here?",
  ["1001050502_4"]="It's me. What's up?",
  ["1001050502_5"]="Before I left, I was instructed to bring a soil sample to CangLin City.",
  ["1001050502_6"]="This sample is from Fengbei, and it's supposed to be delivered to the former head of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture.",
  ["1001050502_7"]="Sure, I'll take care of it.",
  ["1001050502_8"]="Hmm? This label says \"moon soil\"?",
  ["1001050502_9"]="This is a sample of moon soil sent from Fengbei. Please deliver it to the former director of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture as soon as possible.",
  ["1001050601_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",

  ["1001050601_13"]="When will you finally bring your salvation to this land?",
  ["1001050601_14"]="He sighs repeatedly, offering his prayers time and time again.",
  ["1001050601_15"]="In response, carried by the wind, comes the cry of a child.",
  ["1001050601_16"]="As always, the sound awakens him from his slumber.",
  ["1001050601_17"]="Huh? Isn't this place...?",
  ["1001050601_18"]="Hmm? What's the matter, Xin? Have you been here before.",
  ["1001050601_19"]="Why do you look surprised, too, Head Librarian? Could it be that you have...",
  ["1001050601_2"]="Husbandry and Agriculture",
  ["1001050601_20"]="Yes, I have been here.",
  ["1001050601_21"]="I know this place.",
  ["1001050601_22"]="As the door slowly opens, I see the face of the old man whom I encountered several nights ago.",
  ["1001050601_23"]="It has only been a few days, but Nong Ji appears to have aged significantly.",
  ["1001050601_24"]="His grizzled hair has become thin and dull, resembling withered cattails in winter.",
  ["1001050601_25"]="His gaze seems somewhat disoriented, as if he has just awakened from a nap.",
  ["1001050601_26"]="Qing? And [BBNAME]?",
  ["1001050601_27"]="Mr. Nong! Do you know [BBNAME]?",
  ["1001050601_28"]="Well, it's a long story, but in simple terms, it's fate...",
  ["1001050601_29"]="So, that's how it is. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by Xin and [BBNAME].",
  ["1001050601_3"]="As he gazes upon the scorched landscape, he realizes that he is in the midst of a dream.",
  ["1001050601_30"]="Qing looks at me solemnly and continues speaking.",
  ["1001050601_31"]="Please allow me to reintroduce him. This is the founder of CangLin City and the first director of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture, Mr. Nong Ji.",
  ["1001050601_32"]="Nong Ji casually waves a hand.",
  ["1001050601_33"]="No need to be so formal. I had enough of official talk long before retiring.",
  ["1001050601_34"]="Don't stand at the door. Just come inside.",
  ["1001050601_35"]="Mr. Nong, this is a soil sample that was delivered yesterday. It was specifically sent to you from Fengbei.",
  ["1001050601_36"]="Oh! I've been waiting for this for a long time! Let me see... the particle size and composition appear to be correct. It's exactly the soil sample I've been searching for!",
  ["1001050601_37"]="What exactly is this, old man? It's not actual moon soil, is it? Are you really planning to use it for farming?",
  ["1001050601_38"]="Mind your manners, Xin!",
  ["1001050601_39"]="Heh, of course, it's not real moon soil. They only obtained a small amount of moon soil from the lunar exploration program, and even the research institutes don't have enough to share. It would be far too extravagant for an old man like me to indulge in such a luxury.",
  ["1001050601_4"]="This desolate terrain has haunted him for most of his life.",
  ["1001050601_40"]="This is an imitation of moon soil created by synthesizing earth minerals based on the characteristics of actual moon soil. Apart from their different origins, the two are essentially identical.",
  ["1001050601_41"]="And yes, it's indeed used for farming.",
  ["1001050601_42"]="One day, humans will inhabit the moon and even planets beyond it. Although we may not live long enough to witness that day, future generations will.",
  ["1001050601_43"]="As their predecessors, it is our responsibility to ensure an ample food supply for their journey.",
  ["1001050601_44"]="The announcement about seeking refuge in the city was made long ago, Mr. Nong, and most residents in the outskirts have already retreated to the city before the situation worsened. Why are you still here?",
  ["1001050601_45"]="Huh?",
  ["1001050601_46"]="Well, because I haven't finished the task at hand.",
  ["1001050601_47"]="I have a small lab at the back of this house for space cultivation. The temperature and humidity inside simulate the conditions of a moon base.",
  ["1001050601_48"]="Unfortunately, I can't replicate lunar gravity, but that can't be helped.",
  ["1001050601_49"]="I've selected several crops that may be suitable for growing on the moon, hoping that some of them will meet the production needs of lunar bases in the future.",
  ["1001050601_5"]="He has grown so accustomed to it that sometimes it is hard to distinguish whether it is his nightmare or an old friend.",
  ["1001050601_50"]="I have planted rice in all the previous moon soil samples. However, none of the crops have sprouted yet...",
  ["1001050601_51"]="I understand. Your determination remains steadfast as always, but I wonder if your health allows for such dedication?",
  ["1001050601_52"]="Well, don't worry about that. All old men like me are racing against time, and that is why I must push myself as far as I can.",
  ["1001050601_53"]="Since this is your wish, we will no longer trouble you.",
  ["1001050601_54"]="Heh, not so fast. You've been busy all this time. Are you hungry now?",
  ["1001050601_55"]="He cares for us like a parent.",
  ["1001050601_56"]="Nothing is more important than having enough food. Come and have a meal.",
  ["1001050601_57"]="Qing remains silent for a while before eventually nodding.",
  ["1001050601_58"]="Even as an impartial executive, she simply cannot refuse the genuine hospitality of an elder.",
  ["1001050601_59"]="The aroma of rice soon fills the small room.",
  ["1001050601_6"]="*sigh*",
  ["1001050601_60"]="Come to think of it, this is the second time I have had a meal here.",
  ["1001050601_61"]="Nong Ji is still busy in the kitchen.",
  ["1001050601_62"]="Is it ready yet? Is it ready yet? My stomach is growling!",
  ["1001050601_63"]="Be patient, Xin.",
  ["1001050601_64"]="Don't be so strict, Qing. I rarely have a chance to talk to young folks like little Xin.",
  ["1001050601_65"]="You have never experienced famine, and you don't know how terrible hunger can be.",
  ["1001050601_66"]="You're right. Excuse me, Mr. Nong, [BBNAME] and I will step outside for some fresh air.",
  ["1001050601_67"]="Outside the house.",
  ["1001050601_68"]="Feel free to ask whatever you want. You seem to have a lot of questions, and that's why I brought you out, too.",
  ["1001050601_69"]="...",
  ["1001050601_7"]="The earth, the arid earth.",
  ["1001050601_70"]="I hesitate for a moment.",
  ["1001050601_71"]="Qing seems to understand the reason for my hesitation.",
  ["1001050601_72"]="I believe you've heard a lot about the terrible famine in the Western Region during your journey, right?",
  ["1001050601_73"]="(Nod)",
  ["1001050601_74"]="Even though everyone who mentioned it tried to speak in the calmest way possible...",
  ["1001050601_75"]="That is precisely what made me realize that it is a wound that has not fully healed.",
  ["1001050601_76"]="I don't have the right to pry into someone's affairs directly.",
  ["1001050601_77"]="It's not something to be avoided, actually. It's just that I didn't find a good time to tell you about it.",
  ["1001050601_78"]="Qing lets out a long sigh.",
  ["1001050601_79"]="The famine occurred about fifteen years ago...",
  ["1001050601_8"]="He squats down and gently cups the fragments of soil, treating it with a tenderness akin to that of a lover.",
  ["1001050601_9"]="Yet, the sand slips through his fingers, eluding his grasp.",
  ["1001050701_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001050701_10"]="Countless accounts in books have described such disasters, which have occurred repeatedly throughout history.",
  ["1001050701_100"]="That is what his father said, and it was what neighbors comforted each other with.",
  ["1001050701_101"]="However, once again, the following spring arrived without a single drop of rain.",
  ["1001050701_102"]="How long did the prolonged drought persist?",
  ["1001050701_103"]="How long did their futile hope endure?",
  ["1001050701_104"]="And when did he become numb to everything?",
  ["1001050701_105"]="Tears were long forgotten, just like the rain.",
  ["1001050701_106"]="With his basket empty, the boy walked barefoot on his way home.",
  ["1001050701_107"]="The gravel under his feet brought pain, but not nearly as intense as that of the beast clawing at his stomach.",
  ["1001050701_108"]="The wind rustled through the boy's hair.",
  ["1001050701_109"]="So he raised his eyes.",
  ["1001050701_11"]="The barren land would be filled with starving people. After consuming the last grain of rice, they would resort to gnawing on tree bark and soil until their bodies could no longer bear the weight, eventually collapsing and turning into dust.",
  ["1001050701_110"]="...",
  ["1001050701_111"]="Surprisingly, there was not a single intact tree alongside the path back home.",
  ["1001050701_112"]="All trees within thousands of miles had been stripped bare.",
  ["1001050701_113"]="Suddenly, he heard a voice not far away.",
  ["1001050701_114"]="He turned back and unexpectedly locked eyes with a person sitting under a tree.",
  ["1001050701_115"]="The boy hesitated to describe the person as a \"man\" because his eyes had an unsettling gleam when he saw the boy.",
  ["1001050701_116"]="The weeds and bark were no longer enough to satisfy the hunger within that man's stomach.",
  ["1001050701_117"]="As the man dropped the weeds he was carrying, the boy took a step back.",
  ["1001050701_118"]="Ah...",
  ["1001050701_119"]="He heard the growling of hunger.",
  ["1001050701_12"]="Eventually, the entire tragedy will be summarized in a simple line: \"In the year XXX, a great famine struck the Western Region.\" Then, this page of history will be casually turned over.",
  ["1001050701_120"]="Only it was no longer a small beast: it was a ravenous brute that had devoured humanity.",
  ["1001050701_121"]="The man relentless pursued the boy, following close behind.",
  ["1001050701_122"]="The boy could not recall how he made it home.",
  ["1001050701_123"]="All he knew was that from that day forward, his father forbade them from going outside.",
  ["1001050701_124"]="The rice vat became a barricade blocking the front door at night.",
  ["1001050701_125"]="When boredom struck, he and Tiaohua would press against the door, peering at the outside world through the narrow slit.",
  ["1001050701_126"]="In their limited view, there appeared to be fewer people than before, perhaps because everyone was staying at home.",
  ["1001050701_127"]="The nights became restless.",
  ["1001050701_128"]="Occasionally, a distant fire would illuminate the village, accompanied by the shouts of strangers.",
  ["1001050701_129"]="In those moments, his father would gather his family together. His mother would shield Tiaohua and the boy with her arms, while his father would stand at the front door like a silent guardian, clutching a pitchfork.",
  ["1001050701_13"]="Only by personally traversing the mountains that separated the Western Region from the eastern parts of Qian could one truly comprehend the weight carried by a mere page of history.",
  ["1001050701_130"]="The pitchfork never left his father's side.",
  ["1001050701_131"]="And what happened next?",
  ["1001050701_132"]="That fateful night would forever be etched in his memory.",
  ["1001050701_133"]="On that night, his mother slept in the cellar with him, holding Tiaohua in her arms.",
  ["1001050701_134"]="In the dead of night, footsteps from above reverberated through the cellar, pacing directly overhead.",
  ["1001050701_135"]="Then he heard his father's voice—first a conversation, then an angry shout, followed by a plea.",
  ["1001050701_136"]="Finally, the cellar door swung open, and his father stepped inside, locking eyes with his mother.",
  ["1001050701_137"]="Send her away. She's still young, perhaps she can find enough to eat out there.",
  ["1001050701_138"]="If we had sent her away back then, she wouldn't have had to suffer all these years.",
  ["1001050701_139"]="With tears in her eyes, his mother handed Tiaohua over to his father.",
  ["1001050701_14"]="Thousands of lives and the immeasurable suffering they endured were condensed into a few lines within the Imperial History Pavilion in the distant QingYu City.",
  ["1001050701_140"]="Tiaohua rubbed her sleepy eyes in confusion, unaware of her impending fate in that moment.",
  ["1001050701_141"]="The boy, however, clung desperately to his father's leg, his fingertips reaching out to touch the corner of Tiaohua's clothes, resembling a dog that has had its spine stepped on.",
  ["1001050701_142"]="Momentarily taken aback, his father forcefully kicked him away. In that instant, both saw profound grief reflected in the other's eyes.",
  ["1001050701_143"]="The boy did not retract his hand, and his father did not relent.",
  ["1001050701_144"]="...",
  ["1001050701_145"]="After the stranger left, their home became even more desolate.",
  ["1001050701_146"]="His mother fell silent, no longer speaking or shedding tears.",
  ["1001050701_147"]="The \"dog,\" with his broken spine, lay motionless on the ground, emitting hoarse cries.",
  ["1001050701_15"]="Wushi.",
  ["1001050701_16"]="Wushi.",
  ["1001050701_17"]="Only flowers. Not a single fruit.",
  ["1001050701_18"]="His parents sighed as they beheld the dried soil in the field.",
  ["1001050701_19"]="He stood in the field, observing his father's stooped back, which resembled an old tree. The first thought that entered his mind was the life about to be born from his mother's womb.",
  ["1001050701_2"]="Wushi — Part II",
  ["1001050701_20"]="The remaining grain in their rice vat would sustain the family for only the current year.",
  ["1001050701_21"]="By the time the baby is born, there would likely be nothing left but rice bran to boil in the pot.",
  ["1001050701_22"]="Grain husk, rice bran, and peanut shell.",
  ["1001050701_23"]="While terrible tasting, these things are still edible.",
  ["1001050701_24"]="However, what would happen if even these provisions were exhausted?",
  ["1001050701_25"]="Tree bark, leaves, and then, eventually, soil.",
  ["1001050701_26"]="Was there such a cruel world awaiting her when she opened her eyes?",
  ["1001050701_27"]="The boy closed his eyes, choosing not to dwell on such a future.",
  ["1001050701_28"]="As time slipped away, joy transformed into sorrow.",
  ["1001050701_29"]="Instead of the sweet rain that nurtures all life, the first thing to touch this land was the tears of a newborn baby.",
  ["1001050701_3"]="The boy's sweet dream was abruptly shattered.",
  ["1001050701_30"]="When the girl's cry echoed through the room, there was no joy on the face of the father sitting outside the door, but only a long sigh escaped his lips.",
  ["1001050701_31"]="The profound sorrow within the father's heart seemed to linger in the air like thick smoke, reluctant to dissipate. It wrapped around everyone's hearts, becoming an invisible shackle.",
  ["1001050701_32"]="When the midwife walked out with the newborn girl in her arms, the father beheld her flushed face, unsure of what to say.",
  ["1001050701_33"]="What will be her name?",
  ["1001050701_34"]="The aged midwife's request carried a hint of hesitation.",
  ["1001050701_35"]="The father's face twitched. Despite his obvious effort, his lips failed to curl into a smile.",
  ["1001050701_36"]="He tenderly held the fragile life in his hands, his voice sounding like a piece of rice paper dropped in water.",
  ["1001050701_37"]="Though soft, his words seemed on the verge of crumbling.",
  ["1001050701_38"]="Tiaohua. Let's call her Tiaohua.",
  ["1001050701_39"]="It was a long time before the boy finally grasped the meaning behind her name, \"trumpet creeper.\"",
  ["1001050701_4"]="In the following year, an unprecedented natural catastrophe struck the land.",
  ["1001050701_40"]="...",
  ["1001050701_41"]="Trumpet creeper blooms, yellow hue aglow. Yet my heart's burdened, with sorrow's woe. Leaves of green grace the creeper's vine. Had I known life's path, I'd decline. Starlight's gentle caress on famished souls. Yet the flower's nutrition cannot make them whole.",
  ["1001050701_42"]="...",
  ["1001050701_43"]="...",
  ["1001050701_44"]="If I had known my life would be like this, I wouldn't have chosen to come into this world.",
  ["1001050701_45"]="After giving birth to Tiaohua, her mother's health deteriorated.",
  ["1001050701_46"]="The harsh environment took its toll. Despite the family's best efforts, the frail woman could produce only a few drops of milk.",
  ["1001050701_47"]="The baby girl gradually grew paler, and the distressed woman held her close, overcome with tears.",
  ["1001050701_48"]="Why did she have no choice but to witness the decline of this beloved life?",
  ["1001050701_49"]="...",
  ["1001050701_5"]="Throughout the entire Western Region, not a single drop of rain fell during the spring, resulting in a prolonged drought. By the time summer arrived, the soil had become dry and loose, and even the most resilient crops could not survive in the harsh environment.",
  ["1001050701_50"]="One afternoon, while his mother was in a deep sleep, his father placed Tiaohua into his arms.",
  ["1001050701_51"]="The traveling merchant hasn't gone too far away.",
  ["1001050701_52"]="Although his father's words were brief, he immediately understood their meaning.",
  ["1001050701_53"]="The boy stared at his father in astonishment, while his father simply closed his eyes.",
  ["1001050701_54"]="Cradling his sister, the boy felt an intangible noose silently tightening around his neck.",
  ["1001050701_55"]="It was as if time had frozen, leaving the world in shades of gray.",
  ["1001050701_56"]="...",
  ["1001050701_57"]="It wasn't until his sister's hunger broke the stillness that the subtle sound awakened him and the world resumed its motion.",
  ["1001050701_58"]="The boy suddenly realized that he was holding his sister in his arms, some distance away from home.",
  ["1001050701_59"]="He gazed blankly at the path ahead, a path he had traveled alone countless times.",
  ["1001050701_6"]="The cracked yellow soil was inhospitable, unable to nurture even the smallest seedling or the tiniest insect.",
  ["1001050701_60"]="The boy had envisioned accompanying his sister on this road countless times before, watching her grow from a toddler into a beautiful lady.",
  ["1001050701_61"]="And now, he felt as though he was shattering that future with his own hands.",
  ["1001050701_62"]="The collision between his hopeful vision and harsh reality tore at his thoughts and soul.",
  ["1001050701_63"]="The boy lowered his head, allowing the noose around his neck to tighten, and looked at his baby sister.",
  ["1001050701_64"]="Hungry, her tiny hands reached out into emptiness, searching for her mother's breast.",
  ["1001050701_65"]="Out of compassion, the boy reached out and gently clasped her tiny fist.",
  ["1001050701_66"]="The baby stared him for a long while. Just when the boy thought she might cry, she babbled and grinned instead.",
  ["1001050701_67"]="The boy remained frozen in place for a long time.",
  ["1001050701_68"]="For a very, very long time.",
  ["1001050701_69"]="Then he smiled back.",
  ["1001050701_7"]="Even the resilient trees gradually succumbed to the relentless sandy winds.",
  ["1001050701_70"]="Ha... Ha-ha...",
  ["1001050701_71"]="As he laughed, the boy noticed a few drops of moisture on Tiaohua's face.",
  ["1001050701_72"]="Was it raining?",
  ["1001050701_73"]="He looked up in ecstasy, but all he saw was the empty expanse of the sky, devoid of even a single cloud.",
  ["1001050701_74"]="The liquid trickled down his cheek.",
  ["1001050701_75"]="Then it dawned on him that it was not the long-expected sweet rain: it was tears welling up in his own eyes.",
  ["1001050701_76"]="Ha... ha... ha-hahaha... Aarrrgh!",
  ["1001050701_77"]="Holding his sister tightly, the boy ran toward their home.",
  ["1001050701_78"]="His laughter resonated loudly, while his tears streamed down his face.",
  ["1001050701_79"]="It was autumn.",
  ["1001050701_8"]="The inhabitants of this region were well acquainted with the inevitable consequences.",
  ["1001050701_80"]="The setting sun emanated a sanguine hue. As he was returning home, it felt like an exodus.",
  ["1001050701_81"]="The new spring arrived, but the chill surpassed that of winter.",
  ["1001050701_82"]="Spring's neck, so short, lacks warmth's embrace. Crops, they struggle 'neath cold's icy chase...",
  ["1001050701_83"]="His father sat upon the ridge of the field, softly humming to the dry, cracked soil.",
  ["1001050701_84"]="Beginning of Spring, Rain Water, Awakening of Insects, Vernal Equinox, Fresh Green, and Grain Rain...",
  ["1001050701_85"]="In the following year in the Western Region, not a single drop of rain fell.",
  ["1001050701_86"]="Solar terms associated with \"rain\" and \"water\" brought no sweet showers. When autumn came, the harvest failed to materialize.",
  ["1001050701_87"]="On the parched land, the withered grass and leaves were as yellow as the people's faces.",
  ["1001050701_88"]="Perhaps the only solace in this living hell was the innocent smile of the girl.",
  ["1001050701_89"]="The impoverished family had entrusted their best hopes to their young daughter. Although she managed to grow up, she remained as frail as when she was an infant, akin to a withered sapling.",
  ["1001050701_9"]="Drought, crop failure, and famine followed as a result. If the next year followed the same pattern, it would become a catastrophe.",
  ["1001050701_90"]="However, the girl rarely shed tears, as if she had exhausted them all on the day of her birth.",
  ["1001050701_91"]="She neither cried nor fussed, exuding a quiet and well-behaved demeanor that tugged at his heartstrings.",
  ["1001050701_92"]="Perhaps because her older brother had absorbed all the nourishment from his mother, Tiaohua had been frail and sickly since childhood.",
  ["1001050701_93"]="His mother began teaching Tiaohua to read and write, and the girl proved to be a quick learner, surpassing all the boys.",
  ["1001050701_94"]="Once, Tiaohua pointed to a word in her book, wanting to know its pronunciation. Her mother paused for a moment but did not pronounce the word in the end.",
  ["1001050701_95"]="He went to see the word Tiaohua was pointing to. It was \"satiety.\"",
  ["1001050701_96"]="...",
  ["1001050701_97"]="From a certain point, he started hearing a sound, a sound that came from everyone's stomach, resembling the whimper of a beast.",
  ["1001050701_98"]="It felt as if a tiny beast was scratching inside everyone's stomach, demanding food.",
  ["1001050701_99"]="Everything will be better the next spring.",
  ["1001050801_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001050801_10"]="What have you witnessed along the way, Head Librarian?",
  ["1001050801_11"]="I hope this kid will grow up in a better world. Do you think it will?",
  ["1001050801_12"]="I've traveled over eight million kilometers in my life, so driving a few thousand kilometers at the last minute is no big deal.",
  ["1001050801_13"]="Once we heard about the orders from Fengbei, we packed up our stuff and came here, hoping we could lend a hand.",
  ["1001050801_14"]="We have the most resilient people in this world. No matter how much they suffer, they never fail to rise again and continue onward, enduring their wounds.",
  ["1001050801_15"]="I think I understand what you mean.",
  ["1001050801_16"]="Moving forward, never stopping.",
  ["1001050801_17"]="CangLin City is a relatively young city. It took us five years to develop it into the granary of Qian.",
  ["1001050801_18"]="In the future, there will undoubtedly be thousands of granaries like CangLin City built on this land, providing shelter even for the poorest people.",
  ["1001050801_19"]="Is this why you hold Mr. Nong in high regard?",
  ["1001050801_2"]="Sower",
  ["1001050801_20"]="It's not just me. The entire CangLin City, as well as the people of Qian, hold Mr. Nong in high regard.",
  ["1001050801_21"]="As I mentioned earlier, it's no exaggeration to say that he was the one who established CangLin City.",
  ["1001050801_22"]="He personally experienced the famine in the Western Region and conceived the idea of CangLin City. He dedicated his life to building this city.",
  ["1001050801_23"]="His dream was to ensure that no one in Qian's borders would ever go hungry again.",
  ["1001050801_24"]="He introduced new types of rice and innovative farming methods, and under his leadership as the director of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture, the centralized agricultural system gradually took shape.",
  ["1001050801_25"]="He's indeed an extraordinary man.",
  ["1001050801_26"]="Undoubtedly. As a result, everyone calls him by a revered title: the <color=#fec66b>Sower</color>.",
  ["1001050801_27"]="This title originates from Ji Xia, the First Emperor of Qian and the ancestor of agriculture. It's used to honor those who have made significant contributions to agriculture, as if they were the reincarnation of Ji Xia.",
  ["1001050801_28"]="Has his health been deteriorating?",
  ["1001050801_29"]="He appears quite elderly.",
  ["1001050801_3"]="It is a scar that has not fully healed.",
  ["1001050801_30"]="Yeah, you're right. His health has been deteriorating lately.",
  ["1001050801_31"]="The government has repeatedly urged him to relocate to the city, not only for security reasons, but also to provide him with easier access to medical care.",
  ["1001050801_32"]="Although it's never been explicitly stated, there is genuine concern... in case one day...",
  ["1001050801_33"]="Wait a moment...",
  ["1001050801_34"]="This conversation suddenly triggers a memory buried deep within my mind.",
  ["1001050801_35"]="The announcement about seeking refuge in the city was made long ago, Mr. Nong, and most residents in the outskirts have already retreated to the city before the situation worsened. Why are you still here?",
  ["1001050801_36"]="My name is Wushi, and I'm one of the vigilantes here.",
  ["1001050801_37"]="Hmm? Is something troubling you, Head Librarian?",
  ["1001050801_38"]="No, it's just a small doubt.",
  ["1001050801_39"]="Please don't hesitate to share it.",
  ["1001050801_4"]="Although it no longer bleeds, its impact still lingers.",
  ["1001050801_40"]="Do you have vigilante squads patrolling the farmlands on the outskirts of CangLin City?",
  ["1001050801_41"]="Vigilante squads? Do you mean patrol squads organized by the residents themselves?",
  ["1001050801_42"]="Of course not. Even we found those contaminated animals to be a challenge. Neither WeiShi nor the government would ever allow ordinary people to face them.",
  ["1001050801_43"]="I see.",
  ["1001050801_44"]="Something seems off.",
  ["1001050801_45"]="If WeiShi doesn't have vigilante squads, who exactly is the young man who saved my life in the first place?",
  ["1001050801_46"]="Wait, let's pause our conversation here.",
  ["1001050801_47"]="Something stranger is happening. The water vapor is gathering!",
  ["1001050801_48"]="As Qing speaks, a significant amount of water vapor appears out of nowhere and quickly thickens, becoming visible.",
  ["1001050801_49"]="Numerous shadows emerge from the depths of the Cerulean Vapor.",
  ["1001050801_5"]="Countless horrifying things occurred during that era. The newborn Qian was frail, and it took nearly three years for its people to overcome that famine.",
  ["1001050801_50"]="Step back, Head Librarian!",
  ["1001050801_6"]="True, as Mr. Nong mentioned, I didn't personally experience that catastrophe, but there were many refugees from the Western Region in CangLin City at the time, and they were sensitive to the word \"famine.\"",
  ["1001050801_7"]="Actually, Xin... she was one of them...",
  ["1001050801_8"]="Fortunately, many of them managed to survive.",
  ["1001050801_9"]="Qing's clear eyes reflect my face.",
  ["1001050802_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001050802_10"]="What's happening? I just finished cooking. Where is Xin?",
  ["1001050802_11"]="Qing leans against the door.",
  ["1001050802_12"]="It's nothing, Mr. Nong! Please don't come out!",
  ["1001050802_13"]="...",
  ["1001050802_14"]="The old man behind the door remains silent, as if he has realized something.",
  ["1001050802_15"]="I apologize for this interruption, but we must leave to handle an emergency.",
  ["1001050802_2"]="A red figure chases a black shadow, disappearing from our sight.",
  ["1001050802_3"]="The black figure is eerily familiar, reminding me of the person who attacked Zero and me, but also of the person named...",
  ["1001050802_4"]="Xin! My waist badge!",
  ["1001050802_5"]="A response from Xin can be heard from a distance.",
  ["1001050802_6"]="I know!",
  ["1001050802_7"]="Aren't you going after the attacker?",
  ["1001050802_8"]="Do you expect me to leave you and Mr. Nong unprotected?",
  ["1001050802_9"]="Nong Ji's puzzled voice comes from behind the door.",
  ["1001050902_1"]="The dark figure dissipates on the other side of the dense vapor.",
  ["1001050902_10"]="I believe I know who he is.",
  ["1001050902_11"]="I tell Qing about the encounter I had when I first arrived.",
  ["1001050902_12"]="Immediately contact the Bureau of Employment & Social Support and Bureau of Civil Security to search for individuals matching the description.",
  ["1001050902_13"]="Found him... Wushi, born in the Western Region. He lost his parents at a young age and was later adopted. After that, he moved from place to place before finally settling in CangLin City.",
  ["1001050902_14"]="According to the records from both departments, he is a model citizen with no criminal record. He pays all taxes and social insurance on time, maintains good credit, and holds a stable job.",
  ["1001050902_15"]="Based on these records alone, he seems to be an honest man of hard fortune, and there appears to be little reason to suspect him.",
  ["1001050902_16"]="Wushi has a younger sister, who is his only living relative. I checked, and it seems that his sister is seriously ill and has been receiving medical treatment in a hospital.",
  ["1001050902_17"]="His sister's background is similar to his own, as they were both adopted at a young age. The only difference is that his sister is unable to work due to her illness and relies on Wushi to cover her medical expenses.",
  ["1001050902_18"]="Who adopted Wushi? Do we have any information about their identity?",
  ["1001050902_19"]="The adopter's information is encrypted and currently inaccessible. It was a closed adoption, so the records remain confidential.",
  ["1001050902_2"]="...",
  ["1001050902_20"]="Let's use our authority to overide the encryption.",
  ["1001050902_21"]="I'm on it. Wait, this is strange. Even we don't have the clearance?",
  ["1001050902_22"]="It seems that this adopter is someone of significance. If we want to investigate further, we will need higher-level clearance from the Wellbeing Office or Master Yuanquan himself.",
  ["1001050902_23"]="Is it possible to track his movements using the surveillance system of the Bureau of Civil Security?",
  ["1001050902_24"]="Certainly, the surveillance system indicates that he leads a regular life, primarily commuting between his residence and workplace.",
  ["1001050902_25"]="Every few days, he visits his sister in the hospital, and the timing matches the records provided by the Bureau of Health & Welfare.",
  ["1001050902_26"]="Wait, the records show another place he frequents.",
  ["1001050902_27"]="Where is it?",
  ["1001050902_28"]="Outside CangLin City, near the Grandeur River. It's the residence of... Mr. Nong Ji!",
  ["1001050902_29"]="...",
  ["1001050902_3"]="Xin clenches her teeth, reluctantly watching the figure depart.",
  ["1001050902_30"]="Could it be that these records are forged?",
  ["1001050902_31"]="A hurried figure rushes into the hall.",
  ["1001050902_32"]="No, they are not forged. I have seen that guy once, in front of that old man's house.",
  ["1001050902_33"]="Xin's stare holds a bit of viciousness.",
  ["1001050902_34"]="I'm sorry. I lost him. It's my fault. I haven't retrieved your waist badge either.",
  ["1001050902_35"]="I'll definitely go for his throat next time.",
  ["1001050902_36"]="Waist badge?",
  ["1001050902_37"]="Is it something important?",
  ["1001050902_38"]="Well, it is important because it represents my authority as the Zhi Jing of the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity.",
  ["1001050902_39"]="However, it's just a waist badge, after all, and a badge alone cannot do much.",
  ["1001050902_4"]="Qing walks silently along the way.",
  ["1001050902_40"]="All changes to government orders now have to be reviewed and approved by the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity before they can be authorized.",
  ["1001050902_41"]="Therefore, my authority is only used for the necessary step of confirmation, and having it on its own is of no use.",
  ["1001050902_42"]="...",
  ["1001050902_43"]="Moreover, as much as I hate to believe so, the primary suspect for the manipulation seems to be Mr. Nong Ji himself.",
  ["1001050902_44"]="Both accidents I had with [BBNAME] happened near his residence.",
  ["1001050902_45"]="Furthermore, all the people involved are from Eme-an and WeiShi. This can't be dismissed as a mere coincidence.",
  ["1001050902_46"]="By the way, what's the name of Wushi's sister?",
  ["1001050902_47"]="Her name is Tiaohua. She suffers from a chronic disease that currently has no cure. Her condition worsened in the early spring of this year, and the doctor predicted she wouldn't survive the summer. However, her condition has unexpectedly improved recently.",
  ["1001050902_48"]="Wait, could it be because of the Cerulean Water?",
  ["1001050902_49"]="When the name \"Tiaohua\" is mentioned, Xin shows a hint of surprise on her face, but she remains silent.",
  ["1001050902_5"]="I also remain silent, mulling over all the encounters I have had since arriving in Qian.",
  ["1001050902_50"]="...",
  ["1001050902_51"]="Unaware of Xin's unusual reaction, Qing begins to issue orders.",
  ["1001050902_52"]="Xin, mobilize manpower to monitor various regions in the city and search for Wushi.",
  ["1001050902_53"]="Also, assign someone to keep an eye on his sister at the hospital.",
  ["1001050902_54"]="As for the outskirts, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you and Zero to monitor that area, Head Librarian.",
  ["1001050902_55"]="Zero appears by my side before I realize it. Although her face is still pale, she doesn't appear as frail as before.",
  ["1001050902_56"]="Understood.",
  ["1001050902_57"]="What are you waiting for, Xin? Hurry up.",
  ["1001050902_58"]="Did you just say his sister's name is... Tiaohua?",
  ["1001050902_59"]="Yeah, why? What's up?",
  ["1001050902_6"]="Gradually, vague guesses turn into certainties.",
  ["1001050902_60"]="Oh, it's nothing. I'm leaving.",
  ["1001050902_7"]="Inside WeiShi.",
  ["1001050902_8"]="Qing, the Head Librarian seems to have something to say.",
  ["1001050902_9"]="About the person who attacked you back then...",
  ["1001051001_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001051001_10"]="*sigh*",
  ["1001051001_11"]="He puts his hands together.",
  ["1001051001_12"]="O, Bodhisattva... Bodhisattva...",
  ["1001051001_13"]="Are you seeing it?",
  ["1001051001_14"]="In this place...",
  ["1001051001_15"]="Someone is suffering the greatest pain.",
  ["1001051001_16"]="Someone is enduring the deepest misery.",
  ["1001051001_17"]="O, Bodhisattva... Bodhisattva...",
  ["1001051001_18"]="As he looks back, tears fall from the corners of his eyes.",
  ["1001051001_19"]="The drops fall on a dry plant, moistening its branches and leaves.",
  ["1001051001_2"]="The Harvest Festival",
  ["1001051001_20"]="And then, a hint of green quietly flourishes.",
  ["1001051001_21"]="...",
  ["1001051001_22"]="When he wakes up from his dream, he feels the wetness in the corner of his eyes.",
  ["1001051001_23"]="Fortunately, our second visit did not bother Nong Ji.",
  ["1001051001_24"]="Even when I requested to stay overnight, he did not refuse.",
  ["1001051001_25"]="I've been having trouble sleeping these days. You know, people tend to think about nonsense when they get older. Now that you're willing to stay here with me, of course I'm happy to have you.",
  ["1001051001_26"]="Only a day has passed, and he looks even more worn-out.",
  ["1001051001_27"]="His body appears emaciated, and his beard and hair are dry, resembling the wick of a lamp that has been burning for a long night and is about to extinguish. It is hard to fathom what has been sustaining him as he dedicates himself to his research.",
  ["1001051001_28"]="...",
  ["1001051001_29"]="...",
  ["1001051001_3"]="The wilderness in his dream is covered with a thin layer of dry grass.",
  ["1001051001_30"]="Neither Zero nor I say anything.",
  ["1001051001_31"]="According to Qing's conclusion, the old man in front of us is the culprit responsible for the current state of the city.",
  ["1001051001_32"]="However, I cannot help but question it.",
  ["1001051001_33"]="For some reason, I feel strong resistance to this theory.",
  ["1001051001_34"]="Are you hungry? Let's have lunch together. I've reheated the cold meal from yesterday.",
  ["1001051001_35"]="We left in a hurry that day, and the feast Nong Ji prepared remained untouched. Now he has reheated it and brought it to the table.",
  ["1001051001_36"]="Nong Ji serves me a bowl of rice.",
  ["1001051001_37"]="Just as I am about to accept it, Zero takes the bowl and starts digging in.",
  ["1001051001_38"]="...",
  ["1001051001_39"]="Her movements are graceful and composed, yet incredibly fast, and she finishes the bowl in an instant.",
  ["1001051001_4"]="He starts walking on the scorched earth.",
  ["1001051001_40"]="Hah, you must be starving. Don't worry, there's plenty more.",
  ["1001051001_41"]="Thank you. It's delicious.",
  ["1001051001_42"]="Nong Ji smiles with joy and turns to serve me more food.",
  ["1001051001_43"]="Zero glances at me and whispers softly so only we can hear.",
  ["1001051001_44"]="Rest assured, the food is safe.",
  ["1001051001_45"]="After we finish the meal, the room returns to its previous tranquility.",
  ["1001051001_46"]="Mr. Nong, I wonder where the Harvest Festival started?",
  ["1001051001_47"]="I try to strike up a conversation.",
  ["1001051001_48"]="The Harvest Festival? Well, actually, it was just around ten years ago.",
  ["1001051001_49"]="It's not like the traditions of Qian, and it wasn't initially intended as a festival.",
  ["1001051001_5"]="The road ahead is full of bumps, and he struggles.",
  ["1001051001_50"]="Huh?",
  ["1001051001_51"]="Soon after the famine in the Western Region broke out, the Wellbeing Office started the project to expand the Western Path to ensure the smooth transportation of supplies.",
  ["1001051001_52"]="I remember clearly that the last bridge on the Western Path was completed in the fall, and the entire line was finished and opened for traffic on the Autumn Equinox.",
  ["1001051001_53"]="CangLin City was also established that year. The first grain train departed from CangLin Station, delivering freshly harvested rice and wheat to the Western Region.",
  ["1001051001_54"]="At that time, I thought such a significant event deserved a celebration, so I organized a small ceremony before the train departed.",
  ["1001051001_55"]="But when the announcement was published in the newspaper, the number of attendees far exceeded my expectations. It was only later that I realized many of the people who were working in CangLin City at that time used to be refugees fleeing from the Western Region.",
  ["1001051001_56"]="Although it was already the past, one's longing for one's homeland is like subtle threads, usually hidden in the depths. As soon as memories are stirred, they resurface.",
  ["1001051001_57"]="Residents from the Western Region surrounded the station in a crowd so tight not even a single drop of water could seep through.",
  ["1001051001_58"]="I understood them. Although they couldn't take the train back to the homeland, the train would bring back the food they had cultivated. Soon, the children in the Western Region would have their tables filled with fragrant rice and steamed bun.",
  ["1001051001_59"]="I heard that the train also received a grand welcome when it reached the Western Region.",
  ["1001051001_6"]="Sometimes, he wonders whether it is the land, its people, or even the era itself that is sick.",
  ["1001051001_60"]="The people there wrote numerous thank-you letters to us, so many that they could have buried the entire office. Many of them were pencil and crayon drawings made by children.",
  ["1001051001_61"]="Those drawings were more beautiful than any artwork I had seen in my life.",
  ["1001051001_62"]="But I feel a sense of guilt, that we were too late. If only we had constructed the railroad earlier, if only we had grown rice earlier, if only we had anticipated the climate change earlier...",
  ["1001051001_63"]="Before this city was built and before that train departed, I often wondered...",
  ["1001051001_64"]="O, Bodhisattva, when will you finally bring your salvation to this land?",
  ["1001051001_65"]="It's ridiculous, right? When people are pushed to their limits, they always seek something ethereal to soothe their hearts.",
  ["1001051001_66"]="It was only after that train departed that I finally felt relieved and realized...",
  ["1001051001_67"]="Bodhisattva doesn't live in the sky at all. No wonder my countless prayers went unanswered.",
  ["1001051001_68"]="Humans... they have to become bodhisattvas themselves, to bring salvation to themselves and others.",
  ["1001051001_69"]="Later on, people spontaneously gathered on that day to celebrate every year, and at some point, the Bureau of Culture & Tourism officially named it the Harvest Festival.",
  ["1001051001_7"]="Tired, exhausted...",
  ["1001051001_70"]="I think it's a good thing.",
  ["1001051001_71"]="After all, it's the day when people realize that they themselves are bodhisattvas.",
  ["1001051001_72"]="It is late at night.",
  ["1001051001_73"]="Nong Ji has gone to bed. Zero and I exchange silent glances.",
  ["1001051001_74"]="After some amount of time has passed, I let out a sigh.",
  ["1001051001_75"]="I don't believe he's the culprit.",
  ["1001051001_76"]="...",
  ["1001051001_77"]="I have confidence in your judgment.",
  ["1001051001_8"]="However, he is unable to stop.",
  ["1001051001_9"]="Occasionally, he looks up at the red sun hanging far away in the eastern sky.",
  ["1001051101_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001051101_10"]="A few days ago, I brazenly requested to stay at Mr. Nong Ji's house.",
  ["1001051101_11"]="However, since then, I have not come across anyone other than Mr. Nong Ji, not even Wushi.",
  ["1001051101_12"]="The only unusual thing is that...",
  ["1001051101_13"]="The meals were incredibly delicious, and I gained several kilograms.",
  ["1001051101_14"]="...",
  ["1001051101_15"]="I'm glad you've been enjoying yourself.",
  ["1001051101_16"]="What about Xin? Connect me to her.",
  ["1001051101_2"]="Conspiracy",
  ["1001051101_3"]="Time flies by.",
  ["1001051101_4"]="The day of the Harvest Festival has arrived.",
  ["1001051101_5"]="Anything out of the ordinary?",
  ["1001051101_6"]="No, the surveillance system hasn't detected anything suspicious.",
  ["1001051101_7"]="It seems like Wushi has disappeared without a trace.",
  ["1001051101_8"]="What's the situation on your end, Head Librarian?",
  ["1001051101_9"]="Nothing suspicious, either.",
  ["1001051102_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001051102_10"]="However, at the moment, the square stands empty. To minimize the impact of the Cerulean Blight, the Harvest Festival will be broadcast to the residents instead.",
  ["1001051102_11"]="Behind the square, a beautiful and elegant building stands tall, surrounded by the urban area that blossoms in all directions like a lotus flower on the Fertile Plains.",
  ["1001051102_12"]="That is Nongsang Pavilion, the center and origin of CangLin City, a symbol of a bumper harvest.",
  ["1001051102_13"]="At the entrance of the square, a group of Cerulean beasts that appeared alongside Wushi now block Xin's path.",
  ["1001051102_14"]="All personnel, the target is temporarily lost.",
  ["1001051102_15"]="The last known location is the Central Square, in front of the main entrance of Nongsang Pavilion.",
  ["1001051102_16"]="All field personnel, disperse immediately and surround the Central Square. Block all roads and prevent the Cerulean beasts from escaping at all costs.",
  ["1001051102_17"]="Nongsang Pavilion? The square in front of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture? What's he doing there?",
  ["1001051102_18"]="Or a better question would be: What can only be done inside Nongsang Pavilion?",
  ["1001051102_19"]="Could it be related to the central agricultural system? That system is housed in the Nongsang Pavilion.",
  ["1001051102_2"]="Correction, the target has left the main road and is now moving on the rooftops! I'll stop updating the real-time location! Just follow my coordinates!",
  ["1001051102_20"]="The system manages and monitors all farmlands throughout the entire Fertile Plains.",
  ["1001051102_21"]="According to current regulations, any changes at the system level require a proposal from the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture and approval from the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity before implementation.",
  ["1001051102_22"]="As a result, any changes would require authorization from both Director Feng and myself.",
  ["1001051102_23"]="Since the contamination, we have deactivated the system, and it is currently disabled.",
  ["1001051102_24"]="What does he want to do with the system at a time like this?",
  ["1001051102_25"]="Wait... list all the main sub-functions of the system and see what could be used by Wushi.",
  ["1001051102_26"]="Sure thing. Main functions include seeding, pest control, sterilization, fertilization, sprinkling, conservation, ripening, harvesting, and husking...",
  ["1001051102_27"]="Wait, did you just say, \"sprinkling\"?",
  ["1001051102_28"]="Yeah, and not only that. The city's landscape maintenance devices are interconnected with the system.",
  ["1001051102_29"]="Overall, there are around 250,000 sprinklers distributed across the city's landscaped forests, parks, and greenbelts, all managed by the system.",
  ["1001051102_3"]="This is annoying! Why is he leaping around like a rabbit?!",
  ["1001051102_30"]="Qing and her colleague exchange a glance.",
  ["1001051102_31"]="I understand his plan now.",
  ["1001051102_32"]="If Wushi reactivates the sprinkler system during the Harvest Festival...",
  ["1001051102_33"]="Then the water from the Grandeur River will pour into CangLin City.",
  ["1001051102_34"]="Through the 250,000 sprinklers, the water will be dispersed into every corner of this city.",
  ["1001051102_35"]="In that case, every tree, flower, and lawn will become a source of the Cerulean Blight.",
  ["1001051102_36"]="The Cerulean Water will permeate the entire city.",
  ["1001051102_37"]="Subsequently, everyone will be transformed into immortal monsters.",
  ["1001051102_38"]="I must head to the City Hall now!",
  ["1001051102_4"]="Stop right there!",
  ["1001051102_5"]="The two soar above the uneven roofs like hawks.",
  ["1001051102_6"]="Before Xin's eyes, a vast open space expands.",
  ["1001051102_7"]="That is the Central Square.",
  ["1001051102_8"]="If it weren't for the Cerulean Blight, people preparing for the Harvest Festival would have gathered there.",
  ["1001051102_9"]="In previous years, as the official opening approached, the square would fill with crowds, flags, balloons, and smiling faces, creating a vibrant and colorful scene, much like the swaying flowers in the wilderness.",
  ["1001051201_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001051201_10"]="Greetings, citizens. I am Ji Lanqing, the Zhi Jing of the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity in this city.",
  ["1001051201_100"]="Regardless, I still hope I can be of some assistance, even if it's just a little.",
  ["1001051201_101"]="I won't press for details. I assume you've been instructed to keep them confidential, so I won't make things difficult for you.",
  ["1001051201_102"]="Here, take this.",
  ["1001051201_103"]="(He hands me a waist badge.)",
  ["1001051201_104"]="What's this?",
  ["1001051201_105"]="It's an authentication token for accessing the centralized agricultural system.",
  ["1001051201_106"]="The younger generation looks up to me and has entrusted me with this stuff.",
  ["1001051201_107"]="It's safe to say that this is the most important key in CangLin City.",
  ["1001051201_108"]="Although I'm not sure about your background, I know that you want to help the people here.",
  ["1001051201_109"]="Take it. The central agricultural system is the culmination of my life's work, and it will undoubtedly aid you in whatever endeavor you pursue.",
  ["1001051201_11"]="I apologize for interrupting your daily lives once again.",
  ["1001051201_110"]="Just as it has served this land over the years.",
  ["1001051201_111"]="Thank you, Mr. Nong.",
  ["1001051201_112"]="We'll accept it then.",
  ["1001051201_113"]="*cough* You're welcome.",
  ["1001051201_114"]="Now go, and good luck.",
  ["1001051201_12"]="Recently, we have been facing a challenging situation due to the contamination of the Grandeur River.",
  ["1001051201_13"]="In order to demonstrate our unwavering spirit and offer prayers for overcoming this challenge, the government has decided to advance the Harvest Festival.",
  ["1001051201_14"]="I fully understand the Festival's significance to CangLin City, to Jiangyin Region, and even to Qian, particularly in a difficult time like this.",
  ["1001051201_15"]="Therefore, I sincerely apologize to all of you once again.",
  ["1001051201_16"]="We have received reports that the sprinklers of the centralized agricultural system have been sabotaged.",
  ["1001051201_17"]="We believe that the saboteurs intend to activate the sprinkler system during the Harvest Festival today, causing the Grandeur River water to flood the city and infect all residents.",
  ["1001051201_18"]="Hence, we are compelled to immediately halt all scheduled activities and urge all citizens to leave public places, return home, and close all doors and windows.",
  ["1001051201_19"]="We have dispatched personnel to address the issue and apprehend the vandals.",
  ["1001051201_2"]="The Unveiled Truth",
  ["1001051201_20"]="We will make every effort to swiftly resolve the situation and restore normalcy to everyone's lives.",
  ["1001051201_21"]="Until further notice, I kindly request that you refrain from going outside, for the well-being and safety of your families.",
  ["1001051201_22"]="This concludes the broadcast.",
  ["1001051201_23"]="I can't believe something like this has happened.",
  ["1001051201_24"]="All directors... Wait, where's Director Feng? Why isn't he here?",
  ["1001051201_25"]="Feng Lin has been missing for the past few days. I have no idea what he has been up to, as he didn't request a leave or submit any reports.",
  ["1001051201_26"]="He probably couldn't stay in the office and went out to the field.",
  ["1001051201_27"]="...",
  ["1001051201_28"]="But why did he have to leave at such a critical moment?",
  ["1001051201_29"]="Well, never mind. We have more pressing matters to attend to.",
  ["1001051201_3"]="Secretary Qing, please wait! What are you intending to do?",
  ["1001051201_30"]="All directors, you have heard what I just said.",
  ["1001051201_31"]="The centralized agricultural system is under threat, so I need to know who else has direct access to the system.",
  ["1001051201_32"]="It seems like you already have a suspect in mind.",
  ["1001051201_33"]="Yes, but I don't have concrete evidence yet.",
  ["1001051201_34"]="I wonder whom you suspect?",
  ["1001051201_35"]="Well, Mr. Nong Ji is the former Director of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture. Perhaps he still has access to the central agricultural system?",
  ["1001051201_36"]="Huh? You don't know, Secretary Qing?",
  ["1001051201_37"]="Mr. Nong practically founded CangLin City, and the entire system was established during his tenure.",
  ["1001051201_38"]="Therefore, as a sign of respect, CangLin City has granted him the highest level of access to the system, allowing him to modify commands without any review.",
  ["1001051201_39"]="What?! This is the first time I've heard anything like this!",
  ["1001051201_4"]="As I mentioned, Director, the situation is urgent. I need you to activate the citywide broadcast immediately!",
  ["1001051201_40"]="That happened long ago before you joined the government. Mr. Nong has been retired for many years, after all.",
  ["1001051201_41"]="How can you all turn a blind eye to such a significant security breach?!",
  ["1001051201_42"]="But Secretary Qing, we're talking about Mr. Nong!",
  ["1001051201_43"]="He's the architect of this city!",
  ["1001051201_44"]="Moreover, retaining his access isn't a \"security breach\" at all. We've been relying on his expertise so far, and his authority facilitates his guidance in agricultural production and allows for timely corrections of any issues.",
  ["1001051201_45"]="For all these years, Mr. Nong has passionately dedicated himself to this city!",
  ["1001051201_46"]="Qing feels her mind trembling with this incredible revelation.",
  ["1001051201_47"]="...",
  ["1001051201_48"]="Please take a look at this photo.",
  ["1001051201_49"]="(Qing shows a photo of Wushi.)",
  ["1001051201_5"]="But this violates the regulations, Secretary Qing! You are the director of the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity, and you know that to activate the broadcast you need to submit a report to the municipal government and obtain permissions beforehand...",
  ["1001051201_50"]="Instruct the Bureau of Civil Security to apprehend this man. He's the one who directly sabotaged the centralized agricultural system.",
  ["1001051201_51"]="Wait, I think I've seen him before.",
  ["1001051201_52"]="You've seen him?",
  ["1001051201_53"]="Yeah, he looks familiar. Let me see... Oh, right! He's Director Feng's guard!",
  ["1001051201_54"]="Wait, Director Feng has a guard? I remember him refusing the guards assigned by the Bureau of Civil Security a long time ago.",
  ["1001051201_55"]="Oh, I remember that, too. It's customary for the director of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture to have a personal guard, but when Director Feng took office, he declined the offer.",
  ["1001051201_56"]="But that doesn't make sense. I met Director Feng and this young man in front of the hospital last year.",
  ["1001051201_57"]="They seemed to be quite familiar with each other, so I casually asked Director Feng if the young man was a relative of his, and he said that the man was his guard.",
  ["1001051201_58"]="Director Feng answered in such a lighthearted manner that I didn't think much of it at the time.",
  ["1001051201_59"]="Hmm? Why are you giving me that serious look, Secretary Qing?",
  ["1001051201_6"]="Now is not the time to adhere strictly to the regulations! If the government holds us responsible, I will take full responsibility! And if you have any grievances at that time, feel free to file a complaint, and I will not contest it!",
  ["1001051201_60"]="Everything makes sense now. Why didn't I... why didn't I suspect him earlier?!",
  ["1001051201_61"]="Nong Ji possesses supreme authority that does not require any approval. In other words, if Nong Ji were truly the culprit, Wushi would not need to take away Qing's waist badge.",
  ["1001051201_62"]="The proposals that needed review from the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity are the ones submitted by the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture!",
  ["1001051201_63"]="It's Feng Lin!!",
  ["1001051201_64"]="Wait... are you saying that... Feng Lin is the culprit behind this disaster?",
  ["1001051201_65"]="The Director of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture personally destroyed our agricultural production and intends to infect all the citizens with the Cerulean Blight?",
  ["1001051201_66"]="Should we arrest Feng Lin as well?",
  ["1001051201_67"]="We should, but I highly doubt we'll be able to catch him in CangLin City.",
  ["1001051201_68"]="I know his style. If all of this is truly his plan, he must have already prepared an exit strategy.",
  ["1001051201_69"]="Dammit! Who the heck is he?!",
  ["1001051201_7"]="I... alright! I'll do it!",
  ["1001051201_70"]="Can you hear me, Head Librarian?",
  ["1001051201_71"]="Please find an excuse to step away from Mr. Nong. I have important information to share with you.",
  ["1001051201_72"]="Please go ahead.",
  ["1001051201_73"]="Mr. Nong is in the courtyard now.",
  ["1001051201_74"]="I just left the City Hall, and the situation has become clear.",
  ["1001051201_75"]="Wushi is Feng Lin's follower, and Feng Lin is the one who has been trying to undermine CangLin City.",
  ["1001051201_76"]="F-Feng Lin, you say?",
  ["1001051201_77"]="The name instantly reminds me of the young man I encountered near the statue that day.",
  ["1001051201_78"]="Anyway, I genuinely hope that Qian will leave you with unforgettable memories, just as Obed left a lasting impression on me.",
  ["1001051201_79"]="His demeanor was gentle, and his smile was comforting, yet he is the one behind all of this?",
  ["1001051201_8"]="Broadcasting department, stand by. Increase transmitter power to the maximum and provide full band coverage! All other stations, suspend your programs! We will make an emergency announcement!",
  ["1001051201_80"]="The sudden turn of events has left me feeling overwhelmed.",
  ["1001051201_81"]="Please come to me immediately. We require all the assistance we can get.",
  ["1001051201_82"]="Sure.",
  ["1001051201_83"]="We're heading back now.",
  ["1001051201_84"]="As the call concludes, Nong Ji returns to the house and appears slightly surprised to see us preparing to depart.",
  ["1001051201_85"]="What's happening? Are you all leaving now?",
  ["1001051201_86"]="Yeah, something urgent just happened.",
  ["1001051201_87"]="There is a matter of concern within the city.",
  ["1001051201_88"]="I understand. These haven't been peaceful days.",
  ["1001051201_89"]="Feng Lin mentioned his intention to hold the Harvest Festival, but honestly, focusing on formalities seems inappropriate given the circumstances.",
  ["1001051201_9"]="All right, please proceed with your statement, Secretary Qing!",
  ["1001051201_90"]="Wait, you know Feng Lin?!",
  ["1001051201_91"]="Indeed, I do. How could I not be aware of my successor, the second director of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture?",
  ["1001051201_92"]="He used to visit me during his free time, accompanied by his young guard. Yeah, I'm talking about Wushi, the man who brought you to me that day.",
  ["1001051201_93"]="Life here can be boring, and they were the only ones who kept me company.",
  ["1001051201_94"]="But you know... they seemed preoccupied with something, and whenever I asked, they evaded the topic, treating me as if I were a child.",
  ["1001051201_95"]="...",
  ["1001051201_96"]="His words leave me speechless, unsure whether I should disclose the truth to the old man.",
  ["1001051201_97"]="Instead, he smiles, understanding my dilemma.",
  ["1001051201_98"]="Well, I'm old now, and I can't be of much help. All I can do is watch you young people running around, and it saddens me.",
  ["1001051201_99"]="Please don't think that way.",
  ["1001051301_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001051301_2"]="Pursuit — Part I",
  ["1001051301_3"]="Mr. Nong gave you his authentication token, you said?",
  ["1001051301_4"]="That's the first piece of good news we have received today.",
  ["1001051301_5"]="Please head to the Central Square and meet up with Xin. She's already there.",
  ["1001051301_6"]="I believe she is currently engaged in a tough battle. Please stop Wushi and foil Feng Lin's wicked plan!",
  ["1001051501_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001051501_10"]="But that's not practical at all. Master Yuanquan has taken a significant number of our members, and we are currently left with... let me count, one, two, three, four, five...",
  ["1001051501_100"]="It's my fault. I've forgotten the most powerful force within CangLin City.",
  ["1001051501_101"]="The number of closed valves is soaring now. So many residents have stepped out to close the valves in their neighborhoods!",
  ["1001051501_102"]="Looks like we will make it, Secretary Qing.",
  ["1001051501_103"]="More than 96% of all valves have been closed. Even if a few remain open, the damage won't be severe.",
  ["1001051501_104"]="Amazing!",
  ["1001051501_105"]="Qing! We've received an emergency communication! It's from the Head Librarian of Eme-an...",
  ["1001051501_106"]="Oh? Right! How's it going with Xin and the others? Did they manage to stop Wushi?!",
  ["1001051501_11"]="There's no need to count. I have just done so, and we have fewer than thirty people here, including myself.",
  ["1001051501_12"]="This means that each one of us will have to close nearly 10,000 valves on average...",
  ["1001051501_13"]="It would be easier for us to consume all the grain in the city.",
  ["1001051501_14"]="I know, and that's why I will return to the City Hall and mobilize all the staff there as well.",
  ["1001051501_15"]="However, even with that, it wouldn't be nearly enough. The entire government staff is just a small number, and we must also consider the members who are outside or elsewhere...",
  ["1001051501_16"]="Let's not forget our philosophy of practicality. If there is no better solution, then this is the path we must take.",
  ["1001051501_17"]="Understood. I will download a detailed map of the pipe network and distribute it to everyone's personal terminals.",
  ["1001051501_18"]="I will assign regions to each person for responsibility.",
  ["1001051501_19"]="And I'll will coordinate communications for each zone.",
  ["1001051501_2"]="United We Stand",
  ["1001051501_20"]="Everyone else, let's leave immediately and take action!",
  ["1001051501_21"]="So, this is what happened.",
  ["1001051501_22"]="My colleagues, please stop what you are doing now and turn off all the sprinkler valves.",
  ["1001051501_23"]="Mobilize all the police, fire, emergency rescue, and other disaster relief forces.",
  ["1001051501_24"]="How much time do we have left?",
  ["1001051501_25"]="The culprit plans to activate the sprinklers during the Harvest Festival, so we can assume the sprinklers will be activated the moment the Festival starts.",
  ["1001051501_26"]="Therefore, we have less than three hours.",
  ["1001051501_27"]="Closing 250,000 valves within three hours. This is totally impossible.",
  ["1001051501_28"]="So, we're supposed to close more than 80,000 valves per hour, around 14,000 per minute... 23 per second. Even a child knows these numbers are daunting!",
  ["1001051501_29"]="I understand, but every second we spend complaining about the difficulty, the danger gets that much closer to the people of CangLin City.",
  ["1001051501_3"]="Everyone, the Head Librarian of Eme-an and others are heading to the Central Square to meet up with Xin.",
  ["1001051501_30"]="Hey, we never said we wouldn't help, Secretary Qing.",
  ["1001051501_31"]="Have we ever turned a blind eye to our colleagues in distress and people in danger?",
  ["1001051501_32"]="We'll immediately notify all the staff to start now.",
  ["1001051501_33"]="We will clear the streets to ensure smooth traffic flow.",
  ["1001051501_34"]="Well, we will mobilize transportation forces to carry out the task.",
  ["1001051501_35"]="We'll dispatch personnel familiar with the pipeline layout in each district as guides.",
  ["1001051501_36"]="And we'll ceaselessly broadcast emergency announcements and request residents' cooperation.",
  ["1001051501_37"]="All hospitals throughout the city are already operating at near-full capacity, but we will find a way to distribute extra medical resources to deal with this crisis.",
  ["1001051501_38"]="If you require any funds, feel free to use them, and we will handle the accounting after the crisis.",
  ["1001051501_39"]="...",
  ["1001051501_4"]="At this moment, all our most elite members have gathered there.",
  ["1001051501_40"]="I sincerely thank you all.",
  ["1001051501_41"]="You can thank us after everything settles down.",
  ["1001051501_42"]="Secretary Qing, I have always wanted to tell you that while you are the backbone of the government, let's not forget that the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity is not the only department here.",
  ["1001051501_43"]="We might not be as capable as you, our judgment may not be as sharp, and we may seem old-fashioned and stubborn.",
  ["1001051501_44"]="However, we are also an integral part of this city, just like you, and the people of CangLin City rely on us.",
  ["1001051501_45"]="Let's work together.",
  ["1001051501_46"]="As a sage once said, \"Do it despite the insurmountable odds. Pour your heart and soul, undeterred by skepticism.\"",
  ["1001051501_47"]="A leader of WeiShi once said, \"We WeiShi seek nothing but the truth. We offer our utmost in every endeavor so we won't have shame or regrets.\"",
  ["1001051501_48"]="What's the situation on Secretary Qing's end?",
  ["1001051501_49"]="Based on the feedback from our squads, the situation is far from optimistic, to say the least.",
  ["1001051501_5"]="But even so, we must not remain idle. We will execute the backup plan.",
  ["1001051501_50"]="Time is running out.",
  ["1001051501_51"]="We're responsible for the maintenance of the pipelines, and we understand how challenging this task is.",
  ["1001051501_52"]="I don't mean to discourage you at this critical moment, but seriously, there's no way to turn off all the sprinklers within three hours without a miracle.",
  ["1001051501_53"]="In the Spring Equinox Neighborhood.",
  ["1001051501_54"]="Hello, Equinox Neighborhood Service Center. How can I help you today?",
  ["1001051501_55"]="Oh, everything's cool. Just wanted to know what's going on outside. Why are there so many cop cars and fire trucks zooming around?",
  ["1001051501_56"]="Sorry, but we're not sure either. Our superiors haven't given us any info... Hold up, got another call coming in!",
  ["1001051501_57"]="Hello, how can I help you?",
  ["1001051501_58"]="I saw like five or six dudes messing with the sprinklers on the street. Are they up to some sabotage or what? The government said someone was gonna attack the central agricultural system, right?",
  ["1001051501_59"]="We'll pass this info to our superiors. Oh, just wait a sec...",
  ["1001051501_6"]="In case the system fails, we have manual switches for all the sprinklers.",
  ["1001051501_60"]="Understood. We'll spread the words immediately.",
  ["1001051501_61"]="In the Spring Equinox Neighborhood Group.",
  ["1001051501_62"]="Thanks for all the reports, folks. Our superiors confirmed that those workers are from the government. They are just shutting off the sprinkler valves, so no need to worry.",
  ["1001051501_63"]="Are those workers under my place too? But the Spring Equinox Road is like ten miles long!",
  ["1001051501_64"]="They ain't seriously gonna turn off all the valves, right? I mean, that's impossible, don't you think?",
  ["1001051501_65"]="Come on, think about it! Why would they do that if they had any other options? Something must've seriously messed up the central agricultural system!",
  ["1001051501_66"]="So, are we just gonna sit here and do nothing?",
  ["1001051501_67"]="Well, what's your suggestion then?",
  ["1001051501_68"]="[Forum]",
  ["1001051501_69"]="Hey, does anyone know how many valves are there in this city?",
  ["1001051501_7"]="We must manually close all the valves for the sprinklers in the city. By doing so, even if the system reactivates the sprinklers, contaminated water will not be sprayed out.",
  ["1001051501_70"]="I've worked on municipal systems. While I don't have the exact count, I reckon there's gotta be at least a couple hundred thousand!",
  ["1001051501_71"]="How many people they got in the government?",
  ["1001051501_72"]="Like, two or three thousand, tops. When I spoke to them at the Bureau of Health & Welfare, it was clear they don't have enough manpower.",
  ["1001051501_73"]="So basically, they can't close all the valves themselves!",
  ["1001051501_74"]="In the Summer Solstice Neighborhood Group.",
  ["1001051501_75"]="I'm freaking out watching from upstairs. Let's just go down and lend a hand!",
  ["1001051501_76"]="But the government told us not to leave our homes...",
  ["1001051501_77"]="Then you can stay cooped up at home all you want! I bet your barbecue biz will thrive when the contaminated water sprays all over the city!",
  ["1001051501_78"]="I agree. If we help them now, all we need to do is close the valves, but if they fail, we'll have to hold our breath!",
  ["1001051501_79"]="Whatever, I'm heading down.",
  ["1001051501_8"]="Wait, we are supposed to manually close all the valves? Each and every one of them?!",
  ["1001051501_80"]="I'm already down here helping them shut off the valves. They're grateful for the assistance, and it's clear they're short-staffed. Do you really think they care if we go out or not? Just join us and lend a hand!",
  ["1001051501_81"]="In the Spring Equinox Neighborhood Group.",
  ["1001051501_82"]="Just contacted all residents of Building No. 5, and everyone has agreed to help shut off the valves.",
  ["1001051501_83"]="Building No. 15 is in on it, too.",
  ["1001051501_84"]="Count us in, Building No. 9.",
  ["1001051501_85"]="And Building No. 21 is on board, too.",
  ["1001051501_86"]="We're heading out now. Anyone who wants to join us, come along.",
  ["1001051501_87"]="In the Grain Rain Neighborhood Group.",
  ["1001051501_88"]="I'm not staying put. I'm heading downstairs.",
  ["1001051501_89"]="Count me in, too. If anyone wants to tag along, just let me know, and we'll team up.",
  ["1001051501_9"]="I have conducted a check of the municipal pipe network, and it shows that there are approximately 250,000 valves in the city.",
  ["1001051501_90"]="Hey, where's the dude who said he worked in municipal construction? Show us the valve blueprints and teach us how to shut them off!",

  ["1001051602_11"]="Seeing that Wushi has ceased his attacks, the red-haired girl quickly changes her direction and retreats towards Nongsang Pavilion.",
  ["1001051602_12"]="You're Tiaohua's brother, right?",
  ["1001051602_13"]="Convinced that Wushi no longer poses a threat, Xin puts away her lance.",

  ["1001051602_2"]="Xin attempts a fatal blow with her lance, but it is halted midway by Wushi's bear companion.",

  ["1001051602_24"]="So, this is it?",
  ["1001051602_25"]="If you are referring to authorization, yes, it is complete.",
  ["1001051602_26"]="Tell us where to change the system settings!",
  ["1001051602_27"]="It seems this is your first visit here. This centralized agricultural system has long abandoned traditional methods of interaction.",
  ["1001051602_28"]="While I can understand most verbal commands, if you prefer the traditional input method, I can guide you to the console.",
  ["1001051602_29"]="No need! Just deactivate all sprinklers in the city!",
  ["1001051602_3"]="In that moment, the lance pierces through the only part of the giant bear's neck not covered in bronze.",
  ["1001051602_30"]="Failed to execute the command. All sprinklers have been deactivated since Director Feng Lin and Secretary Qing adjusted the system settings last time. No commands have been issued to reactivate them.",
  ["1001051602_31"]="No one has reactivated them, you say? Are you sure about that?",
  ["1001051602_32"]="Affirmative. All 252,017 valves in the city are closed. Would you like to modify the configuration to reactivate them?",
  ["1001051602_33"]="However, 250,039 of those valves have been manually closed. The manual lockout must be lifted before the system can assume control.",
  ["1001051602_34"]="N-no, that's not necessary! Just leave them closed as they are.",
  ["1001051602_35"]="Understood. The sprinkler subsystem will remain on standby.",
  ["1001051602_36"]="Zero and I exchange a glance.",
  ["1001051602_37"]="Wushi has not activated the sprinkler system at all.",
  ["1001051602_38"]="I instinctively gaze at the sky outside the window.",
  ["1001051602_39"]="Although it is still midday, the sky has dimmed to an almost nighttime hue. Thick clusters of clouds conceal the sun, pressing down heavily.",
  ["1001051602_4"]="The giant bear thuds to the ground. Wushi freezes, staring blankly at his fallen companion.",
  ["1001051602_40"]="At that moment, I suddenly realize why Wushi displayed no signs of panic when Zero and I approached Nongsang Pavilion.",
  ["1001051602_41"]="Simultaneously, I finally grasp a situation even more dire than the activation of the citywide sprinklers.",
  ["1001051602_42"]="Now I finally get it...",
  ["1001051602_43"]="We must contact Qing immediately.",

  ["1001051602_45"]="Oh? Right! How is it going with Xin and the others? Have they managed to stop Wushi?!",
  ["1001051602_46"]="They asked me to inform you that Wushi didn't activate the sprinkler system at all!",
  ["1001051602_47"]="What did you say? Then what was the purpose of all this?!",
  ["1001051602_48"]="And the Head Librarian said that all residents of the city must go back home immediately...",
  ["1001051602_49"]="Wushi does not pursue them.",
  ["1001051602_5"]="Now! Go!",
  ["1001051602_50"]="He casts his gaze downward towards the giant bear lying beside him.",
  ["1001051602_51"]="The heavily injured bear struggles on the ground, attempting to rise, blood gushing from its throat.",
  ["1001051602_52"]="Wushi squats beside it, gently patting the back of its neck, comforting his only friend.",
  ["1001051602_53"]="Take a break, Pi.",
  ["1001051602_54"]="In response to his touch, the giant bear emitted a low, plaintive whimper resembling a bear cub.",
  ["1001051602_55"]="...",
  ["1001051602_56"]="Master... I don't know if I'm doing the right thing or not.",
  ["1001051602_57"]="Follow my heart, right?",
  ["1001051602_58"]="Clearly, he cherishes his sister deeply, and he desperately wishes to prevent her from leaving...",
  ["1001051602_59"]="However, he hesitated, both in terms of the strangers and the city itself.",
  ["1001051602_6"]="Seizing the opportunity, Zero pulls me along, and we rush towards Nongsang Pavilion from the side.",
  ["1001051602_60"]="Raindrop Effect",
  ["1001051602_61"]="At that moment, Pi ceases whimpering, and Wushi gazes upward as if he is sensing something.",
  ["1001051602_62"]="Several raindrops abruptly land on his face and into Pi's mouth.",
  ["1001051602_63"]="...",
  ["1001051602_64"]="He closes his eyes.",
  ["1001051602_65"]="If only this rain could fall in that spring over ten years ago...",
  ["1001051602_66"]="How wonderful it would have been...",
  ["1001051602_7"]="Before entering the pavilion, I instinctively glance back at Wushi and Xin, who are still facing each other.",
  ["1001051602_8"]="Wushi also happens to look back at us.",
  ["1001051602_9"]="Our eyes meet for a split second before parting. His calm gaze, like the sky hidden behind layers of clouds, reveals no glimmer of light.",
  ["1001051701_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001051701_10"]="Fortunately, we still have this wine.",
  ["1001051701_100"]="Sure, what's her name?",
  ["1001051701_101"]="Tiaohua. Her name is Tiaohua.",
  ["1001051701_102"]="And yours?",
  ["1001051701_103"]="The boy pondered for a moment.",
  ["1001051701_104"]="Wushi... My name is Wushi.",
  ["1001051701_11"]="His father gently ran his hand over the jar, his expression softening.",
  ["1001051701_12"]="For a brief moment, it seemed as though his father was not caressing a wine jar, but rather the girl who had left home long ago.",
  ["1001051701_13"]="His eyes were tender and gentle, momentarily causing the boy to forget the hardships he had endured over the years, as if he had traveled back to the day they had buried the jar several years earlier.",
  ["1001051701_14"]="Good wine, like good food, can satisfy your hunger. Tell you mom to prepare some bowls.",
  ["1001051701_15"]="...",
  ["1001051701_16"]="Upon hearing that they still had a jar of wine, his mother's face lit up with joy.",
  ["1001051701_17"]="Yes, thankfully, we still have this jar of wine.",
  ["1001051701_18"]="Go and fetch some bowls.",
  ["1001051701_19"]="His mother affectionately touched his head and spoke in a gentle voice.",
  ["1001051701_2"]="Wushi — Part III",
  ["1001051701_20"]="It had been quite a while since she had such a radiant smile on her face, not since Tiaohua had left.",
  ["1001051701_21"]="The boy drifted off for a moment, not noticing the grim determination that flicked in his mother's eyes.",
  ["1001051701_22"]="His father walked over to the table, holding the partially opened jar of Maiden Rose, and poured a bowl for himself and one for his mother.",
  ["1001051701_23"]="Are we all ready?",
  ["1001051701_24"]="We are.",
  ["1001051701_25"]="The two exchanged a glance and smiled, but the boy felt a bit confused.",
  ["1001051701_26"]="At that moment, a sudden knock echoed at the door.",
  ["1001051701_27"]="Instinctively, he wanted to run towards the cellar, but his mother gently pulled him back.",
  ["1001051701_28"]="His father went to the door, holding his pitchfork.",
  ["1001051701_29"]="Outside the door stood a traveler. Unlike the strangers they had encountered before, he appeared travel-weary but maintained a polite demeanor.",
  ["1001051701_3"]="Like sand slipping through his fingers, the day arrived when the rice vat finally emptied.",
  ["1001051701_30"]="Excuse me, do you have any food to spare for this weary traveler from afar? I'm willing to pay for it.",
  ["1001051701_31"]="Asking such a question in a place like this felt like the cruelest joke.",
  ["1001051701_32"]="However, the traveler's demeanor seemed genuine. His father shook his head and opened the gate, allowing the stranger to see the empty courtyard.",
  ["1001051701_33"]="I see, an unabandoned house is already a rare sight here in the Western Region. Wait, is that...?",
  ["1001051701_34"]="This aroma... could it be the Maiden Rose from Jiangyin Region?",
  ["1001051701_35"]="His father shook his head, his grip on the pitchfork tightening.",
  ["1001051701_36"]="...",
  ["1001051701_37"]="That's the last of the wine, and I need to let my boy taste it. I'm sorry, but I can't share it with you.",
  ["1001051701_38"]="I understand.",
  ["1001051701_39"]="The traveler's gaze casually shifted to the boy.",
  ["1001051701_4"]="Unexpectedly, his father offered a rare smile and beckoned him to the yard beneath the withered tree, where they began to dig into the soil together.",
  ["1001051701_40"]="His stare seemed to come from a distant place, piercing like an arrow.",
  ["1001051701_41"]="Under that gaze, the boy felt exposed and vulnerable, as if he were a baby.",
  ["1001051701_42"]="Fortunately, the traveler quickly averted his gaze.",
  ["1001051701_43"]="It has a delightful aroma. I believe it's been reserved for three years, or perhaps five at most.",
  ["1001051701_44"]="Unfortunately, Maiden Rose only reveals its true essence after aging for eighteen years or more.",
  ["1001051701_45"]="Now, please allow me to take my leave.",
  ["1001051701_46"]="When his father returned to the table and sat down, shouts and footsteps echoed again from outside the door.",
  ["1001051701_47"]="Those were the sounds the boy had heard countless times when waking up in the middle of the night, always accompanied by a nightmare he could never forget.",
  ["1001051701_48"]="This time, his father did not respond. However, after a few moments, a group of strangers burst through the doorway.",
  ["1001051701_49"]="Hey, what's that amazing smell?! This old fool's got something really good!",
  ["1001051701_5"]="Soon, a jar was unearthed.",
  ["1001051701_50"]="Where is it? Let's go find it!",
  ["1001051701_51"]="Are you blind? It's right there on the table!",
  ["1001051701_52"]="Hey, old fool, we've come here multiple times, but it seems like you don't trust us at all.",
  ["1001051701_53"]="You know, as parents, you should set a good example of honesty for your children.",
  ["1001051701_54"]="It's not right to enjoy such fantastic wine all by yourself, ya know?",
  ["1001051701_55"]="His mother tried to step in, but she was forcefully pushed away, accidentally hitting her forehead on the corner of a side table, and then lay motionless.",
  ["1001051701_56"]="His father let out a desperate roar and lunged forward.",
  ["1001051701_57"]="The strangers raised their knives in self-defense, and that was how his father collided with the sharp edge.",
  ["1001051701_58"]="Tsk! What bad luck!",
  ["1001051701_59"]="Good news is the wine's still here!",
  ["1001051701_6"]="It held the huangjiu produced in Jiangyin Region, a fine brew made from fermented brown sugar and glutinous rice.",
  ["1001051701_60"]="What about the boy?",
  ["1001051701_61"]="We'll deal with him later. Let's enjoy the wine for now!",
  ["1001051701_62"]="He stared at the strangers, who were engrossed in their indulgence, with a vague sense of something amiss but lacking complete comprehension of the situation. His mind was clouded, drifting in an unknown and hazy realm.",
  ["1001051701_63"]="Then he saw the strangers losing their grip. The bowls in their hands slipped and shattered on the ground.",
  ["1001051701_64"]="The strangers clutched their throats, their bodies convulsing, unable to utter a complete sentence.",
  ["1001051701_65"]="A few breaths later, the strangers collapsed to the ground, as motionless as stone statues, their lifeless eyes fixed upon the cold bodies of the boy's parents.",
  ["1001051701_66"]="In that moment, the haze enveloping his mind began to dissipate.",
  ["1001051701_67"]="Everything had been shattered.",
  ["1001051701_68"]="Are we all ready?",
  ["1001051701_69"]="We are.",
  ["1001051701_7"]="It was the Maiden Rose exchanged for a calf a few years ago.",
  ["1001051701_70"]="So... that was the truth.",
  ["1001051701_71"]="The best wishes had turned into deadly poison.",
  ["1001051701_72"]="With weary legs, the boy stumbled toward the table and picked up his untouched small bowl.",
  ["1001051701_73"]="The jar was nearly empty, but he managed to hold it with great effort.",
  ["1001051701_74"]="He climbed onto the stool, raised the jar high, and poured himself one final serving.",
  ["1001051701_75"]="His tears mingled with the wine as they fell into the bowl.",
  ["1001051701_76"]="Just then, he heard footsteps from behind.",
  ["1001051701_77"]="He turned around to find that the traveler with the enigmatic gaze had somehow returned.",
  ["1001051701_78"]="The traveler surveyed the room in silence, eventually focusing his attention on the bowl in the boy's hand.",
  ["1001051701_79"]="Wine is intended for adults. You're not yet ready to appreciate its taste.",
  ["1001051701_8"]="He had never eaten glutinous rice or tasted brown sugar, so he didn't understand the purpose of digging it up now.",
  ["1001051701_80"]="Maiden Rose is rarely found in the Western Region, and giving it to a child would only spoil its essence.",
  ["1001051701_81"]="Unperturbed by the lifeless bodies, the traveler approached the boy.",
  ["1001051701_82"]="With a gentle yet resolute hand, he took the bowl of wine from the boy.",
  ["1001051701_83"]="Then, he closed his eyes and consumed it all in one swift motion.",
  ["1001051701_84"]="The boy looked up at the traveler, counting the beats of his heart.",
  ["1001051701_85"]="However, after a long time, the traveler slowly opened his eyes and released a contented sigh.",
  ["1001051701_86"]="It's indeed a fine wine, though it's regrettable that there's so little of it. Old friends always depart, running water eventually passes away, and good wine is never ample enough.",
  ["1001051701_87"]="I'm sorry. I just drank the last bit of wine without the host's permission.",
  ["1001051701_88"]="For such fine wine, I should offer something in return. Since you probably don't know what money is, I'll fulfill one of your wishes as payment for the wine.",
  ["1001051701_89"]="He gazed into the traveler's eyes, which resembled deep pools of water undisturbed by ripples.",
  ["1001051701_9"]="However, a sense of relief appeared on his father's face, almost like a smile.",
  ["1001051701_90"]="Can I ask for anything?",
  ["1001051701_91"]="The traveler looked around and showed an awkward expression.",
  ["1001051701_92"]="Well... I guess I was a bit drunk and boasted a little too much. Seriously, how can an adult say something impossible in front of a child?",
  ["1001051701_93"]="I can't bring the dead back or make the sun come out of the west, but as long as it can be achieved with human power, feel free to ask.",
  ["1001051701_94"]="Behind the traveler, the door to his \"home\" stood open, and the two planks swung in the wind, resembling the wings of a dying moth.",
  ["1001051701_95"]="Please take me away.",
  ["1001051701_96"]="Take you away? To where?",
  ["1001051701_97"]="To where...?",
  ["1001051701_98"]="...",
  ["1001051701_99"]="Anywhere will do. I want to... find my sister.",
  ["1001051801_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001051801_10"]="Master... if I'm too incompetent... to fulfill your wishes...",
  ["1001051801_100"]="Sprouting from the soil are clusters of rice seedlings.",
  ["1001051801_101"]="Cultivate with moon soil, experimental variety No. 1.",
  ["1001051801_102"]="Well...",
  ["1001051801_103"]="A sigh escapes as numerous memories and thoughts resurface one after another.",
  ["1001051801_104"]="He had so many chapters of life and so many names.",
  ["1001051801_105"]="Wushi calls him Master. The CangLin municipal government refers to him as Feng Lin. Nemesis recognizes him as the Sower...",
  ["1001051801_106"]="And the people of Qian reveres him as...",
  ["1001051801_107"]="The ancestor of agriculture and the First Emperor of Qian...",
  ["1001051801_108"]="Ji Xia.",
  ["1001051801_109"]="So, autumn comes in the end.",
  ["1001051801_11"]="No need to worry, Wushi.",
  ["1001051801_12"]="Whether you succeed or fail, the outcome will not change.",
  ["1001051801_13"]="By embracing tranquility and forsaking greed, the natural order unfolds, allowing the world to find its balance.",
  ["1001051801_14"]="I love all the people of Qian deeply, and I'm confident that they won't let me down.",
  ["1001051801_15"]="It is because of the virtuous nature of this generation that I'm confident they will join me in establishing an eternal paradise.",
  ["1001051801_16"]="Heavy rain pours down.",
  ["1001051801_17"]="The rain, which has been accumulating above CangLin City for an entire month, is now pouring down relentlessly.",
  ["1001051801_18"]="All citizens on the streets look up to the sky in unison as if they have sensed something unusual.",
  ["1001051801_19"]="No one realizes the impending impact of this rain, except for Qing.",
  ["1001051801_2"]="Feng Lin",
  ["1001051801_20"]="Ahhh... ahhh... why... why is this...",
  ["1001051801_21"]="Qing feebly raises her hand and catches a droplet of rain.",
  ["1001051801_22"]="Why is this happening?",
  ["1001051801_23"]="The Cerulean hue of the rain fills her with despair.",
  ["1001051801_24"]="Why didn't I noticed that earlier?",
  ["1001051801_25"]="The river water turns into clouds and then into rain that falls on the earth.",
  ["1001051801_26"]="The ceaseless Cerulean rain is now nourishing the entire city.",
  ["1001051801_27"]="Nature treats all lives between heaven and earth with equal compassion and fairness.",
  ["1001051801_28"]="He experiences a very long dream.",
  ["1001051801_29"]="The clouds are rippling amidst the gentle breeze.",
  ["1001051801_3"]="A few days ago.",
  ["1001051801_30"]="He stands on the ridge of a field, facing an endless expanse of green.",
  ["1001051801_31"]="The seedlings have just been planted and barely reach his calves.",
  ["1001051801_32"]="Stepping into the field, he bows down and tenderly caresses the delicate seedlings, as if they were his own children.",
  ["1001051801_33"]="Grow up healthy.",
  ["1001051801_34"]="He murmurs softly.",
  ["1001051801_35"]="As if in response to his words, a gentle breeze sways the seedlings.",
  ["1001051801_36"]="He raises his eyes, observing the growing waves of rice. At that moment, he suddenly recalls the purpose of his presence.",
  ["1001051801_37"]="Before his mind can fully process it, his body instinctively springs into action.",
  ["1001051801_38"]="His legs, seemingly independent of his will, carry him forward as he chases after the surging waves of rice.",
  ["1001051801_39"]="How could he have forgotten this?",
  ["1001051801_4"]="I have other matters to attend to, and we won't be seeing each other again in the near future. As for the remaining matters in CangLin City, I entrust them to you.",
  ["1001051801_40"]="The waves of rice have been the pursuit of his entire life.",
  ["1001051801_41"]="A human's life can be as fleeting as dew evaporating in the morning sun.",
  ["1001051801_42"]="The faster he runs, the taller the surrounding seedlings grow.",
  ["1001051801_43"]="He finds himself surrounded by a vibrant green sea of rice, until he is completely immersed within it.",
  ["1001051801_44"]="The rice matures, while his vitality diminishes, leaving him with a frail body resembling a withered tree.",
  ["1001051801_45"]="However, the seedlings remain strong, propelling him forward. The older he becomes, the taller the rice grows.",
  ["1001051801_46"]="When the rice reaches the height of sorghum, with stalks as thick as broomsticks and grains clustered like grapes...",
  ["1001051801_47"]="He stoops down, realizing that he can no longer walk.",
  ["1001051801_48"]="As he comes to a stop, the waves of rice cease their surging.",
  ["1001051801_49"]="This time, the waves do not crash forward but gather around him.",
  ["1001051801_5"]="The remaining matters?",
  ["1001051801_50"]="Slowly, he sits down, leaning against the towering rice.",
  ["1001051801_51"]="He understands that if he were to fall into a deep sleep within his dream, he would never awaken again.",
  ["1001051801_52"]="The breeze gently rustles the waves of rice, filling the air with a fragrant aroma. He believes that this time, he can finally embrace a long sleep without any regrets.",
  ["1001051801_53"]="Thus, he closes his eyes.",
  ["1001051801_54"]="...",
  ["1001051801_55"]="The sound of a toddler's sobbing echoes in his ears.",
  ["1001051801_56"]="In an instant, he awakens from the dream.",
  ["1001051801_57"]="A refreshing breeze flows in through the window.",
  ["1001051801_58"]="As Nong Ji turns his head, he sees a familiar young face reflected in his eyes.",
  ["1001051801_59"]="He wants to greet the young man as he always did, but his throat feels dry and hoarse, rendering him speechless.",
  ["1001051801_6"]="You have your own path, Wushi. Follow your heart, and everything will be fine.",
  ["1001051801_60"]="The young man brings a glass of water to his lips.",
  ["1001051801_61"]="Nong Ji glances at the glass of water and shakes his head. The young man does not insist and places the glass back on the bedside table.",
  ["1001051801_62"]="I had a dream.",
  ["1001051801_63"]="Was it a pleasant dream?",
  ["1001051801_64"]="I suppose so... yes, it was a pleasant dream.",
  ["1001051801_65"]="But your expression doesn't look peaceful.",
  ["1001051801_66"]="It's difficult to find peace when you still have unfinished tasks and experiments. Besides...",
  ["1001051801_67"]="Despite his old age, he displays an expression of anxiety akin to a helpless child.",
  ["1001051801_68"]="I heard the cries of children...",
  ["1001051801_69"]="I'm terrified. I'm worried that those children won't have enough to eat...",
  ["1001051801_7"]="Wushi remains silent for a while before nodding slightly.",
  ["1001051801_70"]="What if they get hungry or get sick?",
  ["1001051801_71"]="When I think of these concerns, I can't find peace in my dream.",
  ["1001051801_72"]="The young man places a comforting hand on his shoulder and gently pats it, as if soothing a child, whispering softly.",
  ["1001051801_73"]="It's alright. It was just a bad dream.",
  ["1001051801_74"]="My lifelong pursuit has been to ensure that no one grows hungry.",
  ["1001051801_75"]="I wonder if I have done... well enough.",
  ["1001051801_76"]="You don't have to sleep if you're terrified.",
  ["1001051801_77"]="However, Nong Ji shakes his head.",
  ["1001051801_78"]="One should be like a good seed, growing deep roots and abundant branches...",
  ["1001051801_79"]="But all tangible things have their inevitable fate. Rice will become food for people, and straw will turn into fertile soil for the coming year.",
  ["1001051801_8"]="As you wish, Master.",
  ["1001051801_80"]="Only then will a seed not be in vain.",
  ["1001051801_81"]="The young man lets out a gentle sigh.",
  ["1001051801_82"]="Well... sleep, then.",
  ["1001051801_83"]="You've done excellently. No one could have done better than you.",
  ["1001051801_84"]="No one will ever go hungry or fall ill again. I promise you.",
  ["1001051801_85"]="Rest well and have a peaceful dream.",
  ["1001051801_86"]="That gentle yet resolute voice dispels all the echoing cries that have lingered around his ears.",
  ["1001051801_87"]="Nong Ji closes his eyes once more.",
  ["1001051801_88"]="In a trance, the nurturing and benevolent earth once again unfolds before his eyes.",
  ["1001051801_89"]="It opens its arms, welcoming him.",
  ["1001051801_9"]="The young man was about to leave, but then he came back.",
  ["1001051801_90"]="This time, he runs into its embrace and never looks back.",
  ["1001051801_91"]="...",
  ["1001051801_92"]="The young man stands up, taking a moment to straighten the deceased old man's hair and affectionately rubs his weathered face.",
  ["1001051801_93"]="Life a father caressing his most cherished child.",
  ["1001051801_94"]="Sweet dreams.",
  ["1001051801_95"]="At that moment, a hint of rice fragrance wafts into the house.",
  ["1001051801_96"]="The young man's face shows a hint of surprise.",
  ["1001051801_97"]="Following the aroma of rice, he approaches the window.",
  ["1001051801_98"]="Outside the window, the rain has ceased. The autumn sun bathes everything in its glow, and the golden wind whispers softly.",
  ["1001051801_99"]="In front of the window, a small laboratory shelters a mound of fresh soil from the Cerulean rain.",
  ["1001060101_1"]="Grandeur River",
  ["1001060101_10"]="Beneath the clear water, smooth pebbles are faintly veiled in green, resembling moss but subtly different.",
  ["1001060101_100"]="Another unfamiliar sight.",
  ["1001060101_101"]="This arduous journey has spanned thousands of miles.",
  ["1001060101_102"]="He has witnessed numerous mountains, rivers, birds, beasts, plants, and landscapes unseen by prior generations.",
  ["1001060101_103"]="...Yet, he no longer experiences the same excitement and delight as he once did upon encountering new wonders.",
  ["1001060101_104"]="Birds migrate southward with the changing seasons.",
  ["1001060101_105"]="Rivers flow towards the sea.",
  ["1001060101_106"]="Somewhere, someday, his lengthy expedition will reach its conclusion.",
  ["1001060101_107"]="Where might that conclusion be?",
  ["1001060101_108"]="Cang Luo's voice interrupts his thoughts.",
  ["1001060101_109"]="That mountain is known as \"Snow Mountain\" by the clans who recently surrendered. They say there's an impasse beneath it.",
  ["1001060101_11"]="The youth offers a gentle greeting to the little turtle.",
  ["1001060101_110"]="Those who ventured near the mountain never came back. The \"owner\" there doesn't seem too keen on uninvited guests.",
  ["1001060101_111"]="Well, it's pretty absurd that several clans have recently joined us, with tens of thousands of people, but not a single one of them is willing to guide us through this mountain range.",
  ["1001060101_112"]="I wonder what kind of threat is daunting them?",
  ["1001060101_113"]="Speaking of which, Chieftain... Should we halt our advance and send our messengers?",
  ["1001060101_114"]="No, not needed.",
  ["1001060101_115"]="Our opposition doesn't seem keen on talking it out. Sending messengers would just be a waste of time.",
  ["1001060101_116"]="We've journeyed over two thousand miles already. All this vast land is under our control, and we have the advantage in numbers.",
  ["1001060101_117"]="Even the snowy mountains and the impasse won't stop us.",
  ["1001060101_118"]="As the sun dips below the horizon, the path begins to incline steeply.",
  ["1001060101_12"]="Hey there, little one.",
  ["1001060101_120"]="The snow mountain is glowing red. Looks like a fire lighting up the sky.",
  ["1001060101_121"]="Fire attracts moths. Let's hope the moths drawn here aren't too troublesome.",
  ["1001060101_122"]="Well, we're on our opponent's territory, Chieftain. We might just be the moths in their eyes.",
  ["1001060101_123"]="Haha, you know, there's nothing wrong with moths being drawn to flames.",
  ["1001060101_124"]="To a moth, that flame could be the brightest light it's ever seen.",
  ["1001060101_125"]="Suddenly, a clear whistle pierces through the twilight mist of the forest, interrupting their conversation.",
  ["1001060101_126"]="Perplexed, Ji Xia examines the arrow.",
  ["1001060101_127"]="Several dark figures emerge from a distant hillside, with the foremost figure notably tall in the dusk.",
  ["1001060101_128"]="Their gazes meet unexpectedly.",
  ["1001060101_129"]="In that moment, both of them hear a resonating sound emanating from the void.",
  ["1001060101_13"]="The tiny turtle remains unmoved as a distant voice echoes from afar.",
  ["1001060101_130"]="It is the clash between a sword and a blade for the first time.",
  ["1001060101_131"]="Millennia later, when Ji Xia stood alone at the foot of Mount Tianque, he still heard that sound echoing in his ears.",
  ["1001060101_132"]="The blade had shattered, while the sword remained intact. Yet, the echo of that ancient clash endured, resonating throughout the expansive land of Qian for over 5,000 years, perpetually audible.",
  ["1001060101_133"]="The blade had shattered, while the sword remained intact. Yet, the echo of that ancient clash endured, resonating throughout the expansive land of Qian for over 5,000 years, perpetually audible.",
  ["1001060101_14"]="Chieftain.",
  ["1001060101_15"]="The young man does not react.",
  ["1001060101_16"]="Chieftain...!",
  ["1001060101_17"]="The youth remains undisturbed, seemingly oblivious to the call.",
  ["1001060101_18"]="Ji Xia!",
  ["1001060101_19"]="Startled by the sudden shout, the little turtle swiftly retreats into the water, leaving a trail of ripples behind.",
  ["1001060101_2"]="Around 4,500 before the World Calendar",
  ["1001060101_20"]="The young man turns his head in response.",
  ["1001060101_21"]="Oh, it's you, Cang Luo! You startled the little one.",
  ["1001060101_22"]="What little one?",
  ["1001060101_23"]="Ji Xia points towards the surface, where a stream of tiny bubbles dances on the water.",
  ["1001060101_24"]="Cang Luo does not ask further about what Ji Xia is indicating, simply shaking his head with a sigh.",
  ["1001060101_25"]="You're not a kid anymore. You're our chieftain, and yet you're here lounging around? You can't just run off and hang out here for fun, you know?",
  ["1001060101_26"]="Aha, I'm just taking a nap. Cut me some slack, brother Cang Luo.",
  ["1001060101_27"]="You haven't forgotten about the two clans we conquered and who've joined us, right? Their chieftains are on their way with their people, so you should show up and greet them.",
  ["1001060101_28"]="Also, messengers from three upstream clans have arrived. One wants to join us, another seeks peace, and the third is talking about wiping us out. You've got to figure out how to respond to them.",
  ["1001060101_29"]="Well, the last one is a bit tricky, and I'll handle it personally. As for the others, just help me out with them, brother Cang Luo.",
  ["1001060101_3"]="Around 4,500 before the World Calendar",
  ["1001060101_30"]="Ji Xia stands up.",
  ["1001060101_31"]="Those willing to join our clan, we'll accept them, and those seeking peace, we'll treat with respect... As for the ones drawing their weapons...",
  ["1001060101_32"]="He passes the turtle shell to Cang Luo.",
  ["1001060101_33"]="We'll reply with a letter, a declaration of war.",
  ["1001060101_34"]="Cang Luo pauses for a moment, then contemplatively fiddles with the turtle shell, asking.",
  ["1001060101_35"]="But they don't even have writing yet. Wouldn't it be better to send a messenger with a verbal message?",
  ["1001060101_36"]="Ji Xia smiles as he strolls along the river upstream.",
  ["1001060101_37"]="That's why we must write them a letter. Since they don't know how to write, we'll have the messenger read it to them. The characters you invented are our most powerful weapon, and it's just a shame few understand that.",
  ["1001060101_38"]="Cang Luo catches up with Ji Xia, walking beside him.",
  ["1001060101_39"]="...Even if you say so, I don't quite understand why words can be more powerful than spears and arrows. We're standing firm because we have a mighty chieftain.",
  ["1001060101_4"]="That was a distant era.&Back then, the mountains and rivers were young, unnamed living beings thrived without language, writing, or established doctrines.&The river flowed ceaselessly, nurturing the first people who prospered and multiplied.",
  ["1001060101_40"]="Haha, even if you're clueless, our future kin will get it.",
  ["1001060101_41"]="Well, what you've been doing always leaves us scratching our heads. But seriously, all things seem to work out fine in the end.",
  ["1001060101_42"]="Sure, I'll record your words as always. Maybe our future kin will grasp your wisdom better than I do.",
  ["1001060101_43"]="Stop thinking of me as some sage. I just have some insights, and that's all. By the way, I understand you record the formal conversations between clans, but do you really have to record our casual chats, too?",
  ["1001060101_44"]="That's where you miss the point. To you, it's chitchat, but down the line, it becomes \"history.\"",
  ["1001060101_45"]="...History? So, another new term?",
  ["1001060101_46"]="This world is full of unnamed things. We simply don't have enough words for them.",
  ["1001060101_47"]="Before you became the chieftain, I could sum up all I saw in a few words.",
  ["1001060101_48"]="The things that fly, we call them \"birds.\" The things with sharp fangs, we call them \"beasts.\" The things with scales, we call them \"fish.\" And for ourselves, we call us \"human.\"",
  ["1001060101_49"]="But under your leadership, our clan flourished. Our domain expanded with more people, and we need new words even if it's just for newborns.",
  ["1001060101_5"]="Back then, the mountains and rivers were young, unnamed living beings thrived without language, writing, or established doctrines.",
  ["1001060101_50"]="Birds in varied hues, beasts in diverse forms, and fish in all sizes demand a range of names.",
  ["1001060101_51"]="Oh, really? I haven't noticed that.",
  ["1001060101_52"]="It's just those clans upstream keep challenging us. We defeated them one after another, moving upstream, and that's all.",
  ["1001060101_53"]="Ji Xia stops, looking upstream where the river vanishes into the hanging clouds on the horizon.",
  ["1001060101_54"]="Well, we've come a long way indeed.",
  ["1001060101_55"]="It's incredible how the river still looks as vast and endless as when we first set out.",
  ["1001060101_56"]="When will it start to narrow down?",
  ["1001060101_57"]="Where does it trickle into a tiny stream?",
  ["1001060101_58"]="You're asking about the river's origin, right?",
  ["1001060101_59"]="Ji Xia bursts into laughter.",
  ["1001060101_6"]="The river flowed ceaselessly, nurturing the first inhabitants who thrived and multiplied.",
  ["1001060101_60"]="Well, there are too many questions I have in mind.",
  ["1001060101_61"]="How many people live along this grand river? How much land does it span? And what kind of lives do they lead?",
  ["1001060101_62"]="If they thrive, can we learn from them? And if they struggle, can we help them?",
  ["1001060101_63"]="Cang Luo also grins.",
  ["1001060101_64"]="Well... looks like I've got a lot ahead of me on this road with you.",
  ["1001060101_65"]="Hah, you don't say.",
  ["1001060101_66"]="Someday, you'll see our clan throughout the whole... Wait, what was that term you invented?",
  ["1001060101_67"]="World.",
  ["1001060101_68"]="Yeah, the whole world!",
  ["1001060101_69"]="Since you invented characters, you've named so much.",
  ["1001060101_7"]="The first sparks were lit, pottery and fishing nets were crafted, and rice was cultivated in fields cleared by stone tools.&An ancient civilization, later known as Qian, quietly took root.",
  ["1001060101_70"]="So, why not give this river a name too?",
  ["1001060101_71"]="Invent some new terms, a unique title befitting this majestic river, so that future generations know it was the Ji Clan who named it!",
  ["1001060101_72"]="...",
  ["1001060101_73"]="Hah, you do sound like a chieftain at times like these.",
  ["1001060101_74"]="But even so, just don't vanish without a word in the future.",
  ["1001060101_75"]="Alright, ease up. I'll make sure to leave a word before sneaking off next time.",
  ["1001060101_76"]="Suddenly, the young man's tone changes, shedding its previous gentleness.",
  ["1001060101_77"]="And draft another decree for me, informing the entire Ji Clan that we're marching to conquer the upstream clan that dared to challenge us.",
  ["1001060101_78"]="As usual, those willing to join me will march forth, and after victory, the conquered land will be theirs. As for those who decide to stay here, I won't force them to join the war.",
  ["1001060101_79"]="Sure.",
  ["1001060101_8"]="A young man with black hair squats by the bank, picking up a piece of sun-dried turtle shell from the sandy ground.",
  ["1001060101_80"]="To be honest, there's one thing that's been on my mind for a while. Whenever you issue an order, you've never considered what will happen if we lose the war.",
  ["1001060101_81"]="Huh? Why do I have to consider that?",
  ["1001060101_82"]="The young man's face still carries a hint of innocence, yet in both his words and gaze, there's a trace of boldness and ruthlessness typical of youth.",
  ["1001060101_83"]="If a mountain blocks, we scale it. If a river blocks, we cross it.",
  ["1001060101_84"]="If a boulder blocks, we break it. If a thorn blocks, we burn it.",
  ["1001060101_85"]="If a beast blocks, we hunt it. If a clan blocks, we conquer it.",
  ["1001060101_86"]="To me, the path ahead is just that simple.",
  ["1001060101_87"]="Later, the historical records of Qian contained this account.",
  ["1001060101_88"]="While overlooking the river, Cang Luo posed a question to the Emperor.&What if our clan faces defeat?&The Emperor chuckled in response.&Why worry? If a mountain blocks, we scale it. If a river blocks, we cross it. If a boulder blocks, we break it. If a thorn blocks, we burn it. If a beast blocks, we hunt it. If a clan blocks, we conquer it.&Such is how I conquer all challenges in the world.",
  ["1001060101_89"]="And so, this young clan continues their journey westward.",
  ["1001060101_9"]="Not far, among the aquatic plants, a little turtle cautiously extends its head, observing the young man on the shore.",
  ["1001060101_90"]="And so, this young clan continues their journey westward.",
  ["1001060101_91"]="Following the river's meandering path towards the setting sun.",
  ["1001060101_92"]="The mountains grow taller, the river more tumultuous. In the deep canyons, exotic birds perch on unfamiliar trees.",
  ["1001060101_93"]="Eventually, a glint of white appears in the distant sky, a hue colder and clearer than the clouds.",
  ["1001060101_94"]="Why is that mountain white? How interesting.",
  ["1001060101_95"]="That's snow, Chieftain.",
  ["1001060101_96"]="Oh, like the cold stuff that only falls in winter?",
  ["1001060101_97"]="But it's summer now, right?",
  ["1001060101_98"]="Higher places tend to be colder. Perhaps winter arrives early at such a high mountain.",
  ["1001060101_99"]="Ji Xia comments with indifference.",
  ["1001060201_1"]="Azi",
  ["1001060201_10"]="Ming Xiaomin is doing a great job evacuating the citizens here in such a short time, but that specific area...",
  ["1001060201_11"]="Her cellphone camera is directed towards the structures beyond the city. Despite the dense cerulean mist, numerous figures remain discernible.",
  ["1001060201_12"]="If only the evacuation halfway up the mountain could go as smoothly...",
  ["1001060201_13"]="Positioned along the upper reaches of the Grandeur River, QingYu City was more severely impacted by the Cerulean Blight compared to CangLin City, resulting in a quicker and more comprehensive evacuation.",
  ["1001060201_14"]="Within the vast city, apart from members of local clans hesitant to abandon their ancestral homes, only WeiShi members like Azi remain stationed there.",
  ["1001060201_15"]="Hey, that store looks familiar!",
  ["1001060201_16"]="Ancient QingYu Hotpot... Wait, isn't that the top pick on the \"ten must-eat restaurants list on QingYu Advisor?!",
  ["1001060201_17"]="I had to wait in line for nearly three hours just to check out this spot! Now, there's no line, but no people either...",
  ["1001060201_18"]="Ugh, this entire place is deserted. I remember when this street used to bustle with crowds...",
  ["1001060201_19"]="Hmm... maybe I can hit up all the stores on this street now?",
  ["1001060201_20"]="And I'll snap some pics, then create a special edit with a filter...",
  ["1001060201_21"]="The headline could be something like, \"A Shocking Sight: Unveiling an Empty QingYu City!\"",
  ["1001060201_22"]="Before I came here, Qing made it clear, \"Once you reach QingYu City, follow Master Yuanquan's lead and don't post anything online!\"",
  ["1001060201_23"]="But then again, if I don't seize this opportunity, I might never get such a chance again...",
  ["1001060201_24"]="A sudden noise behind her interrupts her internal conflict.",
  ["1001060201_25"]="As Azi looks back, the figures of beasts gradually emerge from the Cerulean Vapor.",
  ["1001060201_26"]="Let's address the situation first and save the photo talk for later!",
  ["1001060201_3"]="Millennia have passed, the once desolate mountain now forms the foundation of a bustling city.",
  ["1001060201_4"]="Qian's history may be extensive, but all of it closely links to this capital. Since its establishment during the era of the First Emperor, QingYu City has been a center of intrigue and conflict.",
  ["1001060201_5"]="Today, even this ancient city resembling jadeite is veiled in a cerulean mist — a foreboding haze descending from the mountaintop, enveloping this ancient city.",
  ["1001060201_6"]="Observation Pavilion, checked.",
  ["1001060201_7"]="Ancient City Alley, checked.",
  ["1001060201_8"]="Amid the city's crossroads, a purple flash swiftly moves atop the buildings, pausing occasionally to capture moments with her cellphone camera.",
  ["1001060201_9"]="Outer City, checked. No signs of residents.",
  ["1001060301_1"]="An empty road winds through mountain crevices.",
  ["1001060301_10"]="No... no, this spicy hotpot is making my mouth water... Don't hold me back! Why are you stopping me from adding some durian in the spicy pot...?",
  ["1001060301_11"]="...",
  ["1001060301_12"]="I glance back at Zero.",
  ["1001060301_13"]="Are you hungry?",
  ["1001060301_14"]="Zero shakes her head.",
  ["1001060301_15"]="Let's just eat something.",
  ["1001060301_16"]="Retrieving a loaf of bread from beneath the seat, I pass it to Zero.",
  ["1001060301_17"]="Zero accepts it quietly and tears open the plastic wrapping.",
  ["1001060301_18"]="Just as the crinkle of the torn packaging fills the air, Xin, who has been dozing with her eyes shut, abruptly springs up from her seat.",
  ["1001060301_19"]="What? Are you trying to sneak some treats without me?!",
  ["1001060301_2"]="The mountains lining the road are contorted and seemingly endless. After driving alone for a while, a sense of potentially being lost amidst the peaks and valleys indefinitely begins to creep in.",
  ["1001060301_20"]="By then, Zero has already taken an indifferent bite of the bread. She gives Xin a sideways glance without speaking.",
  ["1001060301_21"]="Then, I retrieve another loaf of bread, tossing it towards Xin's head.",
  ["1001060301_22"]="With a deft leap, she catches the bread in her mouth before her head hits the roof.",
  ["1001060301_23"]="We're almost there.",
  ["1001060301_24"]="Is that Mount Tianque?",
  ["1001060301_25"]="Let me see... Oh, yeah! We're getting close! That's Mount Tianque, right? Soon we'll have a view of QingYu City...",
  ["1001060301_26"]="Someone just eats and sleeps all day...",
  ["1001060301_27"]="Someone is supposed to be guiding us here...",
  ["1001060301_28"]="She swiftly finishes the bread.",
  ["1001060301_29"]="Or what? Should I have some pleasant chats with this miss big eye poker face?",
  ["1001060301_3"]="Eventually, a glimmer of white emerges in the distant sky.",
  ["1001060301_30"]="She swiftly finishes the bread.",
  ["1001060301_31"]="I'm your guide, and I've already picked you up! If you need directions, just ask the GPS in your car.",
  ["1001060301_32"]="Once I get you to QingYu City safely, we're all set.",
  ["1001060301_33"]="Xin casts a look outside the window.",
  ["1001060301_34"]="Once we get a bit closer, we'll be able to see it.",
  ["1001060301_35"]="Honestly, it's quite strange.",
  ["1001060301_36"]="Huh? What's so strange?",
  ["1001060301_37"]="Building a city atop a mountain.",
  ["1001060301_38"]="No matter how I think about it, a snowy mountain is definitely not the most ideal location for establishing a country's capital.",
  ["1001060301_39"]="I can't help but ponder what the original founder witnessed on the mountain that led to choosing this place over the vast plains. Was it the breathtaking scenery, or insurmountable challenges?",
  ["1001060301_4"]="That is the perpetual snow atop the towering peaks.",
  ["1001060301_40"]="Daylight casts shadows on the horizon, shaping the mountain peaks.",
  ["1001060301_41"]="The melting snow transfigures into drifting clouds cascading over the waterfalls.",
  ["1001060301_42"]="Bridges span over the waves, and intricate pathways float in the air.",
  ["1001060301_43"]="The ancient architecture, with its substantial eaves and tiles reminiscent of pages in a millennium-old book, unveils the extensive history.",
  ["1001060301_5"]="Noticing the white hue, I turn to my companions in the backseat, prepared to remind them of our impending arrival.",
  ["1001060301_6"]="As anticipated, Zero has been silently observing me. Just as I glance back, our eyes meet.",
  ["1001060301_7"]="I shift my gaze to Xin, who is dozing off in another seat.",
  ["1001060301_8"]="Hey, wake up.",
  ["1001060301_9"]="You're drooling on the seat.",
  ["1001060401_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001060401_10"]="Without looking back, Ji Xia remains focused on the mountain.",
  ["1001060401_11"]="How many battles have we fought with them?",
  ["1001060401_12"]="Cang Luo hesitates momentarily before responding.",
  ["1001060401_13"]="This is our fourteenth encounter. So far, we've had 3 draws and 11 defeats, but no victories... We've never faced such a setback before.",
  ["1001060401_14"]="...No victories.",
  ["1001060401_15"]="Ji Xia covers his mouth with one hand, repeating the two words as if savoring them.",
  ["1001060401_16"]="Cang Luo, unable to see Ji Xia's expression, assumes his chieftain is harboring frustration and tries to console him.",
  ["1001060401_17"]="The scouts I sent out have gathered information. Our opponents are the Tianli Clan. They've been here long before we began our journey.",
  ["1001060401_18"]="They are natural hunters, known for their bravery and combat skills.",
  ["1001060401_19"]="Many clans along our path have refused to join us in the fight because they fear their strength.",
  ["1001060401_2"]="Lord of Weaponry",
  ["1001060401_20"]="Should we consider a temporary retreat to regroup?",
  ["1001060401_21"]="Retreat? Why retreat?",
  ["1001060401_22"]="Ji Xia tilts his head slightly. In that moment, Cang Luo realizes that Ji Xia's eyes sparkle with unprecedented excitement rather than frustration.",
  ["1001060401_23"]="Suppressing the surge of excitement within him, Ji Xia struggles to maintain composure, lest he burst into laughter inappropriately.",
  ["1001060401_24"]="Throughout their extensive travels, Cang Luo has never seen Ji Xia display such an expression.",
  ["1001060401_25"]="Despite the excitement in his tone, his words carry a tone of wisdom.",
  ["1001060401_26"]="There's a first time for everything. While they are skilled fighters, they are not unbeatable.",
  ["1001060401_27"]="I can handle their tactics and strategies, but there's one thing we can't defend against.",
  ["1001060401_28"]="Their weapons, that's it.",
  ["1001060401_29"]="...Yes, I've heard about it. Our soldiers from the battlefield mentioned they were using... cerulean weapons.",
  ["1001060401_3"]="The Ji Clan has traveled thousands of miles up the river without facing a single defeat...",
  ["1001060401_30"]="Yeah, those weapons are way beyond our understanding. Not only is the color unfamiliar, but the material is like nothing we've ever seen.",
  ["1001060401_31"]="Their weapons slice through flesh and bone effortlessly, and nothing can withstand their edges.",
  ["1001060401_32"]="Our people are murmuring that there's dark magic on those weapons, with the souls of the dead trapped inside, making them invincible...",
  ["1001060401_33"]="Ji Xia seems to have a moment of realization.",
  ["1001060401_34"]="Haha, that's absurd. Those wielding the weapons are clearly living people.",
  ["1001060401_35"]="Cang Luo lets out a soft sigh.",
  ["1001060401_36"]="The lands for hundreds of miles around the Immense Mountain bow to the might of the Tianli, led by their renowned Lord of Weaponry.",
  ["1001060401_37"]="Ji Xia's interest is piqued.",
  ["1001060401_38"]="Lord of Weaponry? How intriguing. Does that mean he's the master of the world's deadliest weapons?",
  ["1001060401_39"]="That's the story making the rounds. They claim he was the first to craft those unique cerulean weapons, and ever since then, the Tianli Clan has been invincible.",
  ["1001060401_4"]="Until today.",
  ["1001060401_40"]="Honestly, I'm more inclined to believe they have some secret techniques for forging those weapons.",
  ["1001060401_41"]="If only we could get our hands on some of their weapons, that would be something... Despite the clashes, we haven't been able to seize even a dagger from them.",
  ["1001060401_42"]="Oh, that reminds me. I almost forgot that... Ouch...",
  ["1001060401_44"]="A broken arrow is lodged in Ji Xia's shoulder, the wound deep enough to reveal bone. Despite his injury, Ji Xia acts as if nothing has happened.",
  ["1001060401_45"]="Your shoulder! Who dared to harm you?!",
  ["1001060401_46"]="Confronted by Cang Luo's concerned gaze, Ji Xia reveals a grim smile.",
  ["1001060401_47"]="Well, it was someone interesting who anticipated my dodge.",
  ["1001060401_48"]="Ji Xia's eyes narrow slightly as he recalls the critical moment when the arrow sliced through the air.",
  ["1001060401_5"]="The young man returns from the battlefield, stained in blood.",
  ["1001060401_50"]="If he had not reacted swiftly, dodging at the last second, the arrow would have pierced his heart.",
  ["1001060401_51"]="Unlike the earlier warning shot, this arrow was aimed at ending his life.",
  ["1001060401_52"]="The rush of returning from battle has subsided as the searing pain creeps up his arm.",
  ["1001060401_53"]="At this moment, every pore in his body aches for retribution, for the archer to pay for the pain, the humiliation, and the defiance.",
  ["1001060401_54"]="Ji Xia probes his wound, clenches his teeth, and with determination, yanks the arrow out.",
  ["1001060401_55"]="Ji Xia!... I'll find a healer right away!",
  ["1001060401_56"]="No worries. I'll tend to it myself.",
  ["1001060401_57"]="With a makeshift treatment that barely stops the bleeding, the young man ignores his wound and begins examining the cerulean arrow in his hand, stained with his blood.",
  ["1001060401_58"]="You said you wanted their weapon, right? Here you go.",
  ["1001060401_59"]="If my hunch is correct, a material this valuable wouldn't be entrusted to just anyone.",
  ["1001060401_6"]="His gaze fixates on the snowy peaks, lost in contemplation.",
  ["1001060401_60"]="Only their leader would be deemed worthy of using such deadly arrows.",
  ["1001060401_61"]="The enemy, seasoned in battle, wouldn't be careless enough to leave their weapons behind.",
  ["1001060401_62"]="On the other hand, taking their weapons by force has proven impossible.",
  ["1001060401_63"]="Therefore, the only viable method.",
  ["1001060401_64"]="While the arrow was undoubtedly shot by a seasoned archer, the target was not defenseless prey.",
  ["1001060401_65"]="The young man turns over the broken shaft, the icy aura of the cerulean arrowhead piercing his gaze.",
  ["1001060401_66"]="Lord of Weaponry, huh? Great... I'm looking forward to our next encounter.",
  ["1001060401_67"]="The Tianli Clan has inhabited the snowy mountain for many generations, undefeated throughout the passing years.",
  ["1001060401_68"]="And their legacy remains unbroken to this day.",
  ["1001060401_69"]="Skeletons, blood, battlefield... Tianli people are no strangers to any of this.",
  ["1001060401_7"]="Ji Xia...",
  ["1001060401_70"]="The origin of the invaders or their reasons matter not.",
  ["1001060401_71"]="They ensure that in each fight, more blood is shed by the invaders than by their members.",
  ["1001060401_72"]="Thus, the fame of the \"Lord of Weapons\" reverberates for hundreds of miles, causing all other clans to bow before him.",
  ["1001060401_73"]="Amidst the chaos, a towering figure meticulously collects arrows strewn across the battlefield, placing them back with care.",
  ["1001060401_74"]="Cerulean Crystals are rare, and he never wanted to use these precious arrows until absolutely necessary.",
  ["1001060401_75"]="Once unleashed, his arrows have never missed their mark.",
  ["1001060401_76"]="For every shot taken, a life is claimed. After each victory, he retrieves the arrows from his fallen foes for the next combat.",
  ["1001060401_77"]="After examining the last corpse and securing the last arrow, he returns the quiver to his shoulder, glancing at the neatly arranged arrows.",
  ["1001060401_78"]="Suddenly, he halts his actions, examining the arrows once more.",
  ["1001060401_79"]="It is not due to his miscalculation.",
  ["1001060401_8"]="Ji Xia.",
  ["1001060401_80"]="One of the cerulean arrows, crafted by himself, is missing.",
  ["1001060401_81"]="Ji Xia adjusts the cloak on his injured left shoulder, catching Cang Luo's wide-eyed stare.",
  ["1001060401_82"]="Ji Xia adjusts the cloak on his injured left shoulder, catching Cang Luo's wide-eyed stare.",
  ["1001060401_9"]="Ji Xia!",
  ["1001060501_1"]="Rendezvous",
  ["1001060501_10"]="Xin, unfamiliar with the city, studies the map in confusion.",
  ["1001060501_11"]="I've never been here before, but Qing mentioned someone will be picking us up...",
  ["1001060501_12"]="Who's there?",
  ["1001060501_13"]="Any idea who that might be?",
  ["1001060501_14"]="Let's hope it's someone dependable this time...",
  ["1001060501_15"]="It's someone pesky. Seriously.",
  ["1001060501_16"]="I'm not really acquainted with her... Ugh, what a hassle! It's annoying to think we're about to meet that pesky girl.",
  ["1001060501_17"]="My senses tell me that you are insulting me in your tone.",
  ["1001060501_18"]="...",
  ["1001060501_19"]="At that moment, Zero gently tugs at my sleeve, and I promptly quiet down.",
  ["1001060501_2"]="When we reach the base of Mount Tianque, the mist thickens, prompting us to continue on foot.",
  ["1001060501_20"]="From deep within the mist, a faint buzzing noise reverberates.",
  ["1001060501_21"]="When all human voices disappearing, the noise, reminiscent of a dragonfly fluttering its wings, becomes distinct as it draws near.",
  ["1001060501_22"]="Xin narrows her eyes as her lance pierces through the mist, accurately pinning the source of the noise against the wall.",
  ["1001060501_23"]="In the next moment, a shriek pierces the air as a purple figure drops in front of us like a bolt of lightning.",
  ["1001060501_24"]="Kong! Noooooo! My Kong!!",
  ["1001060501_25"]="It turns out the noise comes from a drone-like contraption, and the girl who suddenly appeared is now lamenting over its wreckage.",
  ["1001060501_26"]="Xin eases up as soon as she recognizes the person, returning to her usual casual demeanor.",
  ["1001060501_27"]="A friend of yours?",
  ["1001060501_28"]="Maybe you can introduce her to us?",
  ["1001060501_29"]="Well, this is the girl who picks us up, a weirdo who enjoys giving her drones names.",
  ["1001060501_3"]="As we step into QingYu City, the first sound that greets us is the gentle gurgle of water. The landscape presents a blend of white clouds and snow against verdant mountains and sky.",
  ["1001060501_30"]="W-weirdo?! Who are you calling a weirdo! You ruined the grand entrance I had planned! And now you've got to fix my Kong...",
  ["1001060501_31"]="...",
  ["1001060501_32"]="Come to me.",
  ["1001060501_33"]="I step back and position myself next to Zero, staying out of range of any potential clashes.",
  ["1001060501_34"]="Looks like they know each other.",
  ["1001060501_35"]="They seem like friends.",
  ["1001060501_36"]="That girl doesn't appear any stronger than Xin...",
  ["1001060501_37"]="Well...",
  ["1001060501_38"]="Calm down! Stop tugging on my collar! We have someone else here!",
  ["1001060501_39"]="Azi regains some of her composure.",
  ["1001060501_4"]="A three-hundred-foot waterfall cascades, into a two-thousand-mile river's serenade.",
  ["1001060501_40"]="Ahem... Sorry, got a bit carried away.",
  ["1001060501_41"]="She swiftly composes herself, adopting a more \"businesslike\" demeanor.",
  ["1001060501_42"]="Well, before I introduce myself, let me update Master Yuanquan on the situation here. Oh, and let's take a group photo first.",
  ["1001060501_43"]="The purple-haired girl, who appears to immediately see us as her friends, rushes over to us while chattering, leaving no room for Zero or me to interject.",
  ["1001060501_44"]="Say cheese!",
  ["1001060501_45"]="Cheese!",
  ["1001060501_46"]="Hold on.",
  ["1001060501_47"]="But we barely know each other...",
  ["1001060501_48"]="As the shutter clicks, three faces appear on her phone screen.",
  ["1001060501_49"]="Alright... Oh, wait! I forgot to turn on the filter.",
  ["1001060501_5"]="Subsequently, like blank paper waiting for ink, the scene fills with the hustle and bustle of life.",
  ["1001060501_50"]="Nah, the angle's not great, and my face looks huge... but why do the other two look so good? Taking photos is just mysterious...",
  ["1001060501_51"]="Let's take one more. And this time, you hold the phone up.",
  ["1001060501_52"]="She adjusts the settings slightly and hands her cellphone to me.",
  ["1001060501_53"]="I instinctively accept the phone and follow her instructions.",
  ["1001060501_54"]="Raise it higher, yeah... Hey, lovely lady? Give us a smile! Or use your hand to lift the corners of your mouth. Just don't frown.",
  ["1001060501_55"]="...",
  ["1001060501_56"]="The shutter clicks again.",
  ["1001060501_57"]="Perfect! These pics look great! I'm posting this now! \"Visitors from afar! The magical mix of Qian and Obed! #QingYu City #Hanze Region #Daily #GirlyFun\"...",
  ["1001060501_58"]="By the way, do you have social media accounts here? No? I'll sign you up, it's super easy! And don't forget to follow me...",
  ["1001060501_59"]="Hey, snap out of it! Why did that old man even send you here?",
  ["1001060501_6"]="Beams, eaves, tiles, abodes, bridges, roads, residences, edifices, halls, pavilions... all emerge one after another.",
  ["1001060501_60"]="Please don't post our Head Librarian's photo on any social media. That might cause trouble for us.",
  ["1001060501_61"]="The purple-haired girl slumped down like a deflated balloon.",
  ["1001060501_62"]="Alright, alright... Why is everyone in C.A.V.E so stubborn and old-fashioned? It's the Internet age, you know?",
  ["1001060501_63"]="Oh, where are my manners! I'm Tang Zi from WeiShi, and my friends call me Azi. I've got a million followers on all social media platforms! Just hit that Like button and Follow me! Don't give me that look, Xin. Of course I remember what I'm supposed to do.",
  ["1001060501_64"]="Master Yuanquan asked me to escort you into the city because of the situation here... Yeah, you know.",
  ["1001060501_65"]="Since you're here, I believe you've sorted out the crisis in CangLin City?",
  ["1001060501_66"]="Yeah, it's mostly under control... Qing's handling the aftermath there.",
  ["1001060501_67"]="But it always feels like our opponent has the upper hand.",
  ["1001060501_68"]="So we're here to tackle the root of the problem. If we don't fix things here, CangLin City, or even the entire Grandeur River region, won't see peace.",
  ["1001060501_69"]="By the way, does that old man have a plan?",
  ["1001060501_7"]="A vivid painting unfurls, capturing the essence of bygone eras, portraying a grand tapestry of the beautiful city landscape.",
  ["1001060501_70"]="You'll have to ask Master Yuanquan himself. Let's go. He's waiting for you.",
  ["1001060501_8"]="Despite its lacking residents, remnants of its past prosperity linger.",
  ["1001060501_9"]="Tables at roadside taverns hold untouched mugs, as if their owners might return at any moment to resume their morning libations.",
  ["1001060502_1"]="Qingyu City, with its long history, is an ancient place steeped in time. The decorative patterns on the buildings along the way have long since faded, many barely recognizable beneath layers of vines. Yet, one design remains clear: the red-crowned crane.",
  ["1001060502_10"]="Later, the crane was kept in the palace gardens, though not in the usual sense. Back then, people revered this beautiful bird, allowing it to come and go as it pleased. Over time, it became linked to more and more legends...",
  ["1001060502_11"]="One account claims the crane was immortal, and as long as it remained on Mount Tianque, the dynasty founded by Ji Xia would never fall. But when it flew away and never returned, it would mark the end of Ji Xia's dynasty.",
  ["1001060502_12"]="Another tale tells that the crane's feathers would change colors over time: white for five hundred years, then red for the next five hundred, followed by blue for another five hundred, before returning to white once again. This cyclical transformation was seen as a reflection of the eternal rise and fall of the world.",
  ["1001060502_13"]="But after Ji Xia's final journey and disappearance, the strange crane was never seen again. Over the years, people on Mount Tianque occasionally heard mysterious bird calls with no known source. It was believed to be the call of Ji Xia's crane, as the saying goes, \"The crane calls in the nine gullies, its voice heard in the heavens\".",
  ["1001060502_14"]="Ahem, these are just things I've heard from others! If you're really interested, there's someone in WeiShi named Ming Xiaomin who's an expert in this field. You could ask her when you get the chance.",
  ["1001060502_15"]="Enough of that, there are plenty of crane statues around here. We'll see more later! Let's go visit the ancestral home of Tianli! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!",
  ["1001060502_16"]="Just as I am about to catch up with Azi and Xin, Zero, standing by my side, gazes skyward.",
  ["1001060502_17"]="What's wrong?",
  ["1001060502_18"]="Instinctively, I follow her gaze, catching a glimpse of a blurred figure amidst the clouds.",
  ["1001060502_19"]="A white feather drifts in on the breeze, settling into my palm.",
  ["1001060502_2"]="I had been observing for a while, and this wasn't just my imagination. In Qingyu City, red-crowned crane motifs stood out far more than those of any other animal. But why had they withstood the passage of time while so many others had faded?",
  ["1001060502_20"]="It appears to be a tail plume from some enormous bird. As I twist the feather between my fingers and observe it, cerulean hues flowing through its hollow shaft furrow my brow.",
  ["1001060502_21"]="Is this the feather of a... crane?",
  ["1001060502_22"]="Ann darts from beneath Zero's cloak, delicately perching in my palm and inspecting the feather.",
  ["1001060502_23"]="Unusually, it refrains from blabbering this time, merely pecking at the feather, which then fragments into myriad light particles, dispersing into the air.",
  ["1001060502_24"]="(This feather feels ominous. I'll hold onto it for you.)",
  ["1001060502_25"]="(We've entered the territory of some big player, and I'm afraid you've caught its attention already. This is how it marks its target.)",
  ["1001060502_26"]="Can you fix it?",
  ["1001060502_27"]="(If I were my former self, it'd be a piece of cake. But now...)",
  ["1001060502_28"]="The bird stretches its beak high and yawns.",
  ["1001060502_29"]="(Chirp... I'm just a little innocent bird in need of some good rest. Be careful and only wake me when absolutely necessary!)",
  ["1001060502_3"]="Even here, in this area shrouded in Cerulean Vapor, the crane designs on the walls appeared as if they were about to break through the surface.",
  ["1001060502_30"]="You chubby chicken!",
  ["1001060502_31"]="Hey! Why are you still there? Come to me, or you'll wander off into the mist!",
  ["1001060502_32"]="Alright, I'm coming!",
  ["1001060502_33"]="High in the sky, the silhouette of a giant bird soared gracefully.",
  ["1001060502_34"]="It had witnessed countless things, remembered many, and forgotten even more.",
  ["1001060502_35"]="Beneath it, a thriving world unfolded like a painting.",
  ["1001060502_36"]="If it had memories, it would see that the mountains remained unchanged, and the rivers flowed as they always had.",
  ["1001060502_37"]="The heavens, the earth, the sun, and the moon remained unaltered.",
  ["1001060502_38"]="Everything else had changed beyond recognition.",
  ["1001060502_39"]="The small seeds of the past, once scattered among the wild grass, had now blossomed into towering trees.",
  ["1001060502_4"]="Come to think of it, the people of Qian seem to really like cranes.",
  ["1001060502_40"]="The green rooftops, before being tarnished by rust, once gleamed with brilliance.",
  ["1001060502_41"]="The clothing, livelihoods, spoken language, and written words of the people had all changed beyond recognition.",
  ["1001060502_42"]="It had journeyed thousands of miles and witnessed another sea, where the stars formed different constellations.",
  ["1001060502_43"]="Its footprints had touched many lands, places where strange plants, fruits, and insects thrived.",
  ["1001060502_44"]="But for some reason, it always returned here.",
  ["1001060502_45"]="Its life was no longer bound by the instinct to reproduce, and thus, it did not need to migrate.",
  ["1001060502_46"]="Unlike migratory birds tethered by nesting habits, it was free.",
  ["1001060502_47"]="Still, whether decades or centuries passed, it always returned to this familiar place to see the sights once more.",
  ["1001060502_48"]="If it could read, it might describe this place as \"home\".",
  ["1001060502_49"]="Like a magnet pointing north, like the stars showing the way.",
  ["1001060502_5"]="Do cranes hold any special meaning?",
  ["1001060502_50"]="The giant bird didn't know what it was waiting for. Every time it returned, fewer and fewer familiar things remained.",
  ["1001060502_51"]="This time should have been no different.",
  ["1001060502_52"]="Yet, amidst the bustling lives below, it felt, for the first time in ages, a faint but unmistakable sense of familiarity.",
  ["1001060502_53"]="Driven by curiosity, it approached the densely populated area, leaving a single feather behind.",
  ["1001060502_54"]="The giant bird didn't know why it did this, but just as a crow recognizes its own kin, its instincts told it that somewhere on this soil was a \"familiar face\".",
  ["1001060502_6"]="Are cranes considered auspicious symbols?",
  ["1001060502_7"]="Huh? Oh, you're asking about that!",
  ["1001060502_8"]="Yes, Qian does regard cranes as symbols of good fortune, but they aren't worshiped in every household. Qingyu City is an exception.",
  ["1001060502_9"]="Now, what was the story again... I remember Lord Yuanquan mentioning it... Ah, yes! During the founding of Ji Xia's kingdom, a strange crane descended upon a mountain peak. The people at the time saw it as an auspicious omen, and they even recorded it in the history books.",
  ["1001060601_1"]="Outlanders",
  ["1001060601_10"]="\"Journey of a Tang Sect Disciple as a Tianli Clan Member in QingYu City!\" Oh, this plan rocks! Guaranteed to reel in more followers!",
  ["1001060601_11"]="And hey, if you're looking to get some ancient QingYu-style souvenirs or traditional Tianli handicrafts, here's a tip: skip the stalls and head straight online. They're all churned out by the same factory anyway...",
  ["1001060601_12"]="Huh? But aren't you Tianli people live-streaming the crafting of handicrafts?",
  ["1001060601_13"]="The man rolls his eyes.",
  ["1001060601_14"]="Seriously, who's got time for actual crafting nowadays? Sure, the few pieces showcased in the streams might be authentic, but the rest? Mass-produced. Why break a sweat when you can just tap a few buttons and rake in the cash?",
  ["1001060601_15"]="But you know, factory-made ensures quality control and all that. If it's truly handmade, I'd doubt the quality!",
  ["1001060601_16"]="...",
  ["1001060601_17"]="I see...",
  ["1001060601_18"]="He's just kidding, Zero.",
  ["1001060601_19"]="Could you please change the subject?",
  ["1001060601_2"]="Along the journey, the man claiming to be a Tianli clansman seems entirely at ease, conversing casually with us.",
  ["1001060601_20"]="(Cover Zero's ears.)",
  ["1001060601_21"]="...But that's fraud!",
  ["1001060601_22"]="Hey, hey, let's not jump to conclusions! We're from the Tianli Clan. All our designs are steeped in tradition, and we manually operate those buttons! So, what's fraudulent about our \"traditional\" \"Tianli\" \"handcrafts\"?",
  ["1001060601_23"]="...",
  ["1001060601_24"]="...",
  ["1001060601_25"]="Alright, what about the classic bronze wares in the antique market? Are they the real deal?",
  ["1001060601_26"]="Well, the wares are made of real bronze, and the styles and patterns are genuinely classical. As for whether they are antique, let's think about it this way: when you adorn your space with these bronzes, it's all about the vibe. Who cares if they're truly antique when you've got that vibe, right?",
  ["1001060601_27"]="...",
  ["1001060601_28"]="...",
  ["1001060601_29"]="...",
  ["1001060601_3"]="So, you're outlanders, huh? It's a pity I can't give you a tour right now, but once this situation is sorted, I'll show you around the royal palace! For free!",
  ["1001060601_30"]="Geez, they say you Tianli people are stubborn, but you know what? You're staying current much better than the old-timers in my sect!",
  ["1001060601_31"]="Hehe, thanks for the compliment. It's all about making ends meet, you know.",
  ["1001060601_32"]="Xin notices the weapons carried by the Tianli resident and changes the subject.",
  ["1001060601_33"]="Your weapons are quite unique. I've never seen weapons like these before.",
  ["1001060601_34"]="Just some items handed down from our ancestors. Solid and dependable, nothing too flashy.",
  ["1001060601_35"]="You talk a lot about your ancestors. Is your tradition a big deal for you?",
  ["1001060601_36"]="Absolutely. We're an ancient tribe, and tradition runs in our veins. How could we have survived through the ages without holding onto our heritage?",
  ["1001060601_37"]="Honestly, our ancestors prohibited us from leaving QingYu City. Despite the changes over the centuries, our clan has remained steadfast since the city's construction.",
  ["1001060601_38"]="We thought we'd seen everything in the world, but truth be told, this is the first time I've encountered beasts with metal scales.",
  ["1001060601_39"]="Hold on, what did you say? You saw... metal scales on those beasts?",
  ["1001060601_4"]="But isn't that a popular spot? Don't we need to buy tickets?",
  ["1001060601_40"]="Yeah, didn't you notice? Oh, I see. Only a few of them have developed those metal scales, while most still appear normal, just a bit unusual in size and skin color...",
  ["1001060601_41"]="...",
  ["1001060601_42"]="Hey, looks like these Tianli people can spot anomalies! Chirp, chirp!",
  ["1001060601_43"]="Hey, don't just pop out from under a lady's clothes...",
  ["1001060601_44"]="Can't you stop popping out of nowhere and startling people?",
  ["1001060601_45"]="Zero, keep this chubby chicken in line.",
  ["1001060601_46"]="Chirp! How rude! Shouldn't a cute little bird like me always be welcomed with open arms?",
  ["1001060601_47"]="Quiet down.",
  ["1001060601_48"]="Chirp! Chirp!",
  ["1001060601_49"]="With a couple of flaps, the bird vanishes into thin air.",
  ["1001060601_5"]="Well, visitors do, but we've been around for ages, and all the attractions in QingYu City are free for us. I can arrange things a bit so you can enter as my relatives...",
  ["1001060601_50"]="...Mind if we swing by your place for a bit? We'd love to learn more about the \"metal\" on those beasts.",
  ["1001060601_51"]="Of course, I was planning to greet you as our esteemed guests.",
  ["1001060601_6"]="Xin appears astonished.",
  ["1001060601_7"]="But isn't that like... sneaking in? Qing wouldn't approve of that...",
  ["1001060601_8"]="Well, let's call it... flexible kinship, yeah! You saved my boy, right? So, you've given him a second chance at life, making you his godparents and my relatives, wouldn't you agree?",
  ["1001060601_9"]="While Xin struggles with the concept of \"flexible kinship,\" Azi's eyes light up.",
  ["1001060602_1"]="The teenager strolls over. Although still in adolescence and not quite tall, his eyes exude a commanding presence.",
  ["1001060602_2"]="Li Chi, the patriarch of the Tianli Clan.",
  ["1001060602_3"]="I thank you for saving my people, outsiders.",
  ["1001060701_1"]="Reserved Placeholder",
  ["1001060701_10"]="Do we take the shot?",
  ["1001060701_11"]="Ready your bows, but do not release any arrows without my command.",
  ["1001060701_12"]="Yeah.",
  ["1001060701_13"]="Unsure if it is his imagination, but the towering figure feels as if the lone wanderer below shares a glance with him and offers a gentle smile.",
  ["1001060701_14"]="Soon, a melodious voice drifts on the wind, drawing closer until it becomes distinct.",
  ["1001060701_15"]="...Amidst blooming vetch, my steps take flight; my love's words, a promise bright. Yet the year's end draws near, his absence whispers a lingering fear!",
  ["1001060701_16"]="Amidst blooming vetch, I wander; my love's words, a promise to ponder. Yet his return remains unseen, my concerns linger, in between.",
  ["1001060701_17"]="Nock the arrow.",
  ["1001060701_18"]="Despite facing drawn bows and gleaming arrowheads, the young man boldly strides into the center of the encirclement.",
  ["1001060701_19"]="Halt there, stranger. State your business.",
  ["1001060701_2"]="Blooming Vetch",
  ["1001060701_20"]="Ji Xia, the chieftain of the Ji Clan, greets the Tianli Clan patriarch.",
  ["1001060701_21"]="Aiming arrows at a guest isn't exactly our idea of hospitality.",
  ["1001060701_22"]="Do you realize your predicament? A word from me, and you'll meet your end.",
  ["1001060701_23"]="Yet here I am, alive and well. So, we still have a chance to talk this through, right?",
  ["1001060701_24"]="...Hmph, you've got some nerve.",
  ["1001060701_25"]="I am Li Jun.",
  ["1001060701_26"]="Upon hearing this, the young man retrieves a cerulean arrowhead from his pocket, placing it at his feet.",
  ["1001060701_27"]="I've brought only this humble gift. Please accept it as a gesture of goodwill.",
  ["1001060701_28"]="Li Jun simply scoffs at the arrowhead.",
  ["1001060701_29"]="I crafted this arrowhead with my own hands. You took it from me, and now you're calling it a gift?",
  ["1001060701_3"]="The mountains remain ageless, unless burdened by the weight of snow.",
  ["1001060701_30"]="We've clashed twenty-seven times, and only once have you left one of these arrows on the battlefield.",
  ["1001060701_31"]="The one that lodged in my shoulder, to be precise.",
  ["1001060701_32"]="I figured this arrowhead must hold such significance that even the Lord of Weaponry wouldn't wish to discard it, so I've come to return it personally.",
  ["1001060701_33"]="Is my sincerity not a gift?",
  ["1001060701_34"]="Let's cut to the chase. What exactly brings you here?",
  ["1001060701_35"]="I've come to propose a truce.",
  ["1001060701_36"]="Li Jun bursts into laughter.",
  ["1001060701_37"]="Hah... a truce? I don't recall being defeated by your people. Do you really believe you hold the upper hand to propose a truce?",
  ["1001060701_38"]="Ji Xia's smile remains unwavering.",
  ["1001060701_39"]="It's true that you've got superior armor and weapons, and we struggle to match your military might.",
  ["1001060701_4"]="It is autumn, when cold winds dispel all warmth under those snowy peaks.",
  ["1001060701_40"]="However, we have vast lands and numerous people. While we may lose many battles, all it takes is one victory over you. You may keep winning, but one defeat, and you'll lose it all.",
  ["1001060701_41"]="Winter is approaching, and your recent focus on us may leave you short on manpower for hunting and winter preparations. Can you tough it out?",
  ["1001060701_42"]="You think threats like that will intimidate me?",
  ["1001060701_43"]="I'm sure you caught the melody I sang earlier.",
  ["1001060701_44"]="Heh, yeah, but I don't quite get that \"vetch\" or whatever.",
  ["1001060701_45"]="Vetch is a plant with purple flowers, and it's edible. It thrives where the great river flows, much warmer than here.",
  ["1001060701_46"]="That's where our journey began, all the way upstream to your territory.",
  ["1001060701_47"]="From the lands of endless winters to the fields blooming with vetch, it's all our territory.",
  ["1001060701_48"]="You know I speak the truth. With our lands tenfold yours, and our people a hundred times as many, we will prevail in the end.",
  ["1001060701_49"]="Even the toughest dam won't hold back a relentless river forever.",
  ["1001060701_5"]="Along a rugged mountain path, a lone figure in black trudges onward.",
  ["1001060701_50"]="...But that's not what I'm after.",
  ["1001060701_51"]="That song is called \"Blooming Vetch,\" a popular tune among my people.",
  ["1001060701_52"]="The war is about to end, yet for some reason, it doesn't.",
  ["1001060701_53"]="The end of the year is around the corner, yet the soldiers haven't returned home.",
  ["1001060701_54"]="Your people are longing for home.",
  ["1001060701_55"]="Exactly. If this continues, both sides will suffer even greater losses.",
  ["1001060701_56"]="...That's why I'm here. Let's end this war once and for all.",
  ["1001060701_57"]="We aim to unite, not obliterate. We don't seek an endless conflict.",
  ["1001060701_58"]="...",
  ["1001060701_59"]="...What exactly do you seek?",
  ["1001060701_6"]="At the path's end, a towering figure gazes down.",
  ["1001060701_60"]="Ji Xia gazes intensely at Li Jun.",
  ["1001060701_61"]="We seek a world where our clans can coexist and prosper in peace, without the need for battle or starvation.",
  ["1001060701_62"]="...",
  ["1001060701_63"]="Li Jun contemplates for a long moment.",
  ["1001060701_64"]="Alright, but under one condition.",
  ["1001060701_65"]="Please go ahead.",
  ["1001060701_66"]="You've shown courage by coming here alone. However, in our tradition, once a war begins, there is no middle ground — only victory or defeat.",
  ["1001060701_67"]="So, you and I will have a final showdown.",
  ["1001060701_68"]="Just the two of us?",
  ["1001060701_69"]="Yes. If I lose, we will yield to you.",
  ["1001060701_7"]="Sensing that gaze, the figure in black pauses, looking up.",
  ["1001060701_70"]="Fine, and if you win, we will leave immediately and never return again.",
  ["1001060701_71"]="Good. It's settled then.",
  ["1001060701_72"]="Three claps of our hands to seal our pact. If either breaks it, he shall be cursed by both heaven and earth.",
  ["1001060701_73"]="Dismissing his companions, Li Jun walks up to Ji Xia.",
  ["1001060701_74"]="The two exchange a glance and raise their hands.",
  ["1001060701_75"]="*Clap* *Clap* *Clap*",
  ["1001060701_76"]="*Clap* *Clap* *Clap*",
  ["1001060701_77"]="*Clap* *Clap* *Clap*",
  ["1001060701_78"]="*Clap* *Clap* *Clap*",
  ["1001060701_79"]="The claps resound like war drums, echoing through the valley.",
  ["1001060701_8"]="I've confirmed there's only one of them, Lord of Weaponry.",
  ["1001060701_80"]="What weapon will you use? I remember breaking your sword in our last duel.",
  ["1001060701_81"]="Ji Xia unsheathes a shattered sword.",
  ["1001060701_82"]="You've got a good memory. With my clan struggling to find an intact weapon, I'm left with this half burnt stick.",
  ["1001060701_83"]="...You're quite straightforward.",
  ["1001060701_84"]="Hah, no harm in being honest with you.",
  ["1001060701_85"]="His casual demeanor, bordering on arrogance, causes Li Jun to frown in displeasure.",
  ["1001060701_86"]="We have plenty of Cerulean Crystal swords. Choose one for yourself.",
  ["1001060701_87"]="You're giving me a weapon?",
  ["1001060701_88"]="Of course. The Lord of Weaponry is not one to take advantage of his opponent's mishap.",
  ["1001060701_89"]="He returns an equally arrogant look to Ji Xia.",
  ["1001060701_9"]="This could be a trap.",
  ["1001060701_90"]="The outcome won't change regardless. If I win too easily, it will be dull for me, and you'll die without a proper fight.",
  ["1001060701_91"]="Ji Xia's smile fades, replaced by sheer excitement in his eyes.",
  ["1001060701_92"]="When Ji Xia speaks again, the authority of a chieftain fades from his voice, giving way to the raw bloodlust of a warrior.",
  ["1001060701_93"]="That'll be your last mistake, Li Jun.",
  ["1001060801_1"]="Placeholder",
  ["1001060801_10"]="After that, you must depart, and we're square.",
  ["1001060801_11"]="Mind your manners, Patriarch! If this ends up online, nobody will come to our Tianli BnB ever!",
  ["1001060801_12"]="Tianli BnB...?",
  ["1001060801_13"]="It's, well... a fresh take to showcase our cultural heritage! Let's not dwell on the details, Patriarch.",
  ["1001060801_14"]="Huh? Sounds weird... Anyway, I'm off.",
  ["1001060801_15"]="Feel free to walk around before nightfall. Dinner is on its way. The mist is thick outside, so it's best to stay indoors.",
  ["1001060801_2"]="The Tianli Clan",
  ["1001060801_3"]="Inside the ancestral mansion of the Tianli Clan.",
  ["1001060801_4"]="Intricate eaves and arches, ornately carved beams, and expansive courtyards, signal a residence fit for a distinguished family.",
  ["1001060801_5"]="Li Chi, the leader of the Tianli Clan, remains speechless.",
  ["1001060801_6"]="Having greeted us at the entrance, he appears to have lost interest in our origins or identities.",
  ["1001060801_7"]="Beyond another screen wall, a tidy courtyard unfolds, leading to a row of well-kept guest quarters at the end.",
  ["1001060801_8"]="Here we are. Make yourself at home here for the night.",
  ["1001060801_9"]="...Just let me be clear: this is a token of gratitude for saving my people. We promise your safety until the fog lifts.",
  ["1001060802_1"]="In the evening, the Tianli resident presents a lavish dinner.",
  ["1001060802_10"]="We never use water from Tianchi Lake, little girl.",
  ["1001060802_11"]="Xin widens her eyes with curiosity.",
  ["1001060802_12"]="Why is that?",
  ["1001060802_13"]="It's a tradition, like our prohibition on leaving QingYu City. It might not matter much now, but in the past, without a water supply, we had to trek far for water daily.",
  ["1001060802_14"]="That's weird. Why did your ancestors create so many weird rules?",
  ["1001060802_15"]="The resident's expression darkens once more.",
  ["1001060802_16"]="A piece of advice for you, little girl. Don't bring up that legend in front of our people.",
  ["1001060802_17"]="What, is it taboo or something?",
  ["1001060802_18"]="The legend itself is not taboo, but Ji Xia is. I know many see him as humanity's first ancestor, but we don't. We have our own ancestor, Li Jun.",
  ["1001060802_19"]="Let's set aside Li Jun's tales for now. Your tone suggests... you're not quite fond of Ji Xia, right?",
  ["1001060802_2"]="All these ingredients are from QingYu City, where the royal officials of old used to savor similar dishes. Try these traditional flavors we've rediscovered!",
  ["1001060802_20"]="No, I'm not. As for the reason... According to our lore, Ji Xia betrayed Li Jun in the past, leading to his gruesome demise.",
  ["1001060802_21"]="Really? But I thought history books painted them as close friends?",
  ["1001060802_22"]="Maybe they were friends once. But people change, you know.",
  ["1001060802_23"]="In our folklore, the first Qian dynasty was a joint effort of Ji Xia and Li Jun. Ji Xia was unable to defeat our ancestor, so he proposed ruling the world together.",
  ["1001060802_24"]="Out of trust, our patriarch Li Jun let him establish his capital on Mount Tianque, originally our territory.",
  ["1001060802_25"]="Ji Xia then turned treacherous, scheming to kill Li Jun and seize power...",
  ["1001060802_26"]="Following Li Jun's death, the Ji Clan feared the mighty Tianli Clan, leading Ji Xia and his followers to oppress us. Our people endured hardships: the strong were enslaved to build the city, and the elderly and children were mercilessly slaughtered.",
  ["1001060802_27"]="This... this is totally different from what's written in history books!",
  ["1001060802_28"]="The Ji Clan values written records while we cherish oral traditions. Over time, their records became the accepted truth, while our songs and epics got neglected.",
  ["1001060802_29"]="Well, don't take it to heart; think of it as folklore. After all, it all happened thousands of years ago, and nobody can say for sure, right? Some past stories have blurred between history and myths over time.",
  ["1001060802_3"]="Xin's eyes light up at the sight of the meal. She immediately digs in, the sounds of chewing filling the air.",
  ["1001060802_30"]="While it doesn't matter what you outsiders believe, but my clan takes our ancestral teachings seriously. So, a reminder for you: don't mention anything about Ji Xia in front of our people.",
  ["1001060802_31"]="That clarifies the \"stubborn\" aspect...",
  ["1001060802_32"]="*Gobble*... *Gobble*...",
  ["1001060802_33"]="Xin appears to tune out the conversation, gobbling down all the remaining food and licking her fingers clean.",
  ["1001060802_34"]="Do you have more?",
  ["1001060802_35"]="Xin!",
  ["1001060802_36"]="Oh, um... I'm really sorry about this. We didn't anticipate such a... hearty appetite from you. We've run out of dishes for today.",
  ["1001060802_37"]="We'll take note of this. Seems like we'll have to prepare more food when we open our restaurant...",
  ["1001060802_4"]="Watch your manners, Xin! We're guests here!",
  ["1001060802_5"]="But why bother? I'm totally starving after a day of fighting...",
  ["1001060802_6"]="Oh, these noodles have the perfect chew, and the soup tastes great! I could go for another bowl!",
  ["1001060802_7"]="Hah, we use mountain spring water to cook these noodles, ensuring top-notch quality!",
  ["1001060802_8"]="Huh? So, it's not from Tianchi Lake atop Mount Tianque? I thought...",
  ["1001060802_9"]="The resident's expression turns grim at the mention of \"Tianchi Lake.\"",
  ["1001060901_1"]="Reserved for Scene Opening",
  ["1001060901_10"]="I'm here.",
  ["1001060901_11"]="Don't you need some rest?",
  ["1001060901_12"]="Don't you need some rest?",
  ["1001060901_13"]="Yeah.",
  ["1001060901_14"]="...",
  ["1001060901_15"]="Struggling to sleep?",
  ["1001060901_16"]="Yeah, a little bit.",
  ["1001060901_17"]="Something is on my mind.",
  ["1001060901_18"]="About the back of the mountain...",
  ["1001060901_19"]="With a clap sound, Zero closes the book in her hand.",
  ["1001060901_2"]="Lone Crane Under Moon",
  ["1001060901_20"]="The moonlight is bright. Let's step outside and take a stroll.",
  ["1001060901_21"]="Understood.",
  ["1001060901_22"]="The moon, accompanied by drifting clouds, casts a bright light.",
  ["1001060901_23"]="Faint cloud shadows blend with the tree shadows on the ground.",
  ["1001060901_24"]="Among these shadows, a subtle glimmer of light appears.",
  ["1001060901_25"]="However, it is not moonlight.",
  ["1001060901_26"]="It is softer and fluffier, like...",
  ["1001060901_27"]="A feather.",
  ["1001060901_28"]="Just as I move closer, a cane blocks my path.",
  ["1001060901_29"]="What's wrong?",
  ["1001060901_3"]="The night grows darker, yet the cerulean mist lingering inside QingYu City remains unbroken. Through the mist, the moonlight takes on a rusty greenish hue reminiscent of an ancient bronze mirror.",
  ["1001060901_30"]="What's wrong?",
  ["1001060901_31"]="A soft breeze brushes my face, causing the tree shadows to dance on the ground.",
  ["1001060901_32"]="As I gaze following the breeze, the dense pines and bamboo on the mountain sway like ripples.",
  ["1001060901_33"]="Under the moonlight, a slender, graceful figure emerges within the bamboo forest.",
  ["1001060901_34"]="I can't help but hold my breath, not wanting to disturb this creature inhabiting the tranquility.",
  ["1001060901_35"]="Is it a crane? Or a heron? Whatever it is, it is undoubtedly linked to ancient songs and legends, and it is... remarkably large.",
  ["1001060901_36"]="Sensing human presence, the giant bird subtly bends its slender neck and turns.",
  ["1001060901_37"]="Its eyes gleam with a warm red hue in the moonlight, akin to fireflies or stars.",
  ["1001060901_38"]="From this distance, it is hard for anyone to discern whether its gaze is fixed on me or on Zero beside me.",
  ["1001060901_39"]="Yet, almost instinctively, I am certain that the bird's focus is undeniably on me.",
  ["1001060901_4"]="The night breeze sweeps through the towering Mount Tianque, causing the distant forest to rustle. Although usually soothing, the sound carries an eerie undertone like whispers through the mist.",
  ["1001060901_40"]="Its eyes lack the typical fear or wariness that birds often exhibit towards humans, nor do they possess the untamed ferocity of a wild animal.",
  ["1001060901_41"]="Instead, an indescribable serenity emanates from them.",
  ["1001060901_42"]="It may sound odd to describe a bird's gaze as one of \"wisdom,\" but its gaze makes me feel that way.",
  ["1001060901_43"]="Only then do I notice that the bird has only one leg, as translucent as a green crystal.",
  ["1001060901_44"]="Suddenly, another gust of wind blows, forcing me to shut my eyes from the sand.",
  ["1001060901_45"]="When the wind settles and I reopen my eyes, the mountain stands silent, with only the pines and bamboo gently swaying.",
  ["1001060901_46"]="Zero gazes at the clouds.",
  ["1001060901_47"]="Following her gaze, I notice a streak of clouds in the sky moving swiftly, disappearing from sight in an instant.",
  ["1001060901_48"]="Let's follow it.",
  ["1001060901_49"]="Zero",
  ["1001060901_5"]="I toss and turn once more, struggling to find sleep.",
  ["1001060901_6"]="The events I've encountered since arriving in Qian replay in my mind.",
  ["1001060901_7"]="(Get up from the bed.)",
  ["1001060901_8"]="Zero?",
  ["1001060901_9"]="Upon rising, I notice Zero seated by the window, paging through an ancient book in the moonlight.",
  ["1001060902_1"]="All the beasts have been repelled.",
  ["1001060902_10"]="No...",
  ["1001060902_11"]="I didn't mean to...",
  ["1001060902_12"]="...I see, you're struggling to sleep.",
  ["1001060902_13"]="Things could be worse. If you were affected like those animals and lost your marbles, I'd have to...",
  ["1001060902_14"]="The teenager pauses, then approaches a raptor that has been knocked unconscious against the wall, revealing a mix of emotions.",
  ["1001060902_15"]="The Bureau of Cultural Relics will come here for this hole in the wall... Ah, forget it, I'll have someone else handle it.",
  ["1001060902_16"]="The teenager squats down, examining the raptor's wing.",
  ["1001060902_17"]="Its feathers have turned to metal. It's amazing that it can still fly.",
  ["1001060902_18"]="You can see its mutant feathers?",
  ["1001060902_19"]="What's that supposed to mean? I'm not blind.",
  ["1001060902_2"]="The teenager sheathes his blade and turns to us, his gaze still sharp.",
  ["1001060902_20"]="And those animals, their eyes all turned green. What exactly is going on at Mount Tianque?",
  ["1001060902_21"]="Lucky for you, I'm on patrol tonight, or your safety would be in question.",
  ["1001060902_22"]="Also, while I let you stay tonight, wandering freely within my clan wasn't part of the deal.",
  ["1001060902_23"]="What are you snooping around for?",
  ["1001060902_24"]="Just as tension peaks, the boy in my arms wakes up, rubbing his eyes and hopping down.",
  ["1001060902_25"]="Hey, Brother Chi! Why are you still out at this hour?",
  ["1001060902_26"]="I could ask you the same.",
  ["1001060902_27"]="The boy dashes to Li Chi's side. Li Chi squats, gently patting the child's head, his expression becoming much more gentle.",
  ["1001060902_28"]="I was bored, so I suggested a game of hide and seek with the guests, and we ended up here...",
  ["1001060902_29"]="The child winks at me cleverly.",
  ["1001060902_3"]="Li Chi?",
  ["1001060902_30"]="...",
  ["1001060902_31"]="Suspicious at the boy's words, Li Chi is about to say something, but the boy interrupts in an innocent tone.",
  ["1001060902_32"]="What are you doing here, Brother Chi? Ah, I see! You're playing hide and seek, too!",
  ["1001060902_33"]="Nonsense. And I've told you to call me \"patriarch\" in front of outsiders.",
  ["1001060902_34"]="Come on, it's all the same! Brother Chi is the Patriarch, and the Patriarch is Brother Chi!",
  ["1001060902_35"]="...",
  ["1001060902_36"]="Fine, alright.",
  ["1001060902_37"]="Didn't your parents tell you not to sneak out at night? And playing hide and seek with our guests...",
  ["1001060902_38"]="They did, but it was so dull. You're all busy, and only they had time to play with me.",
  ["1001060902_39"]="Li Chi shoots a questioning look at us.",
  ["1001060902_4"]="Patriarch?",
  ["1001060902_40"]="...I'm sorry for the trouble.",
  ["1001060902_41"]="He then turns to the boy.",
  ["1001060902_42"]="Now's not the time for games. I'm taking you back now.",
  ["1001060902_43"]="The boy pouts.",
  ["1001060902_44"]="Please, Brother Chi! Don't tell my parents about it...",
  ["1001060902_45"]="No guarantees. Alright, time to head back.",
  ["1001060902_46"]="Li Chi rises and glances back at us, his expression much gentler.",
  ["1001060902_47"]="Come along, I'll escort you back to your rooms too. Once dawn breaks, feel free to head out on your own.",
  ["1001060902_48"]="He glances up at the night sky, muttering.",
  ["1001060902_49"]="The Big Dipper is bright... The mist is almost gone.",
  ["1001060902_5"]="Is that how outsiders address hosts nowadays?",
  ["1001060902_50"]="I can't help but gaze up at the starry sky.",
  ["1001060902_51"]="Yes, the Big Dipper is truly bright. The mist is almost cleared.",
  ["1001060902_6"]="I'm the patriarch of the Tianli Clan, not your clan.",
  ["1001060902_7"]="Well, just call me Li Chi.",
  ["1001060902_8"]="I believe my people warned you not to roam without permission.",
  ["1001060902_9"]="What's up? Too dull to sleep peacefully? Seeking thrills by trespassing our sacred lands?",
  ["1001061001_1"]="Placeholder",
  ["1001061001_10"]="What terror! What excitement! What ecstasy!",
  ["1001061001_11"]="The fire in his heart blazes fiercer, each blow growing more potent.",
  ["1001061001_12"]="Finally, a resounding clang echoes.",
  ["1001061001_13"]="<color=#000000>The sword and blade shatter simultaneously.</color>",
  ["1001061001_14"]="<color=#000000>Without hesitation, the two men drop their broken weapons and raise their fists, charging at each other.</color>",
  ["1001061001_15"]="As night descends once more, the clouds disperse, a chill permeating the air.",
  ["1001061001_16"]="The two men lie on the ground, exhausted.",
  ["1001061001_17"]="Their blood seeps into the earth beneath them. Were it not for their chests rising and falling vigorously, they could be mistaken for corpses.",
  ["1001061001_18"]="The mist dissipates, and the duel concludes.",
  ["1001061001_19"]="Hah... hah... Didn't think it would end like this.",
  ["1001061001_2"]="The Big Dipper",
  ["1001061001_20"]="Hah... heh... Ha-hahahaha..",
  ["1001061001_21"]="The bright moon hangs in the sky, stars twinkling.",
  ["1001061001_22"]="The two men gaze up at the starry sky, breaking into laughter.",
  ["1001061001_23"]="Their laughter is short-lived, giving way to grimaces as their wounds protest.",
  ["1001061001_24"]="After a while, Ji Xia steadies his breathing, quietly contemplating the starry expanse above.",
  ["1001061001_25"]="His eyes, deeper than the night, reflect the brilliant river of stars. Suddenly, he blinks, gesturing towards something as if boasting to Li Jun.",
  ["1001061001_26"]="Look, Li Jun. Check out those stars.",
  ["1001061001_27"]="Ji Xia lacks the strength to point out the star's location.",
  ["1001061001_28"]="However, the seven stars, shining brightly amidst the others, immediately capture Li Jun's attention with their moon-like radiance.",
  ["1001061001_29"]="What's that?",
  ["1001061001_3"]="In ancient texts, the account of the duel is described as almost mythical and not entirely credible.",
  ["1001061001_30"]="I call them the Big Dipper. They always point north.",
  ["1001061001_31"]="When its \"handle\" points east, it's spring; when it points south, it's summer; when it points west, it's fall; when it points north, it's winter.",
  ["1001061001_32"]="That's how I guide my people to plow in spring, farm in summer, harvest in fall, and hibernate in winter at the right times.",
  ["1001061001_33"]="They've also been leading us straight west on this journey.",
  ["1001061001_34"]="Ji Xia lets out a long sigh.",
  ["1001061001_35"]="Even for myself, it took me several years to figure out this pattern.",
  ["1001061001_36"]="...",
  ["1001061001_37"]="Li Jun ponders for a moment.",
  ["1001061001_38"]="So, you've fought your way here with this \"Big Dipper\" and your shabby weapons?",
  ["1001061001_39"]="Ji Xia chuckles.",
  ["1001061001_4"]="Nevertheless, nearly all records depict the beginning of the duel with a sudden mist.",
  ["1001061001_40"]="Speaking of weapons, who can claim to be the top weapon maker in your presence?",
  ["1001061001_41"]="Li Jun smiles with self-conceit.",
  ["1001061001_42"]="Heh, you still have that humor. Seems the Cerulean Crystal sword hasn't seen your full potential yet.",
  ["1001061001_43"]="Taking a deep breath, he rises from the ground and extends his hand to Ji Xia.",
  ["1001061001_44"]="Let's go. I'll craft you a sword worthy of your skills.",
  ["1001061001_45"]="Although Li Jun's hand still bears the wounds inflicted by Ji Xia, he disregards them.",
  ["1001061001_46"]="Watching blood dripping from Li Jun's fingertips, Ji Xia clasps it with his own blood-stained hand in return.",
  ["1001061001_47"]="Sure.",
  ["1001061001_48"]="Their blood mingles.",
  ["1001061001_49"]="Thus, with blood as their vow, their clans form an alliance beneath the Big Dipper.",
  ["1001061001_5"]="The mist on Mount Tianque lingered for three full days.",
  ["1001061001_50"]="This oath will remain unbroken. Whoever breaches it shall be cursed by heaven and earth!",
  ["1001061001_6"]="The clash of sword and blade stirred blizzards and thunderstorms.",
  ["1001061001_7"]="The duel has lasted three full days, yet the opponent shows no signs of fatigue.",
  ["1001061001_8"]="He cannot be maimed or killed. Despite enduring numerous strikes, this beast remains undaunted, aiming for the throat in the next moment.",
  ["1001061001_9"]="This is a foe who defies his best efforts.",
  ["1001061101_1"]="Placeholder",
  ["1001061101_10"]="See you later! Let's play again next time!",
  ["1001061101_11"]="We continue walking until they are out of sight.",
  ["1001061101_12"]="You didn't cause any trouble last night, did you?",
  ["1001061101_13"]="Is it just me, or did their expression turn even more sour as we were leaving?",
  ["1001061101_14"]="Hey, why are you staring at me?",
  ["1001061101_15"]="Who knows, maybe some troublemaker sneaked in and ransacked their kitchen in the dead of night...",
  ["1001061101_16"]="What did you just say?",
  ["1001061101_17"]="Oh, it's nothing! Just talking to myself!",
  ["1001061101_18"]="I do have something to ask.",
  ["1001061101_19"]="You know what?",
  ["1001061101_2"]="Reconnection",
  ["1001061101_20"]="What's on your mind, Head Librarian?",
  ["1001061101_21"]="Do cranes live on Mount Tianque?",
  ["1001061101_22"]="A crane...? Well, while there are many crane reliefs and statues in Qingyu City, they're mostly cultural relics.",
  ["1001061101_23"]="Ecologically speaking, cranes are typically found near wetlands by rivers, right? They wouldn't normally go to a high place like Mount Tianque, except during migration.",
  ["1001061101_24"]="But I saw an unusual crane last night.",
  ["1001061101_25"]="What was so unusual about it?",
  ["1001061101_26"]="It was unusually large... about this huge.",
  ["1001061101_27"]="Azi seems surprised before grinning.",
  ["1001061101_28"]="That was probably just your imagination, Head Librarian.",
  ["1001061101_29"]="How could there be a bird that huge?",
  ["1001061101_3"]="The next morning.",
  ["1001061101_30"]="By the way, what do you think of those people, Xin?",
  ["1001061101_31"]="Hmm, their noodles are super tasty!",
  ["1001061101_32"]="Noodles! You're all about food! Haven't you noticed anything unusual about those people?!",
  ["1001061101_33"]="Are you referring to their tourist scams or selling mass-produced stuff?",
  ["1001061101_34"]="Are you talking about... transcendental perception?",
  ["1001061101_35"]="Ah! That's the term one would expect from the erudite Head Librarian!",
  ["1001061101_36"]="Come on! Speak in plain language!",
  ["1001061101_37"]="Those people are extraordinary.",
  ["1001061101_38"]="She points at her own eyes.",
  ["1001061101_39"]="\"Field of vision\" refers to the limit of what the naked eye can perceive.",
  ["1001061101_4"]="The mist dissipates, and the sun ascends over QingYu City.",
  ["1001061101_40"]="For example, to explain \"red,\" the audience should understand the concept of \"colors.\"",
  ["1001061101_41"]="But those people see \"colors\" in Anomaly, which only we're supposed to see.",
  ["1001061101_42"]="Precisely! Regular folks don't see what we do.",
  ["1001061101_43"]="To them, things outside their field of vision get altered and rationalized.",
  ["1001061101_44"]="Most people see contaminated animals as greenish. They don't grasp that crystals are growing on their flesh.",
  ["1001061101_45"]="But those Tianli people perceive things as we do.",
  ["1001061101_46"]="I wonder if Master Yuanquan knows anything about this... Wait, is he being lenient with them because he's already aware of this?",
  ["1001061101_47"]="Ahh! I don't get it! Let's keep moving!",
  ["1001061101_5"]="A new day dawns. As I stand outside the abode, the street lies silent and deserted, as if yesterday's event has never occurred.",
  ["1001061101_6"]="Except...",
  ["1001061101_7"]="As I glance back, the clan's patriarch — the dominating teenager — watches us from upstairs.",
  ["1001061101_8"]="Please go. No need for a farewell.",
  ["1001061101_9"]="The resident seems about to speak, but the patriarch's gaze eventually unnerves him. He restrains his words and respectfully gestures to us in the ancient Qian style.",
  ["1001061301_1"]="Reserved for Scene Opening",
  ["1001061301_10"]="...This is incredible.",
  ["1001061301_100"]="On the other hand, some so-called \"peaceful clan\" nearly conquered the entire region and still sought to expand their domain.",
  ["1001061301_101"]="Gosh, you can be quite harsh sometimes, you know?",
  ["1001061301_102"]="Weapons made from Cerulean Crystals are incredibly sharp and shouldn't fall into the wrong hands. If not for your words... I wouldn't have brought you here.",
  ["1001061301_103"]="Confused, Ji Xia states, his eyes wide.",
  ["1001061301_104"]="Huh? What did I say?",
  ["1001061301_105"]="You... Tsk.",
  ["1001061301_106"]="You mentioned using those crystals to craft farming tools, Chieftain.",
  ["1001061301_107"]="Oh, right, that's what I mentioned...",
  ["1001061301_108"]="Ji Xia speaks as if taking it for granted.",
  ["1001061301_109"]="Imagine crafting pots with it for tastier dishes, hoes for easier plowing, and wheels for sturdier carts.",
  ["1001061301_11"]="What's wrong?",
  ["1001061301_110"]="What's so special about it that it stuck with you for so long, Lord of Weaponry?",
  ["1001061301_111"]="Li Jun is struck dumb for a moment.",
  ["1001061301_112"]="Cang Luo smiles and bows to the irritated Li Jun.",
  ["1001061301_113"]="Our Chieftain is always like this, a bit carefree. Please excuse him.",
  ["1001061301_114"]="After a long, long time... when Ji Xia recalled his past with the famous poem \"Wine and flowers in hand, a futile attempt to chase. Echoes of a lost youth in a journey's empty space,\" he retained vivid memories of the day when he climbed the mountain.",
  ["1001061301_115"]="Following Li Jun, Ji Xia occasionally glances up at the sky where wispy clouds dance in a delicate balance of light and shadow.",
  ["1001061301_116"]="The icy mountain stream swirls around his feet. The chilling touch sends a shiver through his body.",
  ["1001061301_117"]="He pauses and turns around, watching the path he has traversed, gazing back downstream.",
  ["1001061301_118"]="Inexplicably, he has a vague feeling that he should stop tracing upstream and turn back now.",
  ["1001061301_119"]="Little does he know, a life drifts like water, and when one does not turn back when they should, the opportunity is gone forever.",
  ["1001061301_12"]="The view from the mountain never used to be like this.",
  ["1001061301_120"]="The dream-like time passes and fades, like snow melting in silence.",
  ["1001061301_121"]="By the time Ji Xia snaps out of his trance, Li Jun has already stopped.",
  ["1001061301_122"]="Here we are.",
  ["1001061301_123"]="The sun is dipping low in the western sky.",
  ["1001061301_124"]="The stream alongside them has now transformed into a glistening waterfall.",
  ["1001061301_125"]="Above the waterfall stands a majestic snowy peak, overlooking a vast lake that shimmers gently in the breeze, resembling an eye gazing up at the heavens.",
  ["1001061301_126"]="Ji Xia stares at the lake, feeling entranced.",
  ["1001061301_127"]="At that moment, he has an eerie feeling that the lake is gazing back at him.",
  ["1001061301_128"]="The scenery here is truly breathtaking. What's the name of this place?",
  ["1001061301_129"]="Tianchi Lake",
  ["1001061301_13"]="Oh? How was it before?",
  ["1001061301_130"]="Tianchi Lake...",
  ["1001061301_131"]="Ji Xia savors the name for a moment.",
  ["1001061301_132"]="A great name.",
  ["1001061301_133"]="Ji Xia kneels down towards the turquoise lake, dipping his fingers into the cool surface, feeling a refreshing rush.",
  ["1001061301_134"]="From the bank to the lake's depths, the water darkens towards the center, where it turns into a deep, impenetrable greenish hue, with countless Cerulean Crystals accumulating beneath.",
  ["1001061301_135"]="These crystals take on peculiar shapes, reminiscent of living creatures' skeletons.",
  ["1001061301_136"]="Ji Xia closes his eyes. Suddenly, the snow water under his touch feels no longer cold.",
  ["1001061301_137"]="For a moment, the serene Tianchi Lake transforms into boiling blood, the Cerulean Crystals morphing into stark white bones.",
  ["1001061301_138"]="Startled, Ji Xia abruptly opens his eyes, taking several steps back, ignoring the puzzling gazes from Li Jun and Cang Luo.",
  ["1001061301_139"]="Twilight descends from the clouds, providing a panoramic view down the mountain, revealing the landscape stretching a hundred miles in all directions.",
  ["1001061301_14"]="It was cold before you came here.",
  ["1001061301_140"]="Far in the distance, the grand river flows eastward, vanishing into the distant horizon.",
  ["1001061301_141"]="Along the river, the banks are twinkled with scattered lights.",
  ["1001061301_142"]="The haunting premonition that once lingered suddenly intensifies within him.",
  ["1001061301_143"]="My clan has safeguarded this mine for generations. It was only during my reign that we began crafting weapons from it.",
  ["1001061301_144"]="Even though, we've never ventured beyond these borders.",
  ["1001061301_145"]="Weapons made from Cerulean Crystals are incredibly sharp and shouldn't fall into the wrong hands. If not for your words... I wouldn't have brought you here.",
  ["1001061301_146"]="Mostly, though there are occasional tensions.",
  ["1001061301_147"]="Adjusting to new neighbors takes time, especially with so many clans living together.",
  ["1001061301_148"]="The view from the mountain never used to be like this.",
  ["1001061301_149"]="There were no lights, and at night, all you could see were the stars and the river.",
  ["1001061301_15"]="There were no lights, and at night, all you could see were the stars and the river.",
  ["1001061301_150"]="...",
  ["1001061301_151"]="\"Why did I suddenly remember his words?\"",
  ["1001061301_152"]="Ji Xia feels a bit bewildered.",
  ["1001061301_153"]="In moments like these, his thoughts often surrender to his instincts.",
  ["1001061301_154"]="Cang Luo.",
  ["1001061301_155"]="Yes, Chieftain.",
  ["1001061301_156"]="As you see, with our people scattered across this vast region, future traffic could pose a challenge.",
  ["1001061301_157"]="It might be a good idea to establish a settlement.",
  ["1001061301_158"]="And as for where to put it... What do you think about building it on this mountain, Li Jun?",
  ["1001061301_159"]="Li Jun looks surprised, raising his eyebrows.",
  ["1001061301_16"]="Isn't it a shame to have nothing on such fertile land?",
  ["1001061301_160"]="A city here? But why?",
  ["1001061301_161"]="Why not? Don't you want our people here?",
  ["1001061301_162"]="That's not the case, but are your people okay with this? They're not used to mountain life yet.",
  ["1001061301_163"]="Why not consider building at the mountain's base? Wouldn't that be more practical...?",
  ["1001061301_164"]="Li Jun follows Ji Xia's gaze downward and stops his words.",
  ["1001061301_165"]="Atop this treacherous mountain, everything is revealed clearly in front of his eyes.",
  ["1001061301_166"]="...I see your point now.",
  ["1001061301_167"]="If conflicts arise unexpectedly between those clans...",
  ["1001061301_168"]="Unusually, Ji Xia neither agrees nor disagrees with Li Jun, just muttering to himself.",
  ["1001061301_169"]="Now that we have so many people, it's time to pause. Charging forward blindly might lead us to ruin.",
  ["1001061301_17"]="No. Back then, it was just right for us.",
  ["1001061301_170"]="Let's hold off on further exploration for now. We need to give our people time to get to know each other.",
  ["1001061301_171"]="Get to know each other, huh? Some of those clans have crossed paths with us before, and I'm sure they'll have conflicts with your people down the line.",
  ["1001061301_172"]="Well, as long as we can build a life here, this is home. Arguing at home beats arguing out there without a place to return to.",
  ["1001061301_173"]="And even if clashes happen, your people will help smooth things over, right?",
  ["1001061301_174"]="...I don't recall agreeing to be a mediator.",
  ["1001061301_175"]="Looks like I can rely on you more in the future, Lord of Weaponry!",
  ["1001061301_176"]="Hey, Cang... whatever. How did your chieftain end up like this?",
  ["1001061301_177"]="Sorry, but you better get used to him sooner rather than later.",
  ["1001061301_178"]="As they banter, a flock of white cranes fly by.",
  ["1001061301_179"]="Their claws slice through the surface, turning the lake into a shimmering spectacle.",
  ["1001061301_18"]="We Tianli people are toughened by the mountains, wilderness, and blizzards. That was the ideal scenery for us.",
  ["1001061301_180"]="An eerie hush falls over the three of them on the bank.",
  ["1001061301_181"]="In the next instant, as if an invisible force smooths out all creases between heaven and earth, the lake falls into a sudden stillness.",
  ["1001061301_182"]="It is an uncanny calmness. Even all creatures adrift on the lake appear frozen in place.",
  ["1001061301_183"]="The depths of the Tianchi Lake, previously obscured from view, become crystal clear.",
  ["1001061301_184"]="Then, a majestic presence unveils itself before them.",
  ["1001061301_185"]="Has that thing... always been there?",
  ["1001061301_186"]="Ji Xia is the first to catch his breath, pointing towards the center.",
  ["1001061301_187"]="Following his gaze, Li Jun widens his eyes in astonishment.",
  ["1001061301_188"]="Beneath the surface looms a colossal shadow.",
  ["1001061301_189"]="Shaped like a towering pillar, it plunges straight into the unfathomable depths.",
  ["1001061301_19"]="Hah, so we've disrupted your \"ideal scenery,\" I suppose?",
  ["1001061301_190"]="Its form looks rugged as if carved by crude tools, akin to the work of an unskilled artisan.",
  ["1001061301_191"]="However, its eerie contours suggest a craftsmanship beyond human touch.",
  ["1001061301_192"]="...I've visited here countless times but never noticed such a pillar before.",
  ["1001061301_193"]="In stark contrast to the tranquil beauty, the dark monolith seems like an ominous thorn piercing into the lake's eye.",
  ["1001061301_194"]="This pillar must be ancient.",
  ["1001061301_195"]="Oh? Can you determine its era of origin?",
  ["1001061301_196"]="No, I can't... It's just a hunch.",
  ["1001061301_197"]="This structure... I'm afraid it has stood here since before humanity emerged.",
  ["1001061301_198"]="The lake gleams under the setting sun.",
  ["1001061301_199"]="Wisps of cerulean hues emanate from the giant pillar, swirling like ethereal smoke.",
  ["1001061301_2"]="New Chapter",
  ["1001061301_20"]="Li Jun chuckles.",
  ["1001061301_200"]="Like ink blending into water, the lake surrounding the pillar soon takes on a metallic, cerulean hue.",
  ["1001061301_201"]="The hue continues to expand, until the color in the lake's center becomes so dense that the lake bed is obscured.",
  ["1001061301_202"]="Li Jun becomes alerted by the unusual sight, while Cang Luo steps back in fright.",
  ["1001061301_203"]="The cranes, which just landed on the opposite bank, scatter in panic.",
  ["1001061301_204"]="Only one white crane remains, akin to Ji Xia.",
  ["1001061301_205"]="Ji Xia glances at the crane and notices that one of its legs is broken, which is why it didn't fly away like its peers.",
  ["1001061301_206"]="The crane glances at the lake as if contemplating a sip, but then turns its attention to Ji Xia, tucking its beak under its wings to preen.",
  ["1001061301_207"]="Entranced by the peculiar scene, Ji Xia, as if guided by some mysterious force, bends down once more, scooping up a handful of the cerulean water.",
  ["1001061301_208"]="The water feels cool, clear, and refreshing against his palm.",
  ["1001061301_209"]="Hold on! Ji Xia...",
  ["1001061301_21"]="Hmph, that was my initial thought too, but for now... Well, it's not bad.",
  ["1001061301_210"]="However, by the time, Ji Xia has completed the entire handful in one swift motion.",
  ["1001061301_211"]="Upon opening his eyes, Ji Xia notices that the white crane on the opposite bank also takes a sip of water.",
  ["1001061301_212"]="Their gazes meet. The crane remains silent, while Ji Xia smiles at the crane before shifting his gaze towards his concerned companions.",
  ["1001061301_213"]="Don't worry, it's sweet. Good to know it's not poisoned.",
  ["1001061301_214"]="The cerulean hue in the lake begins to dissipate as Ji Xia stands up once more.",
  ["1001061301_215"]="This place is truly remarkable. Let's build our city around this lake.",
  ["1001061301_216"]="...",
  ["1001061301_217"]="...Yes, Chieftain.",
  ["1001061301_218"]="Thus, the city erected atop Mount Tianque came to be known as QingYu City, reigning over the vast land of Qian for millennia to come.",
  ["1001061301_219"]="A new chapter in Qian's illustrious history begins to unfold.",
  ["1001061301_22"]="He looks at the people working in the fields.",
  ["1001061301_220"]="\"From the East Sea, the Emperor ascended, tracing the rivers westward, securing countless victories and expanding his dominion. The Ji Clan swiftly conquered rival clans, uniting the land under the heavens' sanctioned rule in mere decades.\"",
  ["1001061301_221"]="\"Tianli Clan, renowned for their metallurgical prowess, crafted bronze wares, enhancing the people's lives with convenience. Progressing to bells and tripods, they enriched ceremonies and music, advancing education across realms.\"",
  ["1001061301_222"]="\"The Emperor directed hundreds of artisans to construct a city atop the mountains named QingYu, envisioned as the world's nucleus, a throne of supreme political authority.\"",
  ["1001061301_223"]="\"The Emperor assigned Cang Luo the role of historian, meticulously recording every detail within His realm. He christened the mountain 'Tianque,' symbolizing the heavenly court, disseminating rituals and music extensively, and named the river 'Grandeur' as the vital lifeline of His people, aiding all walks of life equally.\"",
  ["1001061301_224"]="Henceforth, the annals of history were tinged with a distinct cerulean tint.",
  ["1001061301_23"]="I've never seen a clan as large as yours. How many people do you have?",
  ["1001061301_24"]="Oh... that is a tough one. Hey, brother Cang Luo?",
  ["1001061301_25"]="Ji Xia turns and calls out to the historian trailing a few steps behind.",
  ["1001061301_26"]="How many people do we have now?",
  ["1001061301_27"]="I'm trying to calculate, but it's proving tricky. We have over 500,000 capable men and women for farming, and with the elderly and kids, the total must exceed 700,000.",
  ["1001061301_28"]="...No way! That many already?!",
  ["1001061301_29"]="I had my doubts at first as well, but based on reports from our clan and others who've joined us, that's the count.",
  ["1001061301_3"]="Several months have passed since the two clans forged an alliance.",
  ["1001061301_30"]="Just tallying up the numbers for our people used over 2,000 counting knots, enough to fill numerous carts!",
  ["1001061301_31"]="How many clans have joined us?",
  ["1001061301_32"]="It's 1,900 miles from the East Sea shores to here. A total of 147 clans, 325 families, and 864 bloodlines have united with us.",
  ["1001061301_33"]="Of course, we can't mobilize all of them, so most have remained where they were. As for our followers, roughly 200,000 people have come with us.",
  ["1001061301_34"]="...",
  ["1001061301_35"]="Wow, that's quite a crowd. Are they getting along well?",
  ["1001061301_36"]="Mostly, though there are occasional tensions.",
  ["1001061301_37"]="Adjusting to new neighbors takes time, especially with so many clans living together.",
  ["1001061301_38"]="Ji Xia pauses before making a sudden decision.",
  ["1001061301_39"]="Got it. When we get back, let everyone know we're halting our upstream journey for a good rest.",
  ["1001061301_4"]="Following the reconciliation, the once battleground swiftly transformed into a hub of prosperity.",
  ["1001061301_40"]="Ji Xia.",
  ["1001061301_41"]="Are you really the patriarch of your clan? Feels like Cang Luo is the one who actually does the management.",
  ["1001061301_42"]="That's a good one, Lord of Weaponry.",
  ["1001061301_43"]="My focus is on those details.",
  ["1001061301_44"]="For a massive clan like ours, knowing when to advance, when to pause, when to fight, and when to rest is far more critical than numbers.",
  ["1001061301_45"]="Heh, you know what? Sometimes I think brother Cang Luo might be better suited for this role. Maybe I should pass on the Chieftain title to him!",
  ["1001061301_46"]="That's a good one too, Chieftain.",
  ["1001061301_47"]="Up ahead, the field path suddenly gives way to lush weeds and overgrown bushes.",
  ["1001061301_48"]="That wraps up our newly cultivated fields for this year.",
  ["1001061301_49"]="How about plans for next year's plots? Any ideas on that?",
  ["1001061301_5"]="After the winter passed, orderly farmland emerged on the previously barren banks of the grand river.",
  ["1001061301_50"]="I've already sent people to survey the wasteland. Once that's done, we'll relocate our people there.",
  ["1001061301_51"]="How's the progress on clearing the wasteland?",
  ["1001061301_52"]="It takes around ten days for five strong laborers to clear an acre. With oxen, it might speed up, but we're short on oxen.",
  ["1001061301_53"]="Hmm, it takes three to four years for a calf to mature enough to plow, and they eat a lot of grass...",
  ["1001061301_54"]="Ji Xia turns to Li Jun.",
  ["1001061301_55"]="Li Jun, could you spare some of those miraculous crystals for the craftsmen to craft farming tools?",
  ["1001061301_56"]="Farming tools? You're planning to make hoes and plows with Cerulean Crystals?",
  ["1001061301_57"]="Yeah, we've got plenty of weapons now. If those crystals can handle enemies, they surely can handle rocks and roots just fine.",
  ["1001061301_58"]="But with our current population and land, we'll need a huge amount of tools.",
  ["1001061301_59"]="...Mind sharing how many Cerulean Crystals are left?",
  ["1001061301_6"]="The smithy from Tianli Clan now blazes on the land of Ji Clan, smoke weaving through the trails, while fishing boats shuttle back and forth along the river.",
  ["1001061301_60"]="...",
  ["1001061301_61"]="Li Jun narrows his eyes, his tone curious.",
  ["1001061301_62"]="Heh, you really want to know the number?",
  ["1001061301_63"]="Yep, but it's okay if you'd rather not say.",
  ["1001061301_64"]="Li Jun gazes at Ji Xia's clear eyes, then slowly relaxes his clenched fists.",
  ["1001061301_65"]="Well, it's about time. Follow me, I'm taking you somewhere.",
  ["1001061301_66"]="Ji Xia raises his eyebrows.",
  ["1001061301_67"]="Oh? That look says it's a fantastic spot.",
  ["1001061301_68"]="Next day, in the mountains.",
  ["1001061301_69"]="Streams gurgle in the shady woods.",
  ["1001061301_7"]="Walking together through the field paths, Li Jun and Ji Xia witness grains, typically grown only in the lower reaches of the great river, sprouting fresh shoots.",
  ["1001061301_70"]="This mountain seems endless... How much farther do we have to go?",
  ["1001061301_71"]="We're not even halfway there yet.",
  ["1001061301_72"]="Wait, hold on. You're not still bothered by our last duel, are you?",
  ["1001061301_73"]="Why bring that up now?",
  ["1001061301_74"]="Because this place seems so isolated, perfect for hiding corpses.",
  ["1001061301_75"]="Am I that devious to you? If I wanted you dead, do you think you'd still be standing here?",
  ["1001061301_76"]="Ha, ha! Fair point.",
  ["1001061301_77"]="Ji Xia stops and turns around.",
  ["1001061301_78"]="Can you keep up with us, brother Cang Luo?",
  ["1001061301_79"]="Y-yeah, I... I'll manage. Don't worry... about me!",
  ["1001061301_8"]="With new leaves unfurling, the lush fields undulate with greenery.",
  ["1001061301_80"]="Stop acting tough, brother Cang Luo. Let's take a breather.",
  ["1001061301_81"]="Th-thank you... Chieftain!",
  ["1001061301_82"]="The three of them pause beside a mountain stream. Although the sun still shines brightly, a chill creeps into the air.",
  ["1001061301_83"]="The tree cover thins compared to the base of the mountain, giving way to sporadic shrubs amidst the rocks.",
  ["1001061301_84"]="Ji Xia bends down, extending his hand not for water but to retrieve a mineral from the stream bed.",
  ["1001061301_85"]="The ore, tinged with a cerulean hue, bears an uncanny resemblance to a beast's fang.",
  ["1001061301_86"]="We've been following this path upstream, Li Jun.",
  ["1001061301_87"]="We didn't spot any Cerulean Crystals at the mountain's base.",
  ["1001061301_88"]="About five miles up, we started spotting crystal fragments among the pebbles, though they were tricky to spot.",
  ["1001061301_89"]="By the time we hit ten miles, the crystals resembled gravel.",
  ["1001061301_9"]="Soon, the two clans will embrace their first shared harvest season.",
  ["1001061301_90"]="Twenty miles in, they were larger, like pine nuts.",
  ["1001061301_91"]="And now, they're nearly the size of bird eggs.",
  ["1001061301_92"]="So, you're leading me towards the source of this stream where we might find a vein of Cerulean Crystals as well, right?",
  ["1001061301_93"]="Exactly.",
  ["1001061301_94"]="We Tianli folks aren't ones to forget kindness. You've shared your farming techniques with us, so it's only fair I share our forging methods in return.",
  ["1001061301_95"]="Ji Xia chuckles lightly.",
  ["1001061301_96"]="Now I see why your clan was reluctant to leave this mountain. If we had such a rich mine, we'd stay put too.",
  ["1001061301_97"]="Li Jun snorts derisively.",
  ["1001061301_98"]="My clan has safeguarded this mine for generations. It was only during my reign that we began crafting weapons from it.",
  ["1001061301_99"]="Even though, we've never ventured beyond these borders.",
  ["1001061401_1"]="The Meeting",
  ["1001061401_10"]="As part of C.A.V.E., we at WeiShi should have put all our efforts into aiding them.",
  ["1001061401_11"]="However, with the Cerulean Water causing havoc, we can barely spare any resources. We even had to rely on your assistance to resolve the crisis in CangLin City...",
  ["1001061401_12"]="The elder pauses, carefully examine me for a moment.",
  ["1001061401_13"]="I've received reports. While the crisis there has been resolved, it appears that you've extended the Library of Babel... or at least a part of it, into Qian's domain, Head Librarian.",
  ["1001061401_14"]="...",
  ["1001061401_15"]="What's that supposed to mean?",
  ["1001061401_16"]="Let's cut to the chase.",
  ["1001061401_17"]="According to the report, the \"time\" in CangLin City has been cut off from our main timeline and trapped in a static temporal realm.",
  ["1001061401_18"]="Given the circumstances, I believe the only factor causing this phenomenon is... you.",
  ["1001061401_19"]="Zero steps forward.",
  ["1001061401_2"]="On the banks of Tianchi Lake, atop Mount Tianque, in QingYu City.",
  ["1001061401_20"]="Master Yuanquan.",
  ["1001061401_21"]="Are you doubting our Head Librarian?",
  ["1001061401_22"]="The elder shakes his head.",
  ["1001061401_23"]="No, I believe you harbor no ill will, and I appreciate your help, even if you may not fully grasp the extent of your abilities.",
  ["1001061401_24"]="The source behind this must be an anomaly. Considering all the C.A.V.E. members present in Canglin City at that time, it's logical to attribute it to the Library of Babel.",
  ["1001061401_25"]="After all, only that enigmatic Library could exert such influence over space and time on such a grand scale.",
  ["1001061401_26"]="While the Tower of Babel has collapsed, its connection to our world appears intact.",
  ["1001061401_27"]="Once again, the elder fixes his keen gaze on me.",
  ["1001061401_28"]="Zhantan informed me that you were chosen by Cosmos, the former Head Librarian, as his successor.",
  ["1001061401_29"]="The decisions of the Eme-an sages can truly be elusive.",
  ["1001061401_3"]="An elder, as straight-backed as a pine, peers at the deep green pool, then shuts his eyes in reflection.",
  ["1001061401_30"]="Nevertheless, the detachment of CangLin City from the main timeline offers us some respite.",
  ["1001061401_31"]="I appreciate your aid and regret not being able to reciprocate at present. Once the Cerulean Water crisis is lifted, WeiShi will do everything to help in the aftermath of the Tower's collapse.",
  ["1001061401_32"]="The elder reverently bows to me. Although I am unfamiliar with Qian customs, the reactions of WeiShi members suggest it denotes great respect.",
  ["1001061401_33"]="Let's conclude the pleasantries, shall we? I believe you both must have many questions for me by now.",
  ["1001061401_34"]="Please, feel free to ask. I'm an open book.",
  ["1001061401_35"]="Who is Feng Lin exactly?",
  ["1001061401_36"]="Who exactly is the culprit behind the crisis in CangLin City?",
  ["1001061401_37"]="A complex expression crosses Yuanquan's face.",
  ["1001061401_38"]="An excellent question.",
  ["1001061401_39"]="He is known by many names. He has roamed far and wide, crossed paths with countless individuals, and left his mark on many lives.",
  ["1001061401_4"]="Upon hearing approaching steps, he opens his eyes and turns around.",
  ["1001061401_40"]="If I were to mention a few, you'd likely recognize them all.",
  ["1001061401_41"]="However, it's his original name that I believe intrigues you the most.",
  ["1001061401_42"]="Because without his deeds, we wouldn't be having this conversation now.",
  ["1001061401_43"]="Feng Lin's true identity... is the very architect of this palace, this city, and even this realm beneath our feet.",
  ["1001061401_44"]="Ji Xia, the First Emperor of Qian.",
  ["1001061401_45"]="Hold on, how is that even possible?",
  ["1001061401_46"]="He must be thousands of years old.",
  ["1001061401_47"]="Is he immortal?",
  ["1001061401_48"]="Such words might surprise coming from the head of C.A.V.E., but I understand it. It does seem too extraordinary for an outsider.",
  ["1001061401_49"]="Exactly.",
  ["1001061401_5"]="...I've been anticipating your arrival, the Head Librarian of the Library of Babel.",
  ["1001061401_50"]="Ji Xia... was the first to drink from the Cerulean Water flowing from Tianchi Lake and gain immortality.",
  ["1001061401_51"]="He has traversed epochs when only myths and legends were recorded up to our present era.",
  ["1001061401_52"]="What motivates him?",
  ["1001061401_53"]="What's his true desire?",
  ["1001061401_54"]="Another excellent question.",
  ["1001061401_55"]="But I can't claim to have all the answers.",
  ["1001061401_56"]="We're confronting an opponent whose history rivals that of Qian.",
  ["1001061401_57"]="Whatever he aims to achieve, I wouldn't be surprised by his vision.",
  ["1001061401_58"]="One thing is certain... Ji Xia is hatching grand schemes.",
  ["1001061401_59"]="Petty targets won't pique his interest or be worth the effort he has expended.",
  ["1001061401_6"]="Pleased to meet you. This old one is Yuanquan of WeiShi.",
  ["1001061401_60"]="We will do everything in our power to thwart him.",
  ["1001061401_61"]="Furthermore, our intelligence suggests that Nemesis has an Apostle known as... the Sower.",
  ["1001061401_62"]="And all clues indicate that the Sower is none other than Ji Xia himself.",
  ["1001061401_63"]="Is Ji Xia a member of Nemesis?",
  ["1001061401_64"]="Is Ji Xia taking orders from Nemesis?",
  ["1001061401_65"]="Yuanquan grins.",
  ["1001061401_66"]="Definitely not. I'm firm on this.",
  ["1001061401_67"]="To him, Nemesis, and even all humans today, are like mere children.",
  ["1001061401_68"]="Perhaps he is temporarily collaborating with Nemesis for his own ends, but swearing allegiance is out of the question.",
  ["1001061401_69"]="Nemesis is not worthy of him.",
  ["1001061401_7"]="I didn't expect the new leader of the Eme-an sages to be this young.",
  ["1001061401_70"]="Do you think what's happening in Qian is linked to the Tower of Babel?",
  ["1001061401_71"]="That requires further investigation.",
  ["1001061401_72"]="However, given C.A.V.E.'s recent setbacks in such a short span, it's hard to overlook the potential connections.",
  ["1001061401_73"]="I have a feeling... Even if we resolve the Cerulean Water crisis, Nemesis likely has other plans in motion.",
  ["1001061401_74"]="But well, that's a concern for later. Let's concentrate on the present.",
  ["1001061401_75"]="You've journeyed all the way here from CangLin City. Have you noticed anything intriguing? I'm curious to hear.",
  ["1001061401_76"]="That's a long story...",
  ["1001061401_77"]="Well, here it goes...",
  ["1001061401_78"]="Ah, so you've already met Li Chi, the patriarch of the Tianli Clan.",
  ["1001061401_79"]="You don't seem surprised.",
  ["1001061401_8"]="I was saddened to hear from Zhantan that the Tower of Babel, standing for millennia, collapsed overnight.",
  ["1001061401_80"]="You look unfazed.",
  ["1001061401_81"]="Well, we've been keeping an eye on their movements.",
  ["1001061401_82"]="Speaking of Li Chi...",
  ["1001061401_83"]="All of a sudden, the earth trembles. Cerulean waves roiling from Tianchi Lake crash onto the bank.",
  ["1001061401_84"]="What's wrong?",
  ["1001061401_85"]="An earthquake?",
  ["1001061401_86"]="Before I can finish my words, alarmed cries of birds and beasts from afar resonate through the mountains, drawing close to the summit.",
  ["1001061401_87"]="Xin! Ming!",
  ["1001061401_88"]="Protect the Head Librarian and Master Yuanquan!",
  ["1001061401_9"]="And I heard that many Eme-an were stranded in the Library, their fate uncertain.",
  ["1001061402_1"]="With the earth calmed, the once turbulent lake settles into gentle ripples.",
  ["1001061402_10"]="I see... It seems retrieving the lost kit should be our top priority now.",
  ["1001061402_11"]="Yuanquan shifts his gaze to me.",
  ["1001061402_12"]="May I ask for another favor from you, Head Librarian?",
  ["1001061402_13"]="Sure.",
  ["1001061402_14"]="Sure thing..",
  ["1001061402_15"]="But I have one more question.",
  ["1001061402_16"]="Tell me more about it.",
  ["1001061402_17"]="Does an exceptionally large crane live on Mount Tianque?",
  ["1001061402_18"]="...",
  ["1001061402_19"]="A strange question.",
  ["1001061402_2"]="...It appears the seismic activity in Mount Tianque has escalated.",
  ["1001061402_20"]="What's so strange about it?",
  ["1001061402_21"]="Well, I apologize for the confusion.",
  ["1001061402_22"]="It's not that the question itself is strange, but it's odd that you're asking it now.",
  ["1001061402_23"]="Well, it may be time to disclose those obscured details in history. It seems that the intertwined stories are finally converging together.",
  ["1001061402_24"]="Looks like I should have asked you that question another time.",
  ["1001061402_25"]="It seems like you're avoiding giving me a direct answer.",
  ["1001061402_26"]="Some things are better discussed sooner rather than later.",
  ["1001061402_27"]="Don't worry. I'll share the whole story, but it's a long one, spanning more time than I can explain in a moment.",
  ["1001061402_28"]="...",
  ["1001061402_29"]="Based on my experience...",
  ["1001061402_3"]="Swift footsteps draw near. A group of WeiShi members emerges on the path to Tianchi Lake",
  ["1001061402_30"]="If we just focus on stopping the spread of Cerulean Water...",
  ["1001061402_31"]="That won't address the root cause.",
  ["1001061402_32"]="The Beacon that triggered the Cerulean Water is the key to the crisis.",
  ["1001061402_33"]="Where exactly is it located?",
  ["1001061402_34"]="...",
  ["1001061402_35"]="I understand. Given the circumstances, it wouldn't be wise to keep anything from you...",
  ["1001061402_36"]="We are, in fact, standing right on top of the Beacon.",
  ["1001061402_37"]="He gestures once more towards the tranquil waters.",
  ["1001061402_38"]="It lies directly beneath us, at the very bottom of Tianchi Lake",
  ["1001061402_39"]="Throughout the ages, we've referred to this Beacon as the \"Dragon Pillar.\"",
  ["1001061402_4"]="Your Excellency, due to the seismic disturbances, we had to pause our repairs on the dam, and we lost a crucial supply kit during the chaos.",
  ["1001061402_40"]="I need your help in retrieving the kit, because it contains a crucial device that temporarily restricts the Beacon's influence from spreading.",
  ["1001061402_41"]="Got it.",
  ["1001061402_42"]="Let's act on this immediately.",
  ["1001061402_43"]="As for more details...",
  ["1001061402_44"]="Once everything settles...",
  ["1001061402_45"]="Promise me you'll share all your knowledge with me.",
  ["1001061402_46"]="As you wish.",
  ["1001061402_47"]="Observing the departure of the Head Librarian and Zero, Ming displays a puzzled expression.",
  ["1001061402_48"]="Master Yuanquan? This is something that Qian and we at WeiShi should handle internally.",
  ["1001061402_49"]="Why do you always involve the Head Librarian from Eme-an? That outsider doesn't even grasp the true potential of the Library's powers yet.",
  ["1001061402_5"]="How is the progress so far?",
  ["1001061402_50"]="The elder shakes his head and lets out a soft sigh.",
  ["1001061402_51"]="Well, there's much you're unaware of, Ming. In fact, the Head Librarian isn't exactly an \"outsider.\"",
  ["1001061402_52"]="Yuanquan gazes at the greenish lake and mutters, perhaps to Ming, or perhaps to himself.",
  ["1001061402_53"]="Even if we disclose these ancient secrets to the Head Librarian, I doubt the Emperor would object, given his open-mindedness.",
  ["1001061402_54"]="Ming furrows her brow, not entirely comprehending whom Yuanquan refers to as the \"Emperor.\"",
  ["1001061402_55"]="Even more perplexing: Why does Yuanquan maintain such a reverent tone when addressing the culprit of these crises?",
  ["1001061402_56"]="The giant bird the Head Librarian mentioned... Could it be...?",
  ["1001061402_57"]="Yuanquan smiles in response to Ming's question, looking up at the sky.",
  ["1001061402_58"]="Looks like you've been keeping an eye on them since they arrived.",
  ["1001061402_59"]="Alright, Ming. Follow the Head Librarian and find out what's going on with your eyes. Consider this a chance to solve that childhood mystery that's been on your mind.",
  ["1001061402_6"]="We're about 70% complete, with some temporary reinforcements in place. However, if we experience more seismic disturbances like the recent one, the risk of dam failure will skyrocket.",
  ["1001061402_7"]="The supply kit contains vital testing equipment. Without it, we won't be able to detect hidden flaws in the dam structure.",
  ["1001061402_8"]="Can we urgently request another kit?",
  ["1001061402_9"]="I'm afraid not. These devices are scarce, and the closest one is six hundred kilometers away. Even if a helicopter is dispatched now, it would take three hours. The longer we wait, the higher the risk becomes.",
  ["1001061501_1"]="Placeholder",
  ["1001061501_10"]="There's one more crucial thing we need to discuss.",
  ["1001061501_100"]="...Is this really that incredible?",
  ["1001061501_101"]="While I hate to admit it, your talent with the flute far surpasses mine as the inventor...",
  ["1001061501_102"]="Well, it's just like hunting. Practice makes perfect.",
  ["1001061501_103"]="Haha, you can keep this flute then.",
  ["1001061501_104"]="Just play it. It's rare to have some leisure time like this...",
  ["1001061501_105"]="Li Jun snorts derisively but does not decline.",
  ["1001061501_106"]="That night, the flute's melody harmonizes with the rustling pines under the moonlight, evoking what future generations would call \"the harmonious union of humanity and nature.\"",
  ["1001061501_107"]="While Li Jun plays the flute with closed eyes, Ji Xia observes several red butterflies emerging from the forest.",
  ["1001061501_108"]="The butterflies dance above the clearing, responding to the flute's melody with their fluttering movements.",
  ["1001061501_109"]="Ji Xia reclines against the cool boulder, savoring the moment with closed eyes.",
  ["1001061501_11"]="The founding of a kingdom is unprecedented. Naturally, it deserves a grand ceremony that will be etched in history.",
  ["1001061501_110"]="After numerous days of labor, the ceremonial bridge is finally finished.",
  ["1001061501_111"]="Vassals from diverse regions converge on QingYu City, ready to pay respects to the Emperor.",
  ["1001061501_112"]="The long-anticipated coronation ceremony begins.",
  ["1001061501_113"]="Observing from the vantage point of Tianchi Lake, QingYu City resembles a series of ascending tiers like long stairs on the mountainside.",
  ["1001061501_114"]="With the break of dawn, the breeze carries the sound of waves to the ears.",
  ["1001061501_115"]="A resounding trumpet blast cuts through the morning mist, signaling the start of Xia's coronation ceremony.",
  ["1001061501_116"]="Crowds line both sides of the imperial road as a carriage crafted from cerulean metal slowly traverses the streets, the aura of reverence echoing in its wake.",
  ["1001061501_117"]="Emperor! Emperor! Emperor!",
  ["1001061501_118"]="Seated inside the carriage, adorned in robe and crown, the figure sits upright. Sunlight filters through the clouds, casting a golden aura ahead of the carriage, illuminating his visage.",
  ["1001061501_119"]="Witnessing this spectacle, the subjects privileged to glimpse the Emperor's presence erupt in cheers once more.",
  ["1001061501_12"]="Yeah... fair point. I trust you to handle that, brother Cang Luo.",
  ["1001061501_120"]="Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor!",
  ["1001061501_121"]="The beaded tassels swaying from the crown slightly obstruct Ji Xia's view, imparting an ethereal quality to everything within his sight.",
  ["1001061501_122"]="He finds himself lost in thought.",
  ["1001061501_123"]="By the time he reorients himself, the carriage has reached the mountaintop. Tianchi Lake mirrors a serene surface, with a cascading waterfall nearby.",
  ["1001061501_124"]="Extending over the waterfall, a bridge stretches into the air.",
  ["1001061501_125"]="Ji Xia steps out from the carriage, his ornate accessories emitting a melodic clink of metal and jade.",
  ["1001061501_126"]="He gazes at his reflection in the water.",
  ["1001061501_127"]="Clad in his new attire, he appears almost like someone else.",
  ["1001061501_128"]="Clad in his new attire, he appears almost like someone else.",
  ["1001061501_129"]="His subjects around the lake similarly don garments, distinct from their usual attire.",
  ["1001061501_13"]="Yes, Chieftain.",
  ["1001061501_130"]="Fabric replaces animal skin, silk supplants hemp rope, and jade pendants substitute bone jewelry.",
  ["1001061501_131"]="The sleeves should be rounded while the curved linings should be square shaped. The ropes should be straight, and the lower hemline should maintain a consistent length.",
  ["1001061501_132"]="The elegance of attire aligns with the customs of the grand kingdom known as Xia, embodying the principle of attire and adherence to societal norms.",
  ["1001061501_133"]="Ji Xia proceeds towards the bridge, receiving bows and salutes from all attendees.",
  ["1001061501_134"]="For the first time, this land witnesses such a convergence of people, each engaged in their respective endeavors.",
  ["1001061501_135"]="Consequently, the newly established kingdom requires numerous departments to aid the Emperor.",
  ["1001061501_136"]="The realm now boasts new branches for agriculture, education, legal affairs, enforcement, craftsmanship, ceremonies, animal husbandry, arts, literature, counsel, and various others.",
  ["1001061501_137"]="Cang Luo has diligently overseen this process, scrutinizing all departments and appointing the most capable individuals, culminating in the selection of the ministers now gathered before Ji Xia.",
  ["1001061501_138"]="Ji Xia's gaze scans over his ministers, met with expressions of curiosity, awe, and anticipation from them.",
  ["1001061501_139"]="They all perceive a significant and profound transformation unfolding across this expansive land, privileged to witness it firsthand.",
  ["1001061501_14"]="By the way, are you still calling Ji Xia as your \"chieftain\"?",
  ["1001061501_140"]="Several dozen individuals stand not among the ministers but at the start of the bridge, awaiting Ji Xia's approach.",
  ["1001061501_141"]="These are familiar faces to Ji Xia, formerly leaders of clans now referred to as \"vassals.\"",
  ["1001061501_142"]="Their territories have been organized into domains, with the Emperor as their common sovereign.",
  ["1001061501_143"]="As Ji Xia approaches, the vassals salute, observing him ascend the bridge over the waterfall.",
  ["1001061501_144"]="Alone, he pauses at the bridge's midpoint.",
  ["1001061501_145"]="Wispy clouds drift beneath the bridge, blending with mist to form a pale white veil.",
  ["1001061501_146"]="Beneath this veil lies a vast expanse of green, with mountains and grasslands extending endlessly into the distance.",
  ["1001061501_147"]="Music fills the air as officials on the opposite bank of the Heavenly Pond play bells and chimes, engaging in singing and dancing.",
  ["1001061501_148"]="On this sacred day, time divine. Honoring the Emperor, a solemn shrine.",
  ["1001061501_149"]="Amidst the melodious song, Ji Xia reverently bows to the heavens and earth.",
  ["1001061501_15"]="Unifying the world like this is no small feat. Whoever achieves that deserves a grander title.",
  ["1001061501_150"]="<color=#000000>In Qian, the coronation ceremony is akin to a grand ritual, paying homage to heaven and earth.</color>",
  ["1001061501_151"]="In Qian, the coronation ceremony is akin to a grand ritual, paying homage to heaven and earth.",
  ["1001061501_152"]="Henceforth, such a grand ritual can only be overseen by the Emperor.",
  ["1001061501_154"]="As the melody continued, a few birds passed by, and a lone one-legged crane gracefully descended on the far end of the long bridge.",
  ["1001061501_155"]="*Clank* *Clank* *Clank* *Clank*",
  ["1001061501_156"]="At the square's center, a heavy copper bell tolls. Its chime reverberates far and wide, reaching the encompassing mountains.",
  ["1001061501_157"]="The music transitions into a somber, mournful melody, as if honoring the deceased.",
  ["1001061501_158"]="Ji Xia bows once more, this time in reverence to the courageous warriors who fell defending the living.",
  ["1001061501_159"]="<color=#000000>In valor's embrace, martyrs stand tall. Unyielding in strength, they heed the call.</color>",
  ["1001061501_16"]="Like a grand title such as \"Lord of Weaponry\", perhaps?",
  ["1001061501_160"]="In the realm beyond, martyrs' valor sings, Eternal heroes, where honor clings.",
  ["1001061501_161"]="Upon Ji Xia's rise, the bell tolls once more, the song regaining its clarity.",
  ["1001061501_162"]="<color=#000000>Drums echo solemnly, the ritual complete. Flowers exchanged in a dance so sweet.</color>",
  ["1001061501_163"]="Orchids bloom in spring, chrysanthemums in fall. An eternal cycle, a timeless call!",
  ["1001061501_164"]="The Emperor administers vast territories, vassals oversee expansive regions, ministers preside over districts, and officials manage localities. The Emperor commands legions of soldiers, vassals lead battalions, ministers oversee companies, and officials direct squads.",
  ["1001061501_165"]="Vassals pay homage to the Emperor annually, ministers visit vassals monthly, and officials report to ministers daily.The Emperor's entourage includes six horses for the carriage, dining on nine tripods and eight plates, and directing eight rows of dancers.",
  ["1001061501_166"]="Vassals are allocated four horses for the carriage, dine on seven tripods and six plates, and oversee six rows of dancers. Ministers are granted two horses for transportation, dine on five tripods and four plates, and supervise four rows of dancers. Officials are entitled to one horse for conveyance, dine on three tripods and two plates, and lead two rows of dancers.",
  ["1001061501_17"]="Absolutely.",
  ["1001061501_18"]="To be honest, I've been thinking about that recently.",
  ["1001061501_19"]="But none of the existing titles seem befitting for this momentous occasion.",
  ["1001061501_2"]="Heart of the World",
  ["1001061501_20"]="Therefore, I've come up with a new term.",
  ["1001061501_21"]="Cang Luo swiftly inscribes marks in the soft soil.",
  ["1001061501_22"]="For generations to come, this term epitomizes the ruler of all living beings under heaven.",
  ["1001061501_23"]="\"Emperor.\"",
  ["1001061501_24"]="A few days later, on the bank of Tianchi Lake",
  ["1001061501_25"]="Emperor, I've already sent messages to inform all clans about the grand establishment of Xia.",
  ["1001061501_26"]="I've also planned out the appropriate ceremonies, rules, dances, and music.",
  ["1001061501_27"]="The Tianli craftsmen are working day and night, making tripods, utensils, bells, chimes, and other ceremonial and musical instruments using Cerulean Crystals.",
  ["1001061501_28"]="And... please take this as well.",
  ["1001061501_29"]="Cang Luo presents an object with both hands. Ji Xia examines it: a small seal made of exquisite jade, fitting in one's palm. The carving carries an air of antiquity, radiating strength and authority.",
  ["1001061501_3"]="All monarchs bowed, kingdom melded as one. Atop Mount Tianque gleams QingYu, the sun.",
  ["1001061501_30"]="Cang Luo turns the seal around, revealing four engraved words, \"Heart of the World.\"",
  ["1001061501_31"]="What's this?",
  ["1001061501_32"]="This jade seal is now the Emperor's official seal and token.",
  ["1001061501_33"]="To prevent fake decrees, all decrees sent from QingYu City must carry this seal from now on.",
  ["1001061501_34"]="Calling QingYu City the \"Heart of the World\" signifies it as Xia's heart, with the Emperor as the heart of this city. The Emperor's seal is the only thing deserving of these words.",
  ["1001061501_35"]="I've drafted the first imperial decree, focusing on the kingdom's basic rules. Please review it, and if it meets your approval, I'll get it sent out.",
  ["1001061501_36"]="Cang Luo hands Ji Xia a set of bamboo slips, which Ji Xia reads through meticulously.",
  ["1001061501_37"]="The \"Emperor\" presides over the realm. \"Vassals\" govern regions. \"Ministers\" lend support to the vassals. \"Officials\" assist the ministers. All others are recognized as \"Commoners.\"The Emperor administers vast territories, vassals oversee expansive regions, ministers preside over districts, and officials manage localities.The Emperor commands legions of soldiers, vassals lead battalions, ministers oversee companies, and officials direct squads.Vassals pay homage to the Emperor annually, ministers visit vassals monthly, and officials report to ministers daily.The Emperor's entourage includes six horses for the carriage, dining on nine tripods and eight plates, and directing eight rows of dancers.

Ministers are granted two horses for transportation, dine on five tripods and four plates, and supervise four rows of dancers. Officials are entitled to one horse for conveyance, dine on three tripods and two plates, and lead two rows of dancers.",
  ["1001061501_38"]="All these details outline a new system of governance and structure.",
  ["1001061501_39"]="Brother Cang Luo, is this getting a bit... too complicated?",
  ["1001061501_4"]="After years of labor by numerous artisans, QingYu City finally took shape.",
  ["1001061501_40"]="Please address me by my name from now on, Your Majesty.",
  ["1001061501_41"]="You're not just the chieftain of the Ji Clan anymore.",
  ["1001061501_42"]="While these laws and regulations might seem a bit complex, they're crucial for bringing our people together.",
  ["1001061501_43"]="Even as the Emperor, you're bound by these laws and regulations.",
  ["1001061501_44"]="No one should cross these boundaries. It's key to maintaining peace within the kingdom.",
  ["1001061501_45"]="Ji Xia closes his eyes and reflects for a moment.",
  ["1001061501_46"]="I understand.",
  ["1001061501_47"]="But this decree doesn't cover much about the commoners.",
  ["1001061501_48"]="If vassals clash, ministers strive for power, and officials deceive, how can the commoners safeguard their lives?",
  ["1001061501_49"]="What's your idea on this, Your Majesty?",
  ["1001061501_5"]="Under Mount Tianque, Ji Xia and Li Jun walk by the river together, with Cang Luo standing behind them.",
  ["1001061501_50"]="Let's include another clause.",
  ["1001061501_51"]="Starting today, all weapons must be set aside, and any conquests or conflicts need the Emperor's approval. Vassals, ministers, and officials are not allowed to wage wars or harm the commoners.",
  ["1001061501_52"]="If the commoners have grievances, they should be able to report them to officials, ministers, vassals, and eventually, the Emperor.",
  ["1001061501_53"]="I understand, but respectfully, it might not be easy for the commoners' voices to reach the Emperor.",
  ["1001061501_54"]="It might be a challenge to put into action, but it needs to be clearly stated. If we silence the commoners, won't they forever look up to the powerful without a chance to voice their concerns?",
  ["1001061501_55"]="Of course, Your Majesty. I'll make sure to send out a decree to all the vassals.",
  ["1001061501_56"]="In addition, about the date for the ceremony, we need your opinion on this. Our kingdom is vast, and some of the vassals coming from far-off lands might take months to get to QingYu City.",
  ["1001061501_57"]="Also, we'll need to find a location to set up the observatory. What's your idea on this, Your Majesty?",
  ["1001061501_58"]="You can estimate when the vassals might arrive and pick a suitable date. And as for the observatory...",
  ["1001061501_59"]="Ji Xia's gaze wanders over the serene waters of Tianchi Lake, settling on the cascading waterfall.",
  ["1001061501_6"]="So, our dynasty will be known as \"Xia,\" right? I understand. This name will soon echo far and wide.",
  ["1001061501_60"]="We'll build a bridge over that waterfall.",
  ["1001061501_61"]="The palace is too far away from the common people.",
  ["1001061501_62"]="If the Emperor always stays inside the palace, how can they truly grasp and rule over the kingdom?",
  ["1001061501_63"]="If we build a bridge on the Lake, the Emperor will be able to see the people, and vice versa.",
  ["1001061501_64"]="I'll get the artisans on it right away.",
  ["1001061501_65"]="That evening, somewhere on Mount Tianque.",
  ["1001061501_66"]="The bright moon filters through the pine trees, casting a peaceful glow on the clear springs.",
  ["1001061501_67"]="The mountain breeze rustles through the pines, creating a gentle harmony.",
  ["1001061501_68"]="In the forest stood a one-legged crane, its head nestled under its own feathers, eyes peacefully shut.",
  ["1001061501_69"]="Amidst the soothing sounds of nature, a sharp, discordant chirp suddenly cuts through the air.",
  ["1001061501_7"]="The artisans have finished building the new city, by the way.",
  ["1001061501_70"]="*Squeak*...",
  ["1001061501_71"]="The chirping momentarily falters with a soft exhale, then resumes its piercing tune.",
  ["1001061501_72"]="*Squeak*...",
  ["1001061501_73"]="The tune shifts but remains discordant.",
  ["1001061501_74"]="Despite this, the resting crane only gave a slight flutter of its wings, showing no concern.",
  ["1001061501_75"]="...Cang Luo has been searching high and low for you. So, you're here for some peace and quiet?",
  ["1001061501_76"]="Ji Xia sits on a rock surrounded by moonlit pines. At the sight of Li Jun's arrival, he offers a wry smile.",
  ["1001061501_77"]="Seriously, I never imagined that being a ruler would be this much of a hassle.",
  ["1001061501_78"]="It's just one thing after another, a never-ending cycle. If Cang Luo wasn't sharing half the burden, I'd probably die from exhaustion at the desk.",
  ["1001061501_79"]="Staring at those bamboo scrolls pouring in all day can drive anyone crazy. So, cut me some slack, alright? I need a breather now and then.",
  ["1001061501_8"]="Then it's time for our people to move in.",
  ["1001061501_80"]="Well, Cang Luo did send me to fetch you back, but since you're asking... I'll let you off the hook this time.",
  ["1001061501_81"]="Keep stressing, and even the most resilient bowstring will snap.",
  ["1001061501_82"]="Yeah... thank you, Lord of Weaponry.",
  ["1001061501_83"]="Ji Xia raises a slender bamboo to his lips, and the dissonant chirp reverberates through the forest once more.",
  ["1001061501_84"]="Li Jun instinctively covers his ears.",
  ["1001061501_85"]="Stop it! What on earth is that noise?!",
  ["1001061501_86"]="Ji Xia lowers his hand, grimacing.",
  ["1001061501_87"]="Ah, still not working, I see.",
  ["1001061501_88"]="It's just a little something I put together from bamboo after seeing Cang Luo's new musical instruments.",
  ["1001061501_89"]="I've named it a \"flute.\"",
  ["1001061501_9"]="Sure.",
  ["1001061501_90"]="...Is it supposed to make those terrible noises like you did?",
  ["1001061501_91"]="No, I just haven't quite figured out how to play it yet! Musicians use instruments like this with holes too. I just need to master the technique...",
  ["1001061501_92"]="Li Jun casts a dismissive glance but reaches out to Ji Xia.",
  ["1001061501_93"]="Let me have a try.",
  ["1001061501_94"]="Huh? You know how to play a flute?",
  ["1001061501_95"]="No, but back in my clan, we used to make whistles out of leaves. Your flute feels a bit like that.",
  ["1001061501_96"]="Ji Xia passes the flute to Li Jun, who is initially awkward with such a delicate instrument but quickly adapts, positioning his fingers over the holes.",
  ["1001061501_97"]="After a few attempts, Li Jun closes his eyes and begins to play.",
  ["1001061501_98"]="...",
  ["1001061501_99"]="When he opens his eyes again, he looks at Ji Xia in astonishment.",
  ["1001061601_1"]="Reserved",
  ["1001061601_10"]="Ever since Ji Xia established this as the capital, all successive emperors had deemed the Tianchi Lake a forbidden domain.",
  ["1001061601_11"]="They believed the water here could grant immortality and must be kept away from the commoners.",
  ["1001061601_12"]="The name of the original dam builder has faded with time, but historical records tell of how subsequent emperors reinforced the dam, separating royal residences from common dwellings.",
  ["1001061601_13"]="This dam has stood strong for millennia. The ancient engineering truly is remarkable...",
  ["1001061601_2"]="Tianchi Lake Dam",
  ["1001061601_4"]="Below Tianchi Lake",
  ["1001061601_5"]="Following the WeiShi members, I arrive at this grand lake. Gazing upward, a towering dam stands at the lake's edges, impeding the water's flow.",
  ["1001061601_6"]="Damaged by seismic tremors, the dam has been hastily reinforced by the WeiShi members, yet cracks are still visible in its structure.",
  ["1001061601_7"]="Sections of the dam's exterior at the highest point have been breached, revealing the massive cerulean stones within.",
  ["1001061601_8"]="Turning as footsteps approach from behind, I notice Ming, Azi, and others hurrying in this direction.",
  ["1001061601_9"]="This here is the ancient Tianchi Lake Dam.",
  ["1001061602_10"]="Huh? You're not sure what to do? Oh, sorry. I forgot to share the details.",
  ["1001061602_11"]="While the Beacon's activation is beyond control, the spread of Cerulean Water is caused by the anomaly from the Beacon.",
  ["1001061602_12"]="Therefore, physical separation is the most effective solution.",
  ["1001061602_13"]="Whether by sealing the sluice gates or using this sarcophagus, it is the most straightforward approach to prevent the pollution from spreading.",
  ["1001061602_14"]="Soon, you'll witness it yourself. We will contain the Beacon in a specialized cylindrical sarcophagus to separate it from the lake water.",
  ["1001061602_15"]="This sarcophagus incorporates Delphic Oracle's technology and was delivered from Delphi two days ago. The stone inside is the key to activating it.",
  ["1001061602_16"]="...",
  ["1001061602_17"]="What's on your mind, Zero?",
  ["1001061602_18"]="This all seems a bit too simple, doesn't it?",
  ["1001061602_19"]="Placing the Beacon inside the sarcophagus, and its impact will cease...",
  ["1001061602_2"]="Hmm, two flaw detection devices, two portable generators, and various project components...",
  ["1001061602_20"]="This is a bit too convenient.",
  ["1001061602_21"]="Feng Lin... I mean, Ji Xia has vanished since he left CangLin City.",
  ["1001061602_22"]="He's shrewd and cunning.",
  ["1001061602_23"]="It's strange how his presence is absent here, in QingYu City.",
  ["1001061602_24"]="As soon as the words leaves my mouth, a sense of unease creeps in.",
  ["1001061602_25"]="A vivid memory from the previous night flashes through my mind.",
  ["1001061602_26"]="The image of that lone crane under the moonlight resurfaces.",
  ["1001061602_27"]="To be honest, I've been thinking about it since last night.",
  ["1001061602_28"]="Azi's words interrupt my thoughts.",
  ["1001061602_29"]="If I were him, I'd have acted ages ago. Yet here we are, battling the water's spread while he lounges around.",
  ["1001061602_3"]="Good, the contents match Master Yuanquan's list.",
  ["1001061602_30"]="All the enemies we've faced so far are those mindless beasts, driven purely by instinct.",
  ["1001061602_31"]="I can't discern a pattern or purpose to any of this, like it's all one big chaotic mess without a mastermind behind it.",
  ["1001061602_32"]="What are you talking about? Sounds pretty complicated!",
  ["1001061602_33"]="Sometimes I envy your innocence, Xin. How do you keep your head so clear?",
  ["1001061602_34"]="Hey, I'm onto you! You must be badmouthing me.",
  ["1001061602_35"]="Ignoring the bickering pair, Ming directs an inquiring gaze in my direction.",
  ["1001061602_36"]="What do you think about this, Head Librarian of Eme-an?",
  ["1001061602_37"]="Ji Xia is definitely up to something.",
  ["1001061602_38"]="We've got to be careful.",
  ["1001061602_39"]="Agreed. Vigilance is key.",
  ["1001061602_40"]="Let's head back now. With the detection device, the repairing work can resume.",
  ["1001061602_41"]="While heading back to Tianchi Lake, I notice the exposed \"scar\" atop the dam, revealing cerulean stones.",
  ["1001061602_42"]="Among the stones, remnants of ancient wooden structures are visible, weathered over millennia. Blackened and decayed, they barely lean against the boulders, having long ceased to provide support.",
  ["1001061602_43"]="So, if this dam was actually a bridge...",
  ["1001061602_44"]="Overhearing my murmurs, Ming reacts.",
  ["1001061602_45"]="I understand your thoughts. I've pondered the same thing.",
  ["1001061602_46"]="If this dam was indeed once a bridge, it suggests Tianchi Lake's water used to flow freely, accessible to all.",
  ["1001061602_47"]="Something significant must have shifted. A certain dynasty likely altered the rules, setting up barriers for rites and ceremonies...",
  ["1001061602_48"]="An unsettling idea begins to take hold of me, enveloped by a foreboding sensation.",
  ["1001061602_49"]="What if, in a distant era, the Beacon within the Heavenly Pond was activated, unleashing a continuous flow of Cerulean Water?",
  ["1001061602_5"]="But what exactly are these components? They look like they were sculpted from stone!",
  ["1001061602_50"]="If so, the purpose of the dam was not merely to stop the water from flowing out...",
  ["1001061602_51"]="But also to prevent the leakage of power.",
  ["1001061602_52"]="Once the dam was constructed, the inhabitants inside and outside the palace would gradually evolve into different beings over time.",
  ["1001061602_53"]="Azi",
  ["1001061602_54"]="Xin.",
  ["1001061602_55"]="Ming",
  ["1001061602_56"]="Zero",
  ["1001061602_6"]="And what are these stones meant for?",
  ["1001061602_8"]="These \"stones\" are intended for sealing off the Beacon.",
  ["1001061602_9"]="How should we seal off the Beacon with these... stones?",
  ["1001061701_1"]="Reserved",
  ["1001061701_10"]="So engrossed in the sight, he begins to mutter unconsciously.",
  ["1001061701_11"]="This world...",
  ["1001061701_12"]="Breaking the prolonged silence, Li Jun eventually speaks.",
  ["1001061701_13"]="Ji Xia.",
  ["1001061701_14"]="Ji Xia is abruptly snapped out of his reverie, his expression mirroring that of someone abruptly roused from a dream.",
  ["1001061701_15"]="Are you thinking about... leaving?",
  ["1001061701_16"]="Ji Xia remains silent for a moment before uttering slowly.",
  ["1001061701_17"]="Long ago, I heard tales from certain clans about a colossal mountain in the far west named Kunlun, where pillars support the sky.",
  ["1001061701_18"]="Some claimed the land where the sun sets is a dark, lightless sea called Yuyuan, marking the world's end.",
  ["1001061701_19"]="Others believed the world has no bounds, as the great river connects to the Milky Way, flowing endlessly from the sky. If you travel upstream, one day you'll reach the stars.",
  ["1001061701_2"]="Burdens of the Kingdom",
  ["1001061701_20"]="...",
  ["1001061701_21"]="Well, it's about time. I should head back for business.",
  ["1001061701_22"]="...Why are you standing there?",
  ["1001061701_23"]="Li Jun fixes an intense gaze on Ji Xia.",
  ["1001061701_24"]="What does \"business\" mean to you?",
  ["1001061701_25"]="Is it about meetings, rituals, or feasts?",
  ["1001061701_26"]="...",
  ["1001061701_27"]="You're free to leave.",
  ["1001061701_28"]="...",
  ["1001061701_29"]="I said, you're free to leave.",
  ["1001061701_3"]="Time swiftly passes, and the long summer returns once again.",
  ["1001061701_30"]="But I am leaving. I'm returning to the Imperial Pavilion, you know?",
  ["1001061701_31"]="Li Jun shakes his head.",
  ["1001061701_32"]="I mean, you're free to leave QingYu City.",
  ["1001061701_33"]="What? Hah, you're not taking my words seriously, are you?",
  ["1001061701_34"]="I am serious.",
  ["1001061701_35"]="I've been watching you these years, and you know what I see? You've worn out.",
  ["1001061701_36"]="...",
  ["1001061701_37"]="I've seen the real you.",
  ["1001061701_38"]="Remember back when you scaled that mountain solo and faced me head-on? There was a spark in your eyes... a spark I haven't seen in years.",
  ["1001061701_39"]="You've been handling your duties well, flawlessly even.",
  ["1001061701_4"]="By the shores of Tianchi Lake, the single white crane, separate from its flock, stayed near the water, occasionally dipping in the ripples and grooming its feathers.",
  ["1001061701_40"]="You brought together countless tribes to form a grand kingdom. Now, this realm has weathered its initial storms and is following the path you and Cang Luo envisioned.",
  ["1001061701_41"]="You've harnessed this \"world,\" guiding its people forward. Now that it's in motion, let it carry on its momentum. You don't have to tightly grip the reins all the time, do you?",
  ["1001061701_42"]="If you're thinking of setting off on your journey, the time is now.",
  ["1001061701_43"]="Weariness evident in his furrowed brow, Ji Xia's shoulders slump.",
  ["1001061701_44"]="You're right.",
  ["1001061701_45"]="Being the Emperor... it's truly exhausting, but who else can bear this weight?",
  ["1001061701_46"]="I can't just unload all the responsibilities onto Cang Luo, can I?",
  ["1001061701_47"]="He can't handle all the political complexities alone. Moreover, if the Emperor vanishes, the kingdom is likely to plunge into chaos, with vassals possibly vying for power or the throne. In that case, all the work I've put in would go to waste.",
  ["1001061701_48"]="...What if someone were to take your place?",
  ["1001061701_49"]="Take my place?",
  ["1001061701_5"]="Positioned at the center of the Taihe Bridge spanning the waterfall, two figures stand in close proximity.",
  ["1001061701_50"]="Exactly. You're free to leave this city. I'll manage the rest.",
  ["1001061701_51"]="Ji Xia regards Li Jun with sheer disbelief.",
  ["1001061701_52"]="You?",
  ["1001061701_53"]="You mean, you want to help me govern the kingdom?",
  ["1001061701_54"]="Don't act so surprised. I've been observing you and Cang Luo maneuver through the court for years. I believe I can do just fine.",
  ["1001061701_55"]="Besides, I'm not a lonely emperor like you. When I feel weary and bored, my family will step in and lend a hand.",
  ["1001061701_56"]="The mention of his family softens Li Jun's typically cold demeanor, eliciting a wry smile from Ji Xia.",
  ["1001061701_57"]="A lonely emperor... that stings, you know? I was just too occupied to spare any moments...",
  ["1001061701_58"]="If you stay here, you'll never be able to spare any moments.",
  ["1001061701_59"]="But if that's your desire, so be it. When you tire yourself out, I'll have the finest Tianli artisans craft a magnificent tombstone for you.",
  ["1001061701_6"]="Things have been pretty calm lately.",
  ["1001061701_60"]="Redirecting his gaze towards the distant horizon, Ji Xia's vision appears to soar over the mountains and rivers, racing towards the world's boundary.",
  ["1001061701_61"]="Gradually, his expression regains its solemnity.",
  ["1001061701_62"]="Li Jun, the Lord of Weapons.",
  ["1001061701_63"]="Will you vow to serve as regent and stand in for the Emperor?",
  ["1001061701_64"]="Will you vow to be just and faithful?",
  ["1001061701_65"]="Will you vow to give your all for the people of Xia?",
  ["1001061701_66"]="...",
  ["1001061701_67"]="I will.",
  ["1001061701_68"]="By the honor of the Lord of Weapons, I will honor the Emperor's trust.",
  ["1001061701_69"]="The Tianli Clan and I will never leave QingYu City. We will give our all for Xia... No, for all the people in the world.",
  ["1001061701_7"]="You're only saying that because Cang Luo's handling all the paperwork for you, right?",
  ["1001061701_70"]="After a while, the crane near the pool raised its head, quietly watching the pair on the opposite shore.",
  ["1001061701_71"]="The two men share a momentary gaze. Ji Xia then takes a step back and offers a slight bow.",
  ["1001061701_72"]="An emperor carries the kingdom's burdens and shoulders the grievances of all its people.",
  ["1001061701_73"]="Now, I pass the mantle of governance to you, and you will face many challenges in the days ahead.",
  ["1001061701_74"]="Li Jun gestures with his hand.",
  ["1001061701_75"]="Alright, Ji Xia. Let's just stop here, okay?",
  ["1001061701_76"]="This formality is starting to feel a bit too much, don't you think?",
  ["1001061701_77"]="Ji Xia straightens up, flashing another smile.",
  ["1001061701_78"]="Haha, I'm just doing my part to the fullest so I can pass all the burdens to you with a clear conscience.",
  ["1001061701_79"]="You have no clue about the mess I've just handed you, but hey, no turning back now!",
  ["1001061701_8"]="Ahaha.... It's rare to have a laid-back day like this. Let's keep it pleasant.",
  ["1001061701_80"]="It's alright.",
  ["1001061701_81"]="Carry on your journey, Ji Xia.",
  ["1001061701_82"]="Go explore the uncharted corners of the world. To the source of the river, to the land where the sun sets.",
  ["1001061701_83"]="Five days later, the Emperor convenes all the officials for a grand court session.",
  ["1001061701_84"]="By royal decree, the presence of Li Jun, the patriarch of the Tianli Clan, is mandated.",
  ["1001061701_85"]="Amidst the perplexed expressions of the gathered officials, Li Jun ascends the steps leading to the throne, halting in front of Ji Xia and Cang Luo, who hold the decree.",
  ["1001061701_86"]="Henceforth, you shall assume the role of regent, Li Jun. You are vested with complete authority to oversee all governmental matters. Your directives are to be followed without hesitation!",
  ["1001061701_87"]="Chaos erupts in the room, but Ji Xia rises to his feet, quieting the commotion.",
  ["1001061701_88"]="Extend your hand, Li Jun, the Lord of Weaponry.",
  ["1001061701_89"]="In full view of all present, Ji Xia places a seal in Li Jun's hand, an exact replica of the Emperor's seal.",
  ["1001061701_9"]="The two fall into a momentary silence, looking over the vast land beneath Mount Tianque. Ji Xia's gaze wanders over the city, the wilderness, and the great river, stretching to the horizon's edge.",
  ["1001061701_90"]="This seal, crafted by Historian Cang Luo, mirrors the Emperor's seal and symbolizes the regent's authority. Engraved with the inscription \"Justice of the World,\" its bearer is entrusted to uphold righteousness, exercising the Emperor's power as if His Majesty were present!",
  ["1001061701_91"]="The profound changes within the royal palace resonate like a ripple, with the most significant impact felt at the core. However, it will take time for this ripple to reach distant shores.",
  ["1001061701_92"]="On that day, with the sun still high in the sky and citizens engrossed in animated discussions, Ji Xia, the First Emperor, leaves the city secretly, embarking on a journey.",
  ["1001061701_93"]="Just as Ji Xia steps out of Mount Tianque, the long-dormant Tianchi Lake...",
  ["1001061701_94"]="Opens its \"eyes\" once more.",
  ["1001061701_95"]="Ji Xia",
  ["1001061701_96"]="Li Jun",
  ["1001061701_97"]="Cang Luo",
  ["1001061801_1"]="Li Chi",
  ["1001061801_10"]="Enough! You're more than capable of handling those beasts! Just stop bickering and focus on the fight!",
  ["1001061801_11"]="Ah, forget it! Quiet down and take your children back to your quarters! No more talks! I'll handle this on my own!",
  ["1001061801_2"]="Earlier, within the Tianli ancestral mansion on the mountain's opposite side.",
  ["1001061801_3"]="Following the earthquake, startled beasts flee from the woods, converging towards the Tianli ancestral mansion.",
  ["1001061801_4"]="Proficient in martial arts, all members of the Tianli Clan, regardless of age, wield various weapons. The clash of metal echoes continuously within the mansion, blending with feral roars from the invading beasts.",
  ["1001061801_5"]="Amidst the chaos, overly exaggerated cries for help pierce through the turmoil.",
  ["1001061801_6"]="Patriarch! Please, we need your help! Beasts are attacking from the east! I want to live to see my son's wedding!",
  ["1001061801_7"]="Oh, come on! Your son is just eight! We need you more in the northeast, Patriarch! Those walls are about to collapse!",
  ["1001061801_8"]="That's nonsense! Aren't you guarding the treasury? It's been the most fortified place for two centuries!",
  ["1001061801_9"]="If the treasury falls, we're all in trouble, Patriarch! And you'll be saying goodbye to your pocket money!",
  ["1001061802_1"]="The final polluted beast lets out a prolonged scream, leaving the entrance of the Tianli Clan's ancestral mansion in disarray but restoring peace once more.",
  ["1001061802_10"]="Get your people to bring a stretcher and carry you inside. You should avoid moving for three days.",
  ["1001061802_11"]="Who are you exactly...?",
  ["1001061802_12"]="...",
  ["1001061802_13"]="Me? Well, I've been pondering how to introduce myself to the descendants of the Tianli Clan...",
  ["1001061802_14"]="Unfortunately, I haven't found the right words.",
  ["1001061802_15"]="You can think of me as an old friend. A very, very old friend of your clan.",
  ["1001061802_16"]="...Thank you for your help. We Tianli people will surely repay your kindness.",
  ["1001061802_17"]="No need for repayment. However, if you remain here, your safety would be in question.",
  ["1001061802_18"]="You're the patriarch, right? Lead your people out of the city.",
  ["1001061802_19"]="But I can't. We have an ancestral decree...",
  ["1001061802_2"]="...",
  ["1001061802_20"]="We Tianli people must not leave this city unless absolutely necessary.",
  ["1001061802_21"]="...",
  ["1001061802_22"]="Heh, your stubbornness is just like that your ancestor.",
  ["1001061802_23"]="Well, it is absolutely necessary now. Your ancestor wouldn't fault you.",
  ["1001061802_24"]="Listen up, time is running out. The trouble here is far from over.",
  ["1001061802_25"]="Seize this chance and evacuate your people from the mountain. Be quick.",
  ["1001061802_26"]="The stranger's voice is gentle and composed, yet carries undeniable authority.",
  ["1001061802_27"]="Furthermore, his words are undeniably reasonable.",
  ["1001061802_28"]="Will you adhere to tradition when your clan faces an unprecedented crisis? It's unwise to be rigid.",
  ["1001061802_29"]="Li Chi nods almost instinctively in agreement.",
  ["1001061802_3"]="...",
  ["1001061802_30"]="I understand.",
  ["1001061802_31"]="Great. Oh, by the way, your skills are commendable. Your ancestor would be so proud of you.",
  ["1001061802_32"]="An old friend's help can only go so far. Stay safe, Li Chi.",
  ["1001061802_33"]="When Li Chi snaps back to reality, the stranger has long departed.",
  ["1001061802_34"]="How did he know my name...?",
  ["1001061802_35"]="His cerulean eyes strike a strangely familiar chord.",
  ["1001061802_36"]="It feels like unexpectedly reconnecting with a childhood acquaintance after years of separation.",
  ["1001061802_37"]="Li Chi scratches his head in puzzle.",
  ["1001061802_38"]="Have I ever met him before?",
  ["1001061802_39"]="No, wait! Why did he come out from our ancestral mansion?!",
  ["1001061802_4"]="...",
  ["1001061802_5"]="...",
  ["1001061802_6"]="Ahhh, youngsters these days...",
  ["1001061802_7"]="Shouldn't you at least say \"thank you,\" young man?",
  ["1001061802_8"]="Li Chi straightened his back, attempting to mask his discomfort, but the splitting headache made his legs buckle, nearly sending him tumbling to the ground.",
  ["1001061802_9"]="Best you stay put for now.",
  ["1001061901_1"]="Bifang",
  ["1001061901_10"]="Everyone looks up except for Yuanquan, who calmly gazes at me.",
  ["1001061901_11"]="You had a question for me earlier, Head Librarian, before the earthquake interrupted us.",
  ["1001061901_12"]="About the crane on Mount Tianque you were curious about...",
  ["1001061901_13"]="Yes, there is a crane that fits your description perfectly.",
  ["1001061901_14"]="It goes by the name \"Bifang.\"",
  ["1001061901_15"]="Is that the name of that giant bird?",
  ["1001061901_16"]="Who came up with that name?",
  ["1001061901_17"]="Indeed, it's a name steeped in ancient history, though largely forgotten now.",
  ["1001061901_18"]="Azi might have spoken of a crane that landed on Mount Tianque when Ji Xia founded our nation thousands of years ago. That crane was Bifang.",
  ["1001061901_19"]="Historical records show that Ji Xia cherished this crane, allowing it to freely roam the palace grounds. In his leisure moments, he would often visit Tianchi Lake to admire it.",
  ["1001061901_2"]="Yuanquan remains by Tianchi Lake, gazing at the greenish water.",
  ["1001061901_20"]="With time, the crane became synonymous with Ji Xia, reflected in all the bronze crane statues scattered across QingYu City.",
  ["1001061901_21"]="And so, a nursery rhyme emerged, \"The mountain stands tall, the river shines bright. Bifang the bird, brings peace in sight.\"",
  ["1001061901_22"]="Naturally, the \"mountain\" refers to Mount Tianque, and the \"river\" to the Grandeur River. As long as Bifang remains, peace will reign in the land.",
  ["1001061901_23"]="Yet, should the crane vanish, Xia's fortunes would soon decline.",
  ["1001061901_24"]="In the realm of Hanze dwells a bird much like a crane, with one leg, green plumes, and a white beak, known as Bifang... This unique bird seems to have been following you ever since you arrived in the city.",
  ["1001061901_25"]="In the clear sky above, that distinctive chirp echoes once more, now much closer than before.",
  ["1001061901_26"]="All eyes turn upward, catching a glimpse of a vivid green hue.",
  ["1001061901_27"]="What's that sound?",
  ["1001061901_28"]="What's that?",
  ["1001061901_29"]="Yuanquan remains silent, moving slowly to the side, softly chanting something.",
  ["1001061901_3"]="We've retrieved the airdrop supplies, Master Yuanquan.",
  ["1001061901_30"]="Bifang, the legendary bird, returns after years untold. The city stands, timeless and bold, but its people, a different mold!",
  ["1001061901_31"]="Looks like the guardian of this city isn't too keen on letting us seal off the Dragon Pillar.",
  ["1001061901_32"]="The crane's chirps reverberate in the clouds directly above us.",
  ["1001061901_33"]="Its chirps seem to be an invitation.",
  ["1001061901_34"]="Who is it inviting?",
  ["1001061901_35"]="For what purpose?",
  ["1001061901_36"]="Perhaps it's asking someone to join in its dance.",
  ["1001061901_37"]="Bifang's songs and dances were a highlight during the Xia festivals in Ji Xia's time.",
  ["1001061901_38"]="As for whom it's inviting...",
  ["1001061901_39"]="All eyes now focus on me.",
  ["1001061901_4"]="Here's the list, and everything seems fine. The shell is a bit loose but it won't be an issue. The sarcophagus parts for the Dragon Pillar are intact.",
  ["1001061901_40"]="Millennia later, the melodious chirps of Bifang, seen as an auspicious omen, resonate one final time by the shores of Tianchi Lake.",
  ["1001061901_5"]="Delphic Oracle's technology is truly reliable. And it's all thanks to the Head Librarian and Zero...",
  ["1001061901_6"]="The elder looks in my direction.",
  ["1001061901_7"]="Thank you, Head Librarian.",
  ["1001061901_8"]="We'll be sealing off the Beacon soon.",
  ["1001061901_9"]="Suddenly, a chirp echoes from the sky.",
  ["1001061902_1"]="The giant bird lowered its head, and the light in its eyes gradually dimmed.",
  ["1001061902_10"]="Since ancient times, death has been inevitable, and you are no exception.",
  ["1001061902_11"]="He bows, recognizing the demise of yet another legend.",
  ["1001061902_12"]="What it is, exactly...?",
  ["1001061902_13"]="You know its origins.",
  ["1001061902_14"]="The elder stands upright and turns his gaze towards me once more.",
  ["1001061902_15"]="Well, esteemed guests from far-off lands, now that we have a moment to rest, let me share a legend with you.",
  ["1001061902_16"]="A legend about... immortality.",
  ["1001061902_17"]="That was a distant era.",
  ["1001061902_18"]="That was a distant era.&Back then, the mountains and rivers were young, unnamed living beings thrived without language, writing, or established doctrines.&The river flowed ceaselessly, nurturing the first people who prospered and multiplied.",
  ["1001061902_2"]="Like a lamp that has burned for too long, finally consuming the last drop of oil.",
  ["1001061902_3"]="But behind that fading light, there was no fear of the impending death.",
  ["1001061902_4"]="It felt more like a long-held wish was finally fulfilled, with no regrets left.",
  ["1001061902_5"]="Unknowingly, I extended my hand toward it.",
  ["1001061902_6"]="But before I could touch Bi Fang, its body—now stripped of flesh and made of Cerulean Crystals—had already withered in the autumn wind.",
  ["1001061902_7"]="It was like a stone that had weathered for thousands of years or a pine tree long rotten, scattering and drifting away.",
  ["1001061902_8"]="Slowly, Yuanquan walks towards the remnants of the white crane and lets out a sigh.",
  ["1001061902_9"]="One can accompany someone for a thousand miles, but in the end, there is bound to be a parting.",
  ["1001062001_1"]="Reserved",
  ["1001062001_10"]="This is wonderful, isn't it?",
  ["1001062001_11"]="Thus, he continued his carefree odyssey.",
  ["1001062001_12"]="Despite the establishment of Xia, many clans still led primitive lives in distant lands.",
  ["1001062001_13"]="The light of civilization had yet to illuminate those untamed regions.",
  ["1001062001_14"]="\"The inhabitants subsisted on wild fruits, contended with feral beasts for sustenance, and grappled with sickness and wounds.\"",
  ["1001062001_15"]="Wherever he roamed, pleas for assistance echoed from all directions.",
  ["1001062001_16"]="\"Please, save us.\"",
  ["1001062001_17"]="\"Teach us how to satisfy our hunger, fight illness, protect ourselves from the cold and beasts...\"",
  ["1001062001_18"]="\"Guide us on leading a content and peaceful life...\"",
  ["1001062001_19"]="Thus, Ji Xia shared his knowledge with those people far from the civilized world.",
  ["1001062001_2"]="Extended Years",
  ["1001062001_20"]="When they hungered, he instructed them in farming.",
  ["1001062001_21"]="When they shivered, he guided them in weaving.",
  ["1001062001_22"]="When they lacked tools, he taught them pottery-making.",
  ["1001062001_23"]="And when they felt despondent, he played melodies for them.",
  ["1001062001_24"]="He educated them on crop diversity, on utilizing plows and hoes, and on mastering planting and harvesting cycles.",
  ["1001062001_25"]="Throughout his extensive journey, he sampled nearly all wildflowers, herbs, and fruits.",
  ["1001062001_26"]="Some of these unfamiliar plants brought relief and even cured common maladies.",
  ["1001062001_27"]="Yet others triggered headaches, vomiting, and diarrhea.",
  ["1001062001_28"]="Fortunately, his constitution proved far hardier than most, always resilient.",
  ["1001062001_29"]="Thus, he identified those nameless plants and herbs, categorizing them as edible, poisonous, or medicinal.",
  ["1001062001_3"]="Those were the most unrestrained years of his life.",
  ["1001062001_30"]="\"He sowed various grains based on soil conditions, explored myriad herb types, and enlightened his people on agricultural practices and cultivation.\"",
  ["1001062001_31"]="Time flowed swiftly, and a decade slipped away.",
  ["1001062001_32"]="At times, he drifted into a reverie, unsure if time truly raced past or if his days were so unstructured that he lost track of it.",
  ["1001062001_33"]="His departure from QingYu City seemed like just yesterday.",
  ["1001062001_34"]="Life unfolds in seasons. In his perspective, spring represented birth to ten years old, a time of carefree existence; summer encapsulated ten to twenty, a period of growth.",
  ["1001062001_35"]="Twenty to thirty symbolized autumn, characterized by toil and harvest, while thirty to forty ushered in winter, a phase waiting for closure.",
  ["1001062001_36"]="However, the winter meant for him never arrived.",
  ["1001062001_37"]="When he occasionally studied his reflection in water, time's passage seemed to leave no marks on his face.",
  ["1001062001_38"]="His gaze remained keen, his limbs sturdy, his mind sharp.",
  ["1001062001_39"]="His body showed no signs of aging.",
  ["1001062001_4"]="Nature was bountiful, and everything felt uninhibited.",
  ["1001062001_40"]="Why is this happening...?",
  ["1001062001_41"]="No one could provide an answer to his question, only the moon's reflection in the water silently observing him.",
  ["1001062001_42"]="However, a strange sensation gripped his heart. Ji Xia rose, peering towards the direction of QingYu City.",
  ["1001062001_43"]="Uncertainty lingered about the well-being of his old friends.",
  ["1001062001_44"]="\"Maybe I should go back.\"",
  ["1001062001_45"]="As the notion struck, he acted swiftly, reminiscent of his departure from QingYu City.",
  ["1001062001_46"]="Before embarking, he cast one more glance at the flowing river.",
  ["1001062001_47"]="Well, I haven't found its source in the end.",
  ["1001062001_48"]="For him, asserting that his journey was free of regrets would be self-deceptive.",
  ["1001062001_49"]="Yet, the beauty of the landscapes he had witnessed provided ample tales to recount upon his reunion with his friends.",
  ["1001062001_5"]="He chased elk and birds through the woods, journeyed along trails and streams devoid of human touch, satisfied his hunger with fruits, and quenched his thirst with dew, all the while losing himself in the rhythm of nature.",
  ["1001062001_50"]="The journey homeward progressed notably smoother.",
  ["1001062001_51"]="The once fledgling villages he left behind had transformed into bustling settlements within a decade.",
  ["1001062001_52"]="Journeying back, all settlements thrived, a testament to Li Jun's skilled governance during his absence.",
  ["1001062001_53"]="After traversing vast distances, the snow-capped peaks of Mount Tianque gradually emerged on the horizon, indicating QingYu City's proximity.",
  ["1001062001_54"]="Enveloped in a perpetual mist, the city resembled a white shroud from afar.",
  ["1001062001_55"]="However, as the city's features sharpened, he was startled to realize that the prevalent white hue was not mist.",
  ["1001062001_56"]="It was white fabric typically reserved for mourning.",
  ["1001062001_57"]="Whose passing had draped the entire city in mourning attire?",
  ["1001062001_58"]="A foreboding thought flitted through his mind, yet he shunned unveiling the answer, hastening his pace.",
  ["1001062001_59"]="Chaos pervaded his surroundings.",
  ["1001062001_6"]="Time seemed irrelevant in the mountains.",
  ["1001062001_60"]="Turning away from the commoners kneeling in grief, mourning their loved ones, their lamentations unheard, he pressed forward through the crowds towards the royal palace.",
  ["1001062001_61"]="And then...",
  ["1001062001_62"]="From a distance, he spotted several familiar figures standing on the bridge.",
  ["1001062001_63"]="After a decade's absence, his initial reaction, however, wasn't one of joyful reunion but of sheer dread.",
  ["1001062001_64"]="The faces of his familiar ministers and friends all bore an ominous cerulean tint.",
  ["1001062001_65"]="Their features — eyes, ears, nose, hair, skin, hands, and feet — no longer resembled human flesh and bone but appeared more like sculptures.",
  ["1001062001_66"]="They seemed as if crafted from the Tianli Clan's Cerulean Crystals.",
  ["1001062001_67"]="Metallic echoes reverberated from their voices, their words ringing like iron.",
  ["1001062001_68"]="\"Why...? Why is this happening?\"",
  ["1001062001_69"]="The question lingered on the tip of his tongue, ready to break free when a distant sound filled the sky.",
  ["1001062001_7"]="Whenever he paused, the surrounding landscape appeared fresh, as if seen for the first time.",
  ["1001062001_70"]="Bells.",
  ["1001062001_71"]="It was the toll of a bell.",
  ["1001062001_72"]="It dissolved the chaos, bringing this prolonged dream to a definitive conclusion.",
  ["1001062001_73"]="The toll of the bell in this extended dream jolts him awake.",
  ["1001062001_74"]="Getting up from the cold stone, he cradles his head in his hands.",
  ["1001062001_75"]="...That was quite a long dream.",
  ["1001062001_76"]="Life resembles a dream. Yet upon awakening, the gleaming goblet, the radiant moon, the pleasant times — all vanish.",
  ["1001062001_77"]="His gaze wanders.",
  ["1001062001_78"]="Magnificent structures sprawl around him, stretching into the distance.",
  ["1001062001_79"]="Splendid yet lifeless, devoid of human vitality and warmth.",
  ["1001062001_80"]="It exudes a funereal stillness reminiscent of a mausoleum.",
  ["1001062001_81"]="Brushing off the dust from his sleeves, he tightens his grip on the sword.",
  ["1001062001_82"]="The ancient entanglement that has persisted for millennia shall be ended here and now.",
  ["1001062001_88"]="Ji Xia",
  ["1001062001_9"]="Hmm...",
  ["1001070101_1"]="The Opponent",
  ["1001070101_10"]="The study's decor changes with each successor, reflecting their personal tastes. A calligraphy enthusiast might adorn the space with ink and parchment, whereas a tea connoisseur would bring in kettles and cups, and one with a passion for gardening would grace the room with lively blooms and verdant foliage.",
  ["1001070101_100"]="But for us, it's all a matter of luck. Some Yuanquans were lucky enough to meet him twice, maybe even three times. Others lived and died without ever seeing him.",
  ["1001070101_101"]="You've got access to the records now. If you're interested, feel free to study them yourself.",
  ["1001070101_102"]="The former Yuanquan hands him the thick game record. The handwriting for the black pieces changed with each era, but the moves for the white pieces were always recorded in the same handwriting, century after century.",
  ["1001070101_103"]="One last question, Master.",
  ["1001070101_104"]="Go on.",
  ["1001070101_105"]="How strong is he? When you faced him... how confident were you?",
  ["1001070101_106"]="The former Yuanquan suddenly bursts into laughter.",
  ["1001070101_107"]="Let me put it this way: you could spend a lifetime trying to figure out how to place your five stones.",
  ["1001070101_108"]="If you ever get the chance to face him, make sure you play a game worthy of the moment.",
  ["1001070101_109"]="Yuanquan opens his eyes, and the turquoise waters of Tianchi Lake fill his vision.",
  ["1001070101_11"]="Of course, not all Yuanquans cared for such refinements. One in particular, known for his sheer strength and battlefield prowess, turned the study into something more like an armory than a sanctuary of thought. The shelves were filled with nothing but war manuals, placed there mostly to keep the grumbling scholars of the Society off his back.",
  ["1001070101_110"]="He is old now, his once-long hair now gray with age.",
  ["1001070101_111"]="For decades, he has carefully studied the game records, replaying countless matches in his mind.",
  ["1001070101_112"]="He has spent most of his life seated at his side of the board, yet his opponent has never shown up.",
  ["1001070101_113"]="But now, he is certain—the opponent he has never faced, the one who has been going up against generations of Yuanquans for millennia, is finally about to sit across from him.",
  ["1001070101_114"]="Very soon, he will finally get to see who his opponent really is.",
  ["1001070101_115"]="Now, it is time to condense all of his life into these five moves.",
  ["1001070101_116"]="It is my turn to play, Emperor.",
  ["1001070101_118"]="Deep under the lake, the Beacon rests dormant, locked away in the sarcophagus.",
  ["1001070101_119"]="How often...? Good question. To him, though, it probably never feels like much time passes between each visit.",
  ["1001070101_12"]="But no matter how much the room changed with each new generation, one thing always stayed the same.",
  ["1001070101_13"]="The Go board.",
  ["1001070101_14"]="The first time he saw it, he was just a boy. It rested in the corner of the large, encased in a transparent glass cover, with a thick book of game records placed beside it.",
  ["1001070101_15"]="Curious, he flipped through its pages. The exact date of the first game had long faded, but the earliest clear record read...",
  ["1001070101_16"]="A thousand years ago?!",
  ["1001070101_17"]="Driven by curiosity, he began flipping through the pages. However, just as he reached the last one, a hand suddenly pressed down on the book.",
  ["1001070101_18"]="Have you finished cleaning?",
  ["1001070101_19"]="M—Master Yuanquan! I... I'm sorry, I—",
  ["1001070101_2"]="At the peak of Mount Tianque, beside the serene waters of Tianchi Lake.",
  ["1001070101_20"]="I know you meant no harm.",
  ["1001070101_21"]="Finish your task first.",
  ["1001070101_22"]="Yes, Master.",
  ["1001070101_23"]="The study wasn't large, so the cleaning didn't take long. As he worked, Yuanquan remained by the Go board, staring through the glass as if lost in thought.",
  ["1001070101_24"]="Master Yuanquan? ...Master Yuanquan?",
  ["1001070101_25"]="What is it?",
  ["1001070101_26"]="Who's playing against whom here?",
  ["1001070101_27"]="Ha... Ha! That's not something I can tell you just yet, little one.",
  ["1001070101_28"]="Some secrets are meant to stay hidden.",
  ["1001070101_29"]="From that day on, the young man returned to clean the study time and time again. The board, however, remained untouched.",
  ["1001070101_3"]="Bifang has vanished without a trace, like smoke in the wind.",
  ["1001070101_30"]="Time and time again, he would find Yuanquan standing before the board, lost in thought, as if having a silent conversation with an unseen opponent.",
  ["1001070101_31"]="And as time passed, he, too, grew wiser and sharper.",
  ["1001070101_32"]="The responsibility of WeiShi will soon rest upon your shoulders.",
  ["1001070101_33"]="This study, and this board, will be yours as well.",
  ["1001070101_4"]="A tall old man stands, gazing out at the water. The lake still has a faint green tint, but if all goes as planned, the water should clear up in a few days.",
  ["1001070101_5"]="With his eyes closed to contemplate, replaying the events of the past few days, the current happening, and the web of information in his mind, trying to make sense of it all.",
  ["1001070101_6"]="But for some reason, his mind drifts far beyond that, pulled toward a distant time long gone.",
  ["1001070101_7"]="Perhaps, in a way, that's where his journey began. Every step he took since, paved the way for where he stands now, leading him to this moment by the Tianchi Lake.",
  ["1001070101_71"]="He has always loved playing Go ever since he was young.",
  ["1001070101_72"]="Just as everything starts from one, the black and white patterns on the 361 intersections of the board unfold from the very first move.",
  ["1001070101_73"]="Since time began, no games of Go have ever been repeated.",
  ["1001070101_74"]="Within the confines of this finite board, an endless possibility of play unfolds.",
  ["1001070101_75"]="He has a deep love for the game of Go. By settling quietly by the board, calm and still, one challenger after another would take their seat across from him, stones in hand, and make their moves.",
  ["1001070101_76"]="Without the need to look up, by studying the board, he can envision his opponent's face.",
  ["1001070101_77"]="A wise victor knows that true strength lies in avoiding conflict; a master strategist draws power from the freedom of flexible plans. A true warrior stands resilient, untouched by defeat, while the resourceful, even in loss, remains as calm as the quiet dawn.",
  ["1001070101_78"]="On the board, what unfolds is not merely the outcome of the game. In every move, a player's entire life is laid bare.",
  ["1001070101_79"]="You've spent years searching for the truth behind this game, haven't you?",
  ["1001070101_8"]="Back then, he had not yet abandoned his original name, nor was he called \"Yuanquan\" by the members of WeiShi.",
  ["1001070101_80"]="...You knew all along?",
  ["1001070101_81"]="You've always been obsessed with the Go game. How could I not know? Now that the board has been entrusted to you, it is time for you to learn the truth.",
  ["1001070101_82"]="Like you've probably already guessed, one of the players on this board... has always been the Yuanquan of WeiShi.",
  ["1001070101_83"]="I suspected as much... but who exactly is our opponent?",
  ["1001070101_84"]="For the first time, he interrupts his master.",
  ["1001070101_85"]="The Classic of Go teaches: Within each person resides a veiled nature, and it is only when external forces stir them that their true feelings come to light. To understand another's mind, one must observe patiently, letting time unravel all that lies hidden.",
  ["1001070101_86"]="And yet, no matter how much I analyze the moves, I can never quite figure out what my opponent is thinking when they place their pieces.",
  ["1001070101_87"]="The Classic of Go further teaches: Novices cling to the edges, veterans secure the corners, and masters command the center.",
  ["1001070101_88"]="But their style is unpredictable. At times, they expand boldly, setting the stage for a grand encirclement. Other times, they cut off their opponent's paths with fierce precision, fighting for a tactical advantage. And sometimes, they simply defend a small corner, biding time and securing just enough territory to survive.",
  ["1001070101_89"]="Master, no matter how hard I try, I can't grasp the nature of my opponent.",
  ["1001070101_9"]="Hidden deep within the WeiShi compound in CangLin City is a quiet, elegant study, exclusive to those who have borne the title of \"Yuanquan.\"",
  ["1001070101_90"]="Is his opponent calm or impulsive? Honest or cunning? Open-hearted or full of doubt...? No matter how many times he poured over the game record, he couldn't catch even the slightest glimpse of his opponent's true nature.",
  ["1001070101_91"]="Of course you can't. You're still too young. If you were a book, you'd be just a few pages. Your opponent, however, is a tome as vast as history itself.",
  ["1001070101_92"]="Most game records you've seen are usually settled in hours or days. But a lifetime? That's long enough to change a person in ways no one can predict.",
  ["1001070101_93"]="...",
  ["1001070101_94"]="Don't dwell on it. When the time comes, everything will make sense. Just remember, your opponent across that board isn't just any rival—he's a guest of honor.",
  ["1001070101_95"]="You haven't met him yet, but if he comes during your lifetime, you must give everything you've got to defeat him. That's the only way WeiShi will show him the respect he truly deserves.",
  ["1001070101_96"]="I understand, Master.",
  ["1001070101_97"]="One more thing: there's an unspoken rule. You can never place more than five stones during the game.",
  ["1001070101_98"]="That's why this game has lasted for centuries, never really coming to an end. And that's also why our guest keeps returning, anticipating his next visit.",
  ["1001070101_99"]="How often does he come?",
  ["1001070201_1"]="The story, passed down through countless generations, flows like an endless stream.",
  ["1001070201_10"]="A shadow of sorrow flickers deep within Yuanquan's eyes, a grief too heavy for words to describe.",
  ["1001070201_11"]="A voice interrupts our conversation.",
  ["1001070201_12"]="Master Yuanquan, the Dragon Pillar has been completely sealed, and the dam by Tianchi Lake has been repaired.",
  ["1001070201_13"]="Looks like the Cerulean Waters have been fully contained.",
  ["1001070201_14"]="We greatly appreciate your help, Head Librarian. We never would've been able to seal the Pillar so easily without you and Miss Zero.",
  ["1001070201_15"]="The story is not over.",
  ["1001070201_16"]="This is not the end.",
  ["1001070201_17"]="Where is Ji Xia?",
  ["1001070201_18"]="Where is the one who started all of this?",
  ["1001070201_19"]="Whether it is the Ji Xia in Yuanquan's account or the one in the present, neither has reached the end of their story.",
  ["1001070201_20"]="So many questions remain unanswered stuck within my throat, yet I am struggling with where to even begin.",
  ["1001070201_21"]="Head Librarian, there is something I would like you to personally retrieve for us.",
  ["1001070201_22"]="What is it?",
  ["1001070201_24"]="Why me?",
  ["1001070201_27"]="It's something deeply connected to the source of all this—to Ji Xia.",
  ["1001070201_28"]="Because it holds the key to the next chapter of the story you're trying to uncover.",
  ["1001070201_29"]="Find it, and all your doubts will be put to rest.",
  ["1001070201_3"]="At the heart of Tianchi Lake, the greenish hue slowly begins to fade.",
  ["1001070201_30"]="It's the lost Imperial Seal of the First Emperor.",
  ["1001070201_31"]="You could say it's the national treasure of Qian, but like most things from the First Emperor's time, it just vanished into history.",
  ["1001070201_32"]="However, from what we've gathered from WeiShi, I believe it's not lost to the world. It still exists, hidden somewhere in the imperial palace of QingYu City, tucked away in its countless towers and halls.",
  ["1001070201_33"]="Will this help with the problem we're facing right now?",
  ["1001070201_34"]="Why search for a relic?",
  ["1001070201_35"]="Trust me on this. It's the final piece of the puzzle. It's the key to the truth.",
  ["1001070201_36"]="Instead of listening to me ramble on, why not go see for yourself?",
  ["1001070201_37"]="Thank you, Head Librarian. I'll be here, waiting for your good news.",
  ["1001070201_38"]="The Search",
  ["1001070201_4"]="This story, as lengthy as it is, must end here for now.",
  ["1001070201_5"]="Looks like the sealing of the Dragon Pillar is almost done.",
  ["1001070201_6"]="Hold on...",
  ["1001070201_7"]="Wait, you haven't finished the story yet.",
  ["1001070201_8"]="What happened after Ji Xia returned?",
  ["1001070201_9"]="...",
  ["1001070202_1"]="The locking mechanism disengages, and the gate slowly opens.",
  ["1001070202_2"]="\"The tower soars from the earth's deep core, Its peak dances with heavens evermore. To ascend is to transcend mortal lore, Its spiral stairs in void explore. Over the sacred land, its grandeur stands, As if by ethereal, shaping hands. Four corners eclipse the sun's bright bands, Tier upon tier, to heaven's strands.\"",
  ["1001070202_3"]="Let's head inside. I have a feeling we'll find what we're looking for.",
  ["1001070202_4"]="This is a poem from a previous era, commemorating the Kanjiang Pavilion.",
  ["1001070301_80"]="True to Ming's words, the moment I step inside, the weight of history engulfs me.",
  ["1001070301_81"]="Every scroll, every statue in this hall stands as a testament to the great figures who once shaped the fate of Qian.",
  ["1001070301_82"]="Some expanded their borders, some governed with wisdom, some quelled chaos, and others saved the people from disasters.",
  ["1001070301_83"]="In the end, all of this was distilled into a handful of names in the hallowed annals of history, now immortalized as countless faces gazing upon the living world from within the Kanjiang Pavilion.",
  ["1001070301_84"]="The pavilion has multiple floors with a complex layout, and it's not usually open to the public.",
  ["1001070301_85"]="Artifacts related to the First Emperor are stored on the top floor. That's where we're headed.",
  ["1001070301_87"]="Kanjiang Pavilion",
  ["1001070302_1"]="In the center of the hall stands a weathered statue, its face worn almost beyond recognition. Still, the reverence around it makes it clear that this is the First Emperor, Ji Xia.",
  ["1001070302_10"]="While checking out the statues, Azi suddenly spots something.",
  ["1001070302_11"]="Ming, look at this.",
  ["1001070302_12"]="And they all share the same year of death—this year. But why?",
  ["1001070302_13"]="These engravings are new.",
  ["1001070302_14"]="The birth dates are all faded from age, but the death dates...",
  ["1001070302_15"]="These must be their birth and death dates… but something's off.",
  ["1001070302_16"]="She crouches down and runs her fingers over one of the pedestals, brushing away a layer of dust from the engraved date.",
  ["1001070302_17"]="...",
  ["1001070302_18"]="Someone was here before us. They changed the inscriptions and added the death dates.",
  ["1001070302_19"]="As a mark of respect, the statues of the honored figures in Kanjiang Pavilion only have their birth years engraved, symbolizing their lasting legacy and remembrance.",
  ["1001070302_2"]="On both sides stand two statues—one of a warrior, strong and imposing, and the other of a scholar, holding something in his hands.",
  ["1001070302_20"]="Hmm... last time I was here, it wasn't like this.",
  ["1001070302_21"]="Ming crouches down as well, carefully inspecting the inscriptions.",
  ["1001070302_22"]="I crouch down, running my fingers over the engravings.",
  ["1001070302_23"]="They're trying to send a message.",
  ["1001070302_24"]="It's an act of spite.",
  ["1001070302_25"]="You think they left this as a clue for us?",
  ["1001070302_26"]="An act of spite? Interesting. If we look at it from that perspective, the vandal...",
  ["1001070302_27"]="Li Jun and Cang Luo's pedestals haven't been altered.",
  ["1001070302_28"]="So... it's just the statues of the \"officials\" that got altered.",
  ["1001070302_29"]="Most of these figures were Ji Xia's blood relatives—the first royal lineage of Qian.",
  ["1001070302_3"]="What's written on these pedestals?",
  ["1001070302_30"]="Wait, it's not just them. Even Ji Xia's statue now has a death year. And it's... this year?",
  ["1001070302_31"]="Who hates the Ji clan so much that they'd deface these statues like this? It's not like Ji Xia came back to do it himself... right?",
  ["1001070302_32"]="Too many unanswered questions.",
  ["1001070302_33"]="Maybe it is him.",
  ["1001070302_34"]="Hmm... This is puzzling. We should document this and report it to Master Yuanquan. He might have some insights.",
  ["1001070302_35"]="Haha, you're telling me the guy obsessed with immortality, is out here cursing himself to die? Now that would be pretty ironic.",
  ["1001070302_36"]="Right now, finding the seal is our top priority. Everything else can wait.",
  ["1001070302_37"]="Staring at the small pile of dust beneath the statues, I feel a strange sense of unease.",
  ["1001070302_38"]="A chilling sensation seeps through the entire Kanjiang Pavilion.",
  ["1001070302_39"]="Gradually, I begin to realize where this unsettling feeling is coming from.",
  ["1001070302_4"]="Qing never taught me how to read this script.",
  ["1001070302_40"]="With those freshly engraved death dates, this place no longer feels like a hall honoring the statues of great heroes.",
  ["1001070302_41"]="Instead, it feels like a cemetery, where each statue serves as an honorary gravestone for someone whose time of death has already been determined by another.",
  ["1001070302_42"]="Ming's voice snaps me out of my scattered thoughts.",
  ["1001070302_43"]="Looks like there's nothing useful left here.",
  ["1001070302_44"]="Let's head to Wencheng Pavilion.",
  ["1001070302_45"]="Wencheng Pavilion?",
  ["1001070302_46"]="It's another ancient structure from Ji Xia's era, housing a collection of historical records and texts. We might find something useful there.",
  ["1001070302_5"]="It's an ancient form of Qian's writing, so it's normal not to recognize it.",
  ["1001070302_6"]="This one is \"Cang Luo,\" Qian's first scribe. He accompanied the First Emperor for years and laid the foundation for Qian's historical records, which is why some call him the \"Sage of History.\"",
  ["1001070302_7"]="This figure is \"Li Jun,\" believed to be the ancestor of the Tianli clan. He was a close confidant of Ji Xia and even ruled in his stead at one point.",
  ["1001070302_8"]="Is he holding something... Is that a giant seal?",
  ["1001070302_9"]="That's the legendary Imperial Seal Cang Luo carved for Ji Xia himself. The artisans of that era even carved a replica of it into his statue.",
  ["1001070401_1"]="At least, time is on my side...",
  ["1001070401_10"]="But you are eternal. No matter how far this dynasty falls, you'll have to witness every moment of its decline.",
  ["1001070401_11"]="No. Soon, I won't need to worry about worldly affairs anymore.",
  ["1001070401_12"]="Shouldn't I be the one telling you that, Cang Luo?",
  ["1001070401_13"]="Please take good care, Your Majesty.",
  ["1001070401_14"]="Ji Xia accepts the seal. Cang Luo turns to leave but pauses for a brief moment before speaking again.",
  ["1001070401_15"]="Now, it is time to return it to its rightful owner.",
  ["1001070401_16"]="As you instructed, during Regent Li Jun's rule, he penned the edicts while I affixed the seal.",
  ["1001070401_17"]="Cang Luo hands over a jade seal with both hands, turning it so the inscription on its base faced up. Engraved into the stone are the words: \"Justice of the World.\"",
  ["1001070401_18"]="One more thing... before I go, I must return this to you.",
  ["1001070401_19"]="Thank you, Your Majesty.",
  ["1001070401_2"]="He clenches the jade seal tightly.",
  ["1001070401_20"]="You may leave now.",
  ["1001070401_21"]="Very well.",
  ["1001070401_22"]="Ji Xia sighs once more.",
  ["1001070401_23"]="In the land where the Ji lineage began, people still grow old, get sick, and pass away, instead of living forever.",
  ["1001070401_24"]="Though Mount Tianque towers high and the Grandeur River stretches long, I wish to be laid to rest in the land of my birth.",
  ["1001070401_25"]="I've followed you for thousands of miles, seen nearly every corner of the world. And now, I wish to return to my roots.",
  ["1001070401_26"]="Are you planning to retire to your hometown?",
  ["1001070401_27"]="Ji Xia gazes at the streaks of grey in his old friend's temple, at the wrinkles lining his face, and sighs.",
  ["1001070401_28"]="It's been ten years. You haven't changed a bit, but I've gotten all decrepit.",
  ["1001070401_29"]="Seeing you again just proves it—the waters of Tianchi Lake really are the source of immortality.",
  ["1001070401_3"]="Ruling a nation requires patience, careful thought, and well-laid plans before action...",
  ["1001070401_30"]="Yes.",
  ["1001070401_31"]="Farewell?",
  ["1001070401_32"]="Ji Xia arches an eyebrow.",
  ["1001070401_33"]="I've come to bid you farewell.",
  ["1001070401_34"]="Cang Luo lets out a deep sigh of relief.",
  ["1001070401_35"]="It's fine. Like you said, history will judge in time.",
  ["1001070401_36"]="I... can't leave a detailed record of this matter. I hope Your Majesty understands.",
  ["1001070401_37"]="That's enough. No need to say more.",
  ["1001070401_38"]="Cang Luo hesitates, his expression clouded with unease.",
  ["1001070401_39"]="Li Jun tried to stop it, but you know him well: He was a blade, not a needle. Ruling a nation requires patience, careful thought, and well-laid plans before action... His nature made him an easy target for the royal family. After all, they never truly accepted him as regent, not when he wasn't of royal blood.",
  ["1001070401_4"]="As Cang Luo's footsteps fade down the stairs, Ji Xia turns and looks out over QingYu City.",
  ["1001070401_40"]="...",
  ["1001070401_41"]="And so, the divide was born. Immortals above, mortals below. From that moment on, the royal family no longer saw the people as kin, or even subjects. They saw them as tools to be exploited and discarded…",
  ["1001070401_42"]="The waters of Tianchi Lake granted them immortality, and the entire royal family consumed it. Then, they completely sealed off the bridge you built by the lake, turning it into a dam, cutting off the water from flowing to the lands below.",
  ["1001070401_43"]="The sick within the royal family drank from it, and their conditions ceased to worsen. Some, who were on the brink of death, even rose from their beds, walking and working...",
  ["1001070401_44"]="After you left, the waters of Tianchi Lake turned green on several occasions...",
  ["1001070401_45"]="How did things come to this?",
  ["1001070401_46"]="Cang Luo...",
  ["1001070401_47"]="And your immortal kin.",
  ["1001070401_48"]="The sun... They mean me, don't they?",
  ["1001070401_49"]="...",
  ["1001070401_5"]="I see... Well, then I'll be on my way.",
  ["1001070401_50"]="It means, when will this cursed sun finally die? We'd gladly perish along with you!",
  ["1001070401_51"]="It's a song that has recently found its way into the mouths of the common folk—those who were never granted immortality.",
  ["1001070401_52"]="What did you say?",
  ["1001070401_53"]="\"When will this cursed sun burn out and die, so I may join its end and cease to cry?\"",
  ["1001070401_54"]="Yet below, the workers toiling on the construction sites are dressed in rags, their faces gaunt from hunger. The once-fertile lands at the mountain's base lie deserted. Taskmasters and officials crack their whips, barking orders as laborers haul bricks, timber, and stone.",
  ["1001070401_55"]="From the top of Kanjiang Pavilion, Ji Xia overlooks all of QingYu City. The city bustles with construction, and the imperial palace looms tall and majestic, its grandeur both imposing and solemn.",
  ["1001070401_56"]="But this... is not the future I once envisioned.",
  ["1001070401_57"]="Li Jun ruled as regent for a decade, and you stood by my side from the moment we began our campaign. They could never erase your legacies even if they wanted to.",
  ["1001070401_58"]="Only Li Jun and I are exceptions.",
  ["1001070401_59"]="Only those with unmatched strategy, political acumen, boundless knowledge, or exemplary virtue were chosen... And, of course, above all, those who possessed immortality.",
  ["1001070401_6"]="Another scribe will take your place. You don't need to worry about the affairs of the court.",
  ["1001070401_60"]="When the royal family gathered to build the Kanjiang Pavilion, they set criteria to decide who would be honored here.",
  ["1001070401_61"]="That's how they described themselves, right?",
  ["1001070401_62"]="\"Masterminds of strategy, architects of empire, scholars of unparalleled wisdom, paragons of virtue...\"",
  ["1001070401_63"]="Cang Luo gives a slight bow, choosing not to push the issue. Ji Xia also lets it go, shifting his focus to the other statues.",
  ["1001070401_64"]="Heh. So, you trust history's judgment over your Emperor's?",
  ["1001070401_65"]="History will judge in time. It's not my place to say.",
  ["1001070401_66"]="Do you think I should be held accountable?",
  ["1001070401_67"]="What do you think, Cang Luo?",
  ["1001070401_68"]="...",
  ["1001070401_69"]="They've been cursing you nonstop. They call you a treacherous mongrel, the greatest hypocrite under heaven. They say you killed Li Jun, yet you pretend to be honoring his memory.",
  ["1001070401_7"]="Cang Luo pauses as if waiting for Ji Xia to say something, but Ji Xia's expression does not change.",
  ["1001070401_70"]="Go ahead and speak.",
  ["1001070401_71"]="...",
  ["1001070401_72"]="Cang Luo, what does the Tianli clan say about moving Li Jun's statue into Kanjiang Pavilion?",
  ["1001070401_73"]="Ji Xia turns his gaze to another statue. Its brow is furrowed, eyes burning with fury, one hand gripping the hilt of a sword, poised as if ready to charge into battle at any moment.",
  ["1001070401_74"]="Not really, Your Majesty.",
  ["1001070401_75"]="My face really isn't suited to being carved in stone.",
  ["1001070401_76"]="No matter how many times he looks at it, seeing his own statue always feels a little off.",
  ["1001070401_77"]="...",
  ["1001070401_78"]="Having returned from his travels, the wandering Emperor Ji Xia stands next to the Grand Scribe, Cang Luo.",
  ["1001070401_79"]="Thousands of years ago, at the top of Kanjiang Pavilion.",
  ["1001070401_8"]="The history of this dynasty has come to an end. It's no longer worth recording.",
  ["1001070401_80"]="Farewell",
  ["1001070401_9"]="That's the main reason I'm leaving.",
  ["1001070601_1"]="Find me a place untouched by the mortal world. A land where no commoner will ever set foot. A sanctuary where we can live in perfect peace and solitude, for all eternity.",
  ["1001070601_10"]="The Prime Minister's words are met with enthusiastic applause. Ministers and noblemen chuckle in agreement, their laughter echoing through the hall.",
  ["1001070601_11"]="Once the imperial palace is complete, the summit of Mount Tianque will become a true paradise. No mortal will ever set foot within its walls again. We immortals, untouched by time and armed with weapons crafted from Cerulean Crystals, will forever hold dominion over the common people.",
  ["1001070601_12"]="After all, the weak have no place in this world. If they collapse from exhaustion, it only proves they were never meant to stand. If they die by execution, it is the price of their own incompetence. And if too many fall and slow our progress, we will simply conscript more able-bodied laborers to take their place.",
  ["1001070601_13"]="Ji Xia takes a deep breath, his gaze drifting up to the towering walls outside the palace. Every brick is etched with the names of the laborers who have built it, the markings pressed so tightly together that the letters blur, merging into an endless swarm, like ants weaving their way across the face of a rock.",
  ["1001070601_14"]="Ji Hong lets out a wry chuckle as if recalling something amusing. The sound rattles Ji Xia so much that he almost loses control for a moment.",
  ["1001070601_15"]="The bricks on these walls are proof of that. Each name carved here belongs to a commoner. As for those who dared to stand in the way of our grand ambitions, we simply erased them. Just as we always have, and always will.",
  ["1001070601_16"]="Your Majesty, why concern yourself with such trivialities? The commoners are like wild grass. Cut them down, and new ones grow. There will always be more.",
  ["1001070601_17"]="But how are they supposed to survive the winter? How do you expect them to farm next spring? If they starve to death, what then?",
  ["1001070601_18"]="Your Majesty need not worry. I've assigned my best soldiers to make sure everyone complies. No one will dare to defy us. Those who do, regardless of age or health, will face execution to serve as a warning, and the able-bodied will be sent to labor camps to fill the gaps left behind.",
  ["1001070601_19"]="That's certainly \"efficient.\" But I fear the commoners won't be too happy about that, will they?",
  ["1001070601_2"]="You claim this place is a land of immortals, yet it still clings to the edge of the mortal realm. How can something like that be called paradise?",
  ["1001070601_20"]="For those who can't pay their full tax in silver, we'll take their jewelry. If that still doesn't meet the quota, we'll seize their farming tools. If that isn't enough either, we'll take their cooking pots, utensils, livestock, and whatever else they have left in their homes.",
  ["1001070601_21"]="To cover the costs, I've already ordered taxes to be raised for the next five years. If the autumn harvest doesn't meet the target, we'll take their winter stores. If that's still not enough, we'll take the seeds set aside for spring planting. And if the seeds aren't enough either, we'll send the common folk into the mountains to gather wild fruits and vegetables.",
  ["1001070601_22"]="The silver and grain spent on these walls exceed the entire empire's annual revenue many times over.",
  ["1001070601_23"]="As if seeking validation, the Prime Minister beside him starts boasting about the scale and complexity of the project.",
  ["1001070601_24"]="Your Majesty, these walls are ten meters high and six meters thick, and stretch over twenty kilometers around. They are impenetrable, and the land surrounding them is treacherous. With these walls, our clansmen will be safe and secure, standing strong for generations to come!",
  ["1001070601_25"]="The noble families and high officials are already gathered by the city walls, waiting for Your Majesty's arrival.",
  ["1001070601_26"]="The Grand General drafted tens of thousands of laborers, the Minister of Works oversaw construction day and night, and I personally ensured the flow of silver and grain. That is how we finished ahead of schedule.",
  ["1001070601_27"]="A palace fit for our royal family deserves nothing but our utmost dedication and best efforts!",
  ["1001070601_28"]="The Prime Minister's face lights up at the praise.",
  ["1001070601_29"]="You've been efficient. Weren't we expecting the construction to take another two years?",
  ["1001070601_3"]="What do you mean, Your Majesty?",
  ["1001070601_30"]="The guards and carriages are ready, just outside the hall.",
  ["1001070601_31"]="Your Majesty, I've come to report that the outer walls of the imperial palace are now complete. Please, come and see for yourself.",
  ["1001070601_32"]="Your Majesty.",
  ["1001070601_33"]="Show him in.",
  ["1001070601_34"]="...",
  ["1001070601_35"]="The Prime Minister requests an audience.",
  ["1001070601_36"]="Your Majesty.",
  ["1001070601_37"]="Meanwhile, below, the cries of the starving and freezing commoners are nothing more than a distant murmur, too faint and insignificant to ever breach the high walls of the palace.",
  ["1001070601_38"]="Grand palaces soar into the sky, pavilions seem to drift among the clouds, and extravagant feasts stretch from day to night in endless celebration. Those who have attained immortality live in comfort, free from worldly worries.",
  ["1001070601_39"]="The imperial palace atop Mount Tianque grow more magnificent with each passing year, as construction and renovations continue without end.",
  ["1001070601_4"]="At the sound of those words, the Prime Minister and the nobles gathered around him go pale.",
  ["1001070601_40"]="After Grand Scribe Cang Luo left, the years pass and the seasons change.",
  ["1001070601_41"]="Thousands of years ago, in QingYu City.",
  ["1001070601_42"]="Grand General Ji Hong follows closely behind the Prime Minister. As soon as Ji Xia sees him, his hand, hidden beneath his sleeve, curls into a tight fist around the armrest.",
  ["1001070601_43"]="Within the Walls",
  ["1001070601_5"]="Yeah... your grand project, your paradise... Is this really the best you can come up with? How utterly disappointing.",
  ["1001070601_6"]="Ji Xia does not answer right away. He remains quiet for a moment before he finally speaks.",
  ["1001070601_7"]="Your Majesty... is something wrong?",
  ["1001070601_8"]="Noticing his expression, the laughter slowly fades.",
  ["1001070601_9"]="But Ji Xia's face remains devoid of even the slightest hint of a smile.",
  ["1001070702_10"]="Oh, and then there's this bronze plate. According to the inscription, it was supposed to be a gift for a vassal in the south. But the Tianli clan messed up and had it sent to a vassal in the north instead.",
  ["1001070702_11"]="To make it worse, that northern vassal was in the middle of hosting his son's wedding. And according to their customs, large bronze plates like this were used to offer sacrifices to the dead.",
  ["1001070702_14"]="Long story short, maybe Li Jun was quite adept at ruling the Tianli clan, but when it came to governing the new world unified by Ji Xia? He was totally out of his depth.",
  ["1001070702_15"]="...",
  ["1001070702_16"]="What happened after that?",
  ["1001070702_17"]="Actually, the ritual vessels we passed by earlier might not have all been crafted in the same era. Depending on the era and the ruler, the inscriptions might reveal different takes on the same event.",
  ["1001070702_18"]="But despite the differences in the accounts, the story remains essentially the same: Once Li Jun seized absolute power, criticism of his rule grew louder, and eventually, he was overthrown by the court officials and the royal family. When Ji Xia, who had been wandering for years, finally returned, he was forced to clean up the mess Li Jun had left behind.",
  ["1001070702_19"]="By then, Li Jun had stirred up so much public resentment that if Ji Xia hadn't stepped in just in time to restore order, the empire might have fallen apart. According to the records, as soon as he returned, he wasted no time purging the Tianli clan from the court, and the people cheered when it happened.",
  ["1001070702_2"]="We've been banging on so many instruments since. My arms are killing me. Hey, Professor Ming, what are you staring at?",
  ["1001070702_21"]="One account says that after being ousted, Li Jun refused to accept his fate. He tried to take up arms against Ji Xia, but Ji Hong, Ji Xia's general at the time, struck him down.",
  ["1001070702_22"]="And what happened to Li Jun?",
  ["1001070702_23"]="...",
  ["1001070702_24"]="...",
  ["1001070702_25"]="Oh, and by the way, most of these chime bells were made after Ji Xia returned. Their inscriptions all revolve around one theme: the Eternal Palace.",
  ["1001070702_26"]="The name says it all. It was meant to be a sacred place where Ji Xia and his clansmen could live in peace and prosperity forever.",
  ["1001070702_27"]="Historians have always been captivated by it. According to the scattered records left behind, the palace is said to be a place of unparalleled grandeur, overflowing with treasures.",
  ["1001070702_28"]="Ancient legends paint a vivid picture of it. They say the palace has rivers made of liquid mercury, a starry sky paved with luminous pearls, and eternal lanterns burning with oil extracted from mermaids.",
  ["1001070702_29"]="There's always been speculation that the Eternal Palace is just a \"deferential euphemism\" for the imperial tomb where Ji Xia lies in eternal rest.",
  ["1001070702_3"]="While you were all making a racket, I went ahead and scanned through some inscriptions on these ritual artifacts.",
  ["1001070702_30"]="Of course, we now know that Ji Xia is still alive. But what's strange is that despite all these detailed descriptions passed down through the ages, there's no trace of the palace anywhere in or around QingYu City.",
  ["1001070702_31"]="The Eternal Palace?",
  ["1001070702_32"]="A hidden treasure! Now this is way more interesting than a history lesson! Has anyone ever found it?",
  ["1001070702_33"]="Xin suddenly perks up.",
  ["1001070702_34"]="Why does it always circle back to them?",
  ["1001070702_35"]="Oh, once their restaurant opens, I'm definitely going to swing by and see if I can dig up some info on this!",
  ["1001070702_37"]="Nope. People have searched for generations, but no one's ever uncovered anything.",
  ["1001070702_38"]="Well... except for one possible lead—the Tianli clan.",
  ["1001070702_39"]="Because, according to legend, the Tianli clan, known for their masterful craftsmanship, were the ones who constructed the Eternal Palace.",
  ["1001070702_4"]="If these inscriptions are true, then the Lord of Weaponry's reign was unimpressive. No, scratch that—it was downright atrocious.",
  ["1001070702_40"]="Because of the political corruption during the \"Tianli Regency\" period, the entire clan was branded as sinners and forced to build the Palace as a form of penance for their crimes.",
  ["1001070702_41"]="That was thousands of years ago. Now, they're just regular people, living their lives like anyone else. Just like how we can't separate fact from fiction in Ji Xia's story, they probably have no clue what their ancestor did all those years ago either.",
  ["1001070702_43"]="Miss Ming.",
  ["1001070702_44"]="Huh?",
  ["1001070702_45"]="That's a pretty broad question, Miss Zero.",
  ["1001070702_46"]="History is the sum of all human experiences, and it can be just as complicated as the nature of humans.",
  ["1001070702_47"]="Every artifact around us and every inscription etched into them hold someone's version of the \"truth.\" However, if we shift the perspective or the storyteller, those very records could quickly turn into nothing but a tangled web of lies.",
  ["1001070702_48"]="That's what makes history so profound and fascinating... QingYu City is definitely hiding secrets we can't even begin to imagine.",
  ["1001070702_49"]="Are these records really true?",
  ["1001070702_5"]="One inscription says that Li Jun mistakenly levied double the usual grain tax on the tribe that made this particular bronze vessel. When their leader protested, Li Jun admitted he had miscalculated but didn't seem to care. Instead of returning the excess, he just promised to waive next year's taxes.",
  ["1001070702_50"]="...",
  ["1001070702_51"]="The northern vassal was furious. He smashed the plate to pieces and had his envoy haul the fragments all the way back to QingYu City. Li Jun didn't get angry about it. He just patched the plate back together and sent it off to the southern vassal like nothing had happened.",
  ["1001070702_52"]="By the time the plate showed up, the southern vassal was holding a lavish banquet for his people. And right in front of all his guests, the gift from QingYu City turned out to be a shattered plate—an outright slap in the face. He took it as a direct insult, so he had the whole ordeal etched into the plate as a permanent reminder for future generations to never forget the shame.",
  ["1001070702_6"]="So... he took double this year and then just decided not to tax them next year? What if his subjects starve because of that?",
  ["1001070702_8"]="The inscription doesn't say.",
  ["1001070702_9"]="...",
  ["1001070801_25"]="Besides, only two groups know the secret to immortality: the royal family and the Tianli clan... After all, that traitor, Li Jun, who once stood by your side at Tianchi Lake, was their leader.",
  ["1001070801_26"]="One more thing. Issue a decree: No one outside of the Tianli clan or the royal family is allowed to set foot on this land. Anyone else who dares trespass will be executed on sight.",
  ["1001070801_27"]="Send word. Gather the laborers right away... No, gather the people of the Tianli clan.",
  ["1001070801_28"]="As you wish, Your Majesty.",
  ["1001070801_31"]="This land shall be the realm of immortality. Here, we will build the Eternal Palace.",
  ["1001070801_32"]="...Perfect. This is exactly what I desired.",
  ["1001070801_34"]="Oh? Then let's have a look.",
  ["1001070801_35"]="Please, come and see if it meets your expectations.",
  ["1001070801_36"]="Your Majesty, as you commanded, we've found a secluded place, untouched by the disturbances of the mortal world. At long last, we have what we were looking for.",
  ["1001070801_37"]="Thousands of years ago, inside QingYu City.",
  ["1001070801_38"]="Hmm? Why take such measures, Prime Minister?",
  ["1001070801_39"]="The Realm of the Immortals is a sacred sanctuary, meant only for us. We cannot allow mortal hands to defile it, which is why I forbid ordinary laborers from entering. The Tianli clan may be guilty, but their craftsmanship is unmatched. They are the perfect hands to build a palace worthy of immortals.",
  ["1001070801_40"]="My plan is simple. Once the Realm of the Immortals is complete, the entire Tianli clan will be wiped out. That way, the secret of immortality will belong to us alone, forever.",
  ["1001070801_41"]="Ji Xian speaks with confidence, clearly anticipating approval, oblivious to the flicker of rage in Ji Xia's eyes.",
  ["1001070801_42"]="...",
  ["1001070801_43"]="You...",
  ["1001070801_44"]="Well, you've thought this through more than I have.",
  ["1001070801_45"]="I am honored, Your Majesty.",
  ["1001070801_46"]="I'll make sure those Tianli dogs work twice as hard. Our eternal sanctuary will be up in no time!",
  ["1001070801_47"]="Some time later, in the emperor's private chambers.",
  ["1001070801_48"]="Prime Minister, His Majesty is resting. If you have something urgent, please—",
  ["1001070801_49"]="Move! You're just a mere guard—who do you think you are, blocking my way?",
  ["1001070801_50"]="Or I'll have you join those common wretches in hard labor.",
  ["1001070801_51"]="I... I wouldn't dare! Please, go right ahead, sir!",
  ["1001070801_52"]="Ji Xian scurries into the emperor's chambers. Just as he does, Ji Xia lazily opens his eyes from the imperial couch where he has been resting.",
  ["1001070801_53"]="Quite the commotion... What's going on?",
  ["1001070801_54"]="M—My deepest apologies, Your Majesty. I lost my composure.",
  ["1001070801_55"]="It's just that things took an unexpected turn...",
  ["1001070801_56"]="There's been an incident in the Realm of the Immortals—",
  ["1001070801_57"]="Oh? A problem even you can't handle?",
  ["1001070801_58"]="Ji Xia's words carry a hint of sarcasm, but Ji Xian takes it as a sign of trust. His tone immediately grows confident.",
  ["1001070801_59"]="If Your Majesty wishes, I can take care of it right away, but... this situation is quite unusual. Those Tianli sinners have actually... unearthed the Dragon Vein!",
  ["1001070801_60"]="This is no trivial matter. I didn't dare make a decision on my own without your decree.",
  ["1001070801_61"]="The Dragon Vein...?",
  ["1001070801_62"]="At first, I couldn't believe it either, but after seeing it with my own eyes, there's no doubt about it. It's unmistakable.",
  ["1001070801_63"]="I thought the Dragon Vein was just a myth, but now... Your Majesty, you have to see it for yourself.",
  ["1001070801_64"]="Deep within Mount Tianque, at the site the royal family chose for the Realm of the Immortals.",
  ["1001070801_65"]="...",
  ["1001070801_66"]="...",
  ["1001070801_67"]="What lies before them defies all logic. Every royal official and Tianli craftsman present is struck silent, afraid to even breathe too loudly for fear of disturbing the Dragon Vein.",
  ["1001070801_68"]="Your Majesty... should we... relocate the construction site?",
  ["1001070801_69"]="Ji Xia suddenly claps his hands and bursts into laughter.",
  ["1001070801_70"]="Absolutely not.",
  ["1001070801_71"]="This is an auspicious sign, a divine gift from the heavens.",
  ["1001070801_72"]="Why should we go elsewhere? Issue a decree to continue the construction right here. Not a single inch should be moved!",
  ["1001070801_73"]="The Eternal Palace",
  ["1001070901_111"]="Head Librarian, this is <color=#FEC66B>Wencheng Pavilion</color>.",
  ["1001070901_112"]="Calling this magnificent structure a mere \"pavilion\" almost seems like an insult.",
  ["1001070901_113"]="The moment I step through the door, I feel as if I have caught a glimpse of the Library of Babel.",
  ["1001070901_114"]="Rows upon rows of towering bookshelves stretch endlessly in both directions, packed with countless scrolls and books—so numerous that it feels as if one could drown in them. Standing there feels like being a single, insignificant word in a massive dictionary, surrounded by an infinite sea of recorded wisdom and memory.",
  ["1001070901_115"]="The vastness, depth, and weight of Qian's history are all on full display here.",
  ["1001070901_116"]="Whoa...",
  ["1001070901_117"]="I've heard about this place before, but seeing it in person... it's on a whole other level.",
  ["1001070901_118"]="Alright, if we're looking for records on Ji Xia, this is the most complete archive there is. If it's not here, it probably doesn't exist anywhere.",
  ["1001070901_119"]="And this is just what's left after centuries of war, pillaging, and fires.",
  ["1001070901_120"]="If every record had made it through, Wencheng Pavilion would be way bigger than it is now.",
  ["1001070901_121"]="Quit whining and put those overactive muscles of yours to good use.",
  ["1001070901_122"]="You? You're doing all the heavy lifting. Here, take these. And these. Oh, and these... and these—",
  ["1001070901_123"]="We can skip over the records of Ji Xia's early years and focus on what happened before and after his return.",
  ["1001070901_124"]="But... this is way too much!",
  ["1001070901_125"]="What about me? What am I supposed to do?",
  ["1001070901_126"]="Whoa! Whoa! Slow down! I'm gonna lose my balance!",
  ["1001070901_127"]="As we move through the long corridors, I feel like ants crawling across bamboo scrolls filled with history.",
  ["1001070901_128"]="The ancient texts of Qian are infamous for being obscure and cryptic, but Zero doesn't seem to be bothered at all.",
  ["1001070901_129"]="She skims through the archives at an unbelievable speed, flipping through some books in mere seconds. Some she returns after a quick glance at the table of contents, while others she flips through a little more carefully. But even then, she never spends more than three minutes on a single book.",
  ["1001070901_130"]="Every now and then, she hands me a book or a bamboo scroll, and I just take them and hold them close to my chest, waiting quietly while she keeps moving down the shelves.",
  ["1001070901_131"]="Before I know it, the pile in my arms is nearly as high as my head.",
  ["1001070901_132"]="Done already?",
  ["1001070901_133"]="You read crazy fast.",
  ["1001070901_134"]="I just realized I've read some of these before, back in the Library. Just never connected the dots until now.",
  ["1001070901_135"]="I'm piecing it all together in my head... Reading something is one thing, but actually understanding it is another.",
  ["1001070901_136"]="She takes a portion of the books from my hands.",
  ["1001070901_137"]="I think I've read enough.",
  ["1001070901_138"]="After what feels like forever, we finally reaches the end of the endless rows of bookshelves.",
  ["1001070901_139"]="In front of us is an open space, and in the dim light, a massive black pillar rises high into the rafters of Wencheng Pavilion.",
  ["1001070901_141"]="Oh, looks like we've reached the center of Wencheng Pavilion.",
  ["1001070901_142"]="Let's take a break and go over what we found. I came across some records about the Eternal Palace earlier.",
  ["1001070901_143"]="No.",
  ["1001070901_144"]="In a single night, the empire was left without a ruler. Chaos followed. Wars broke out, and vassals turned on each other.",
  ["1001070901_145"]="After the Eternal Palace was built, Ji Xia and the entire royal family vanished without a trace.",
  ["1001070901_146"]="To be honest, most of the records are vague, fragmented, or missing key details, but there's one thing they all agree on.",
  ["1001070901_147"]="Many historians think so, but no one has solid proof.",
  ["1001070901_149"]="Oh? What do they say? Does it mention any treasure? Anything about luminous pearls? Or mermaid lanterns—",
  ["1001070901_150"]="Ugh, boring...",
  ["1001070901_152"]="So you're saying the fall of Xia is all connected to the Eternal Palace?",
  ["1001070901_153"]="Some believe it was lost in the Grandeur River during the chaos, but despite countless attempts by later rulers to dredge it up, nothing was ever found.",
  ["1001070901_154"]="But just like Ji Xia, the seal vanished into thin air.",
  ["1001070901_155"]="I came across a few mentions of it. After the fall of the Xia dynasty, every dynasty that came after tried to find the seal Cang Luo had carved, since it was considered a priceless national treasure.",
  ["1001070901_157"]="The inscription on the seal reads: \"Heart of the World.\"",
  ["1001070901_158"]="\"Establish the nation at the heart of the world and place the palace at the center of the nation. Only through perfect balance can moral order be achieved; only through benevolence comes sanctity.\"",
  ["1001070901_160"]="Huh? What does that even mean?",
  ["1001070901_161"]="Miss Zero, what are you even talking about?",
  ["1001070901_163"]="Hmm... I was expecting something more along the lines of, \"By the Mandate of Heaven, May the Emperor's Reign Be Long and Prosperous\" or something like that.",
  ["1001070901_164"]="Xin scratches her head.",
  ["1001070901_165"]="It's from a book called \"The Seal Chronicles.\" I remember reading it once at the Library of Babel.",
  ["1001070901_166"]="Oh, I've heard of that. It's a book about all the different designs and uses of imperial seals throughout history.",
  ["1001070901_167"]="But I never would've guessed the Library of Babel would have records dating all the way back to Ji Xia's time... That's pretty mind-blowing.",
  ["1001070901_168"]="So it makes sense that the emperor's seal would be inscribed with the \"Heart of the World\".",
  ["1001070901_169"]="Based on what Miss Zero just said, back in Ji Xia's time, people thought QingYu City was the center of the world, so they made it the capital. Right in the middle of the capital was Tianchi Lake, and that's where they built the imperial palace. Naturally, whoever ruled from the \"Heart of the World\" was seen as the most sacred emperor under heaven.",
  ["1001070901_170"]="Hey, hey, you guys have been talking about this forever, but I'm the one lugging around this giant pile of books!",
  ["1001070901_171"]="I can't hold on much longer... I need to rest a bit!",
  ["1001070901_172"]="With a heavy thud, Xin drops the stack of books on the floor and plops down.",
  ["1001070901_173"]="As if reacting to the noise, the nearby sensor lights flicker on, illuminating the massive black pillar standing at the center of the grand archive.",
  ["1001070901_174"]="Hmm? Why does that thing... look kinda familiar?",
  ["1001070901_175"]="Wait, isn't this the \"sarcophagus\" Master Yuanquan told us to find?",
  ["1001070901_176"]="Just like Xin says, the huge pillar is made of stone. Its shape and size look weirdly familiar.",
  ["1001070901_178"]="The sarcophagus from Delphi Academy was recently built, but this one looks ancient.",
  ["1001070901_179"]="The pillar is riddled with deep erosion marks and delicate cracks, as if it has been submerged in water for centuries.",
  ["1001070901_180"]="Xin steps up and knocks on the pillar. A clear, ringing sound echoes back.",
  ["1001070901_181"]="It's empty inside.",
  ["1001070901_182"]="Professor Ming, any idea what this thing is?",
  ["1001070901_184"]="Hmm... According to records, this was one of the very first foundation pillars laid when Wencheng Pavilion was originally built. The pavilion has endured several devastating fires throughout history, being burned down and rebuilt at least two or three times. However, since the pillar is made of stone, it has survived every fire and has always served as the starting point for reconstruction.",
  ["1001070901_185"]="Quite the opposite. I don't think this pillar was originally meant to be part of any building's foundation... But if that's the case, then what was it made for?",
  ["1001070901_186"]="Oh... so it's really that old. But why is it hollow? Don't tell me ancient builders were cutting corners too.",
  ["1001070901_187"]="Ming furrows her brows slightly.",
  ["1001070901_188"]="Ignoring Ming's remarks, Xin strolls around the pillar before suddenly halting, a look of astonishment on her face.",
  ["1001070901_189"]="Ming, look! There are some inscriptions on it!",
  ["1001070901_190"]="Huh? Lemme see.",
  ["1001070901_191"]="Azi walks over, and as soon as she lays eyes on the inscription, a look of disbelief crosses her face as well.",
  ["1001070901_192"]="This... could this really be something created by WeiShi? All the way back then...?",
  ["1001070901_193"]="Ming keeps staring at the pillar, lost in thought, oblivious to the shock on Xin and Azi's faces.",
  ["1001070901_195"]="Oh? You found writing on your side too? There's some over here as well.",
  ["1001070901_197"]="\"By the Emperor's decree, death is eternally banished.\"",
  ["1001070901_198"]="Zero murmurs the words engraved on the side of the pillar facing Ming.",
  ["1001070901_199"]="Driven by curiosity, I follow Azi to the other side of the pillar.",
  ["1001070901_200"]="Under the warm light, the contours of the pillar still appear sharp and defined. Despite the ravages of time, the deep carvings on its surface remain clear. The hands of its creator have left an indelible mark, untouched by the passing years.",
  ["1001070901_201"]="The ancient characters etched into the pillar are unmistakable, even to Xin. She has memorized these symbols since the moment she joined WeiShi.",
  ["1001070901_202"]="These are the founding tenets of the Society.",
  ["1001070901_203"]="—Attend to the living before obsessing over the divine.",
  ["1001070901_204"]="Huh... sounds interesting, but how's that gonna help us? Didn't Master Yuanquan tell us to find an imperial seal? Any luck with that?",
  ["1001070901_205"]="Wencheng Pavilion",
  ["1001071001_1"]="Do your job well. Don't let him down.",
  ["1001071001_10"]="For now, all you need to know is that I have my own agenda.",
  ["1001071001_100"]="What are you waiting for? You dare make the Emperor wait?",
  ["1001071001_101"]="It is unnaturally stiff, almost like a mask, as if the muscles and skin have hardened into place. His pupils bulges, and both the whites of his eyes and his irises have taken on a sickly cerulean tint.",
  ["1001071001_102"]="The voice of the imperial guard sounds odd, like iron shavings scraping together. As the setting sun bathes the scene, the scribe finally gets a clear look at the guard's face.",
  ["1001071001_103"]="Go in.",
  ["1001071001_104"]="As they reach Tianchi Lake, the view stretches out before them, and the Guard stops at the entrance to the bedchamber.",
  ["1001071001_105"]="The imperial guard moves at a slow, deliberate pace, each step echoing with a heavy clang as metal grind against metal. From behind, the scribe catches sight of the guard's hands gripping the spear, his skin carrying a greenish tint, faintly shimmering with a metallic sheen.",
  ["1001071001_106"]="The grand palace towers soar like rolling waves, rising toward the peak of Mount Tianque and encircling the tranquil waters of Tianchi Lake at its heart.",
  ["1001071001_107"]="The newly appointed scribe follows the Imperial Guard down the long, heavily guarded corridors of the palace, making their way toward the Emperor's bedchamber by Tianchi Lake.",
  ["1001071001_108"]="\"QingYu City stretches in layered grace. Gates unlock in turn, crowning the mountain's face.\"",
  ["1001071001_109"]="The Grand Scribe",
  ["1001071001_11"]="And definitely not to the rest of the royal family. I'd rather not have to go through the trouble of finding a new Grand Scribe right after appointing you.",
  ["1001071001_12"]="From now on, do not bring this matter up again.",
  ["1001071001_13"]="What... do you mean?",
  ["1001071001_14"]="The scribe looks puzzled.",
  ["1001071001_15"]="Do you really believe that just because the emperor never leaves the palace, he's unaware of the world outside?",
  ["1001071001_16"]="Even now, I'm still studying those changes and trying to understand them.",
  ["1001071001_17"]="I spent ten years away from Qingyu City, traveling the world. So much has changed in that time.",
  ["1001071001_18"]="These records... they were all gathered and compiled by Cang Luo while he was here.",
  ["1001071001_19"]="No, I don't.",
  ["1001071001_2"]="The \"words\" you scribes record.",
  ["1001071001_20"]="Do you know what I was reading before you arrived?",
  ["1001071001_21"]="For a long moment, the two lock eyes. The scribe stands silent, waiting for the Emperor's wrath to come crashing down, but it never does. The anger in Ji Xia's eyes slowly fades, like mist disappearing in the morning sun. Then, without a word, he turns toward the bookshelf.",
  ["1001071001_22"]="The legacy of history doesn't bend to the rise and fall of fleeting power.",
  ["1001071001_23"]="Your Majesty, you and your kin may have gained immortality, but in the grand scheme of time, you're no different from the rest of us. You're just a mortal who happens to live longer, and nothing more.",
  ["1001071001_24"]="Despite the Emperor's outburst, the scribe stands his ground.",
  ["1001071001_25"]="How dare you!",
  ["1001071001_26"]="...",
  ["1001071001_27"]="What good is a death threat if your people no longer fear death? I can only hope your reign never descends to such depths.",
  ["1001071001_28"]="Your death threat doesn't even faze me. Do you really think it'll work on your subjects? They've been trampled on and pushed to the extreme edge of survival already!",
  ["1001071001_29"]="A tyrant is akin to a tiger. People might flee in fear of its claws, but when there's no escape and survival is the only choice, even the weakest will fight back, even if it means facing the beast barehanded until one of them falls.",
  ["1001071001_3"]="And yet, your mentor created something far more powerful than this seal, something even an emperor must fear...",
  ["1001071001_30"]="He takes a step forward, standing face to face with the supreme Emperor.",
  ["1001071001_31"]="Besides...",
  ["1001071001_32"]="These are the teachings my mentor passed down to me, and I will uphold them and pass them on to my students, ensuring the spirit of the historian lives on.",
  ["1001071001_33"]="Recording history means telling the truth without fear or bias, without adding or hiding anything. It's not about flattery or cover-ups; it's about recording events exactly as they happened. That's what \"history\" is all about.",
  ["1001071001_34"]="The term \"history\" refers to past events that will be spoken of by countless voices and spread far and wide. The scribe, with steady hand and pen, captures these events, ensuring that what is written remains accurate and enduring, allowing the past to live on and be known.",
  ["1001071001_35"]="The word \"history\" was first created by Cang Luo, the Grand Scribe.",
  ["1001071001_36"]="Tell me, how many executioners do you have? Enough to silence every person in the world who can read and write?",
  ["1001071001_37"]="Even if you kill that scribe, and the one after that, and the one after that, the truth will still be recorded and remembered.",
  ["1001071001_38"]="If I die, another scribe will take my place and record your deeds just the same.",
  ["1001071001_39"]="Your Majesty, your executioners may take my head, but they can't take away the sense of justice in the hearts of the people.",
  ["1001071001_4"]="Any decree sealed with it holds the full authority of the Emperor's will. No one would dare defy it.",
  ["1001071001_40"]="The scribe simply chuckles.",
  ["1001071001_41"]="Do you realize that with just one word, I could have my guards take your head?",
  ["1001071001_42"]="Quite the bold words.",
  ["1001071001_43"]="...",
  ["1001071001_44"]="And one day, those memories will become part of history. Long after you're gone, your descendants will know who you really were, and they'll judge the legacy you left behind.",
  ["1001071001_45"]="Every thought and action of yours, once said or done, will be seen and remembered by others.",
  ["1001071001_46"]="Your Majesty, you may rule the world, and your command may be absolute, but there are some things even your power can't sway.",
  ["1001071001_47"]="But the young scribe does not flinch. He stares back at the Emperor, unfazed and resolute.",
  ["1001071001_48"]="So what if it's true? I'm the Emperor, the ruler of all the lands, the highest authority on earth. And you, a mere scribe, think you can lecture me?",
  ["1001071001_49"]="Ji Xia's expression hardens for the first time, his sharp gaze barely concealing his anger.",
  ["1001071001_5"]="Do you see that? Your mentor carved that seal for me with his own hands.",
  ["1001071001_50"]="What do you know? Just because you've read a few things written by others, you think you can pass judgment and decide what's right or wrong?",
  ["1001071001_51"]="How dare you speak so insolently.",
  ["1001071001_52"]="...",
  ["1001071001_53"]="If it was truly your decision to execute Li Jun, destroy the Tianli clan, build extravagant palaces, and drain the people dry with your taxes, then history will never forget your name. You will be remembered as a symbol of tyranny for eternity!",
  ["1001071001_54"]="Forgive me for speaking so bluntly, but the ruler I see before me is nothing like the Emperor my mentor described.",
  ["1001071001_55"]="And why is it that, in recent years, the imperial family has grown greedier, drowning the people in endless taxes and levies, leaving them without means of livelihood, yet Your Majesty does nothing to stop it?",
  ["1001071001_56"]="Why is it that, now when the Tianli clan is on the brink of death, you're choosing to do nothing?",
  ["1001071001_57"]="The records also mention that Your Majesty and Li Jun were close friends, which is why, when Your Majesty set out on your travels, you entrusted Li Jun to rule in your stead.",
  ["1001071001_58"]="His records describe Li Jun as a man of unyielding integrity, someone who stood by his principles. Although I never had the chance to meet him, I deeply admire his character.",
  ["1001071001_59"]="Because my mentor recorded Li Jun's story.",
  ["1001071001_6"]="Ji Xia's gaze shifts to the top shelf, where an open box sits. Inside is a jade seal.",
  ["1001071001_60"]="If you don't know him, and you've got no ties to him or his clan, why are you even pleading on their behalf?",
  ["1001071001_61"]="I've never met him in person.",
  ["1001071001_62"]="By the time I started studying under my mentor, Li Jun had already passed away.",
  ["1001071001_63"]="When Li Jun served as regent, I was just a child.",
  ["1001071001_64"]="No... not at all.",
  ["1001071001_65"]="The scribe freezes for a second.",
  ["1001071001_66"]="Tell me, are you close to Li Jun... or to the Tianli clan?",
  ["1001071001_67"]="...",
  ["1001071001_68"]="The Tianli clan holds thousands of innocent lives. Mortals are fleeting, their lives as short as morning dew. I implore you, Your Majesty, for the sake of the bond you once shared with Li Jun, please spare them!",
  ["1001071001_69"]="Even the smallest whispers in the court are things a scribe should keep track of.",
  ["1001071001_7"]="No, it's not your defiance that surprises me.",
  ["1001071001_70"]="Your Majesty, people's words, actions, and way of life are all a part of history. What is recorded today becomes the past, shaping the future as it's written into the annals of history.",
  ["1001071001_71"]="So this is the kind of disciple Cang Luo is raising now? The kind that gets involved in idle gossip? Since when is that the job of a scribe?",
  ["1001071001_72"]="There's been talk within the royal family lately. Word is, once the Immortal Realm is completed, it'll become a palace where the imperial bloodline can live forever. And when it's finished, every craftsman from the Tianli family will be put to death to make sure the secret of immortality never gets out.",
  ["1001071001_73"]="Word is spreading that the Tianli clan is building an \"immortal realm\" for the imperial family...",
  ["1001071001_74"]="Have mercy?",
  ["1001071001_75"]="Please, Your Majesty, have mercy on the Tianli clan!",
  ["1001071001_76"]="The scribe drops into a deep bow.",
  ["1001071001_77"]="Your Majesty... there is one more matter I must bring to your attention.",
  ["1001071001_78"]="What is it? Is there anything else?",
  ["1001071001_79"]="But the Grand Scribe stays still.",
  ["1001071001_8"]="Please forgive my insolence, Your Majesty.",
  ["1001071001_80"]="That will be all. You can leave now.",
  ["1001071001_81"]="You should be familiar with the way to the Grand Scribe's chamber. Since Cang Luo left, the position's been vacant, and everything inside the chamber is just as he left it. If you need anything, just let the Prime Minister know.",
  ["1001071001_82"]="Ji Xia turns away, facing the bookshelf again.",
  ["1001071001_83"]="He didn't say anything about the court... or Your Majesty.",
  ["1001071001_84"]="The scribe hesitates for a moment.",
  ["1001071001_85"]="He did... but they were for his family.",
  ["1001071001_86"]="Did he leave any last words?",
  ["1001071001_87"]="No, he passed away peacefully in his sleep.",
  ["1001071001_88"]="Did he suffer before he died?",
  ["1001071001_89"]="So, Cang Luo is gone.",
  ["1001071001_9"]="Although... I must say, I'm a bit surprised.",
  ["1001071001_90"]="I see.",
  ["1001071001_91"]="When Ji Xia hears about Cang Luo's death, a quick flash of sorrow crosses his face, but it is gone in an instant, replaced by his usual composure.",
  ["1001071001_92"]="I'm sorry, Your Majesty... My mentor passed away not long ago. I had to take care of his funeral before I could come to the capital.",
  ["1001071001_93"]="So you're the one who's taking over as the Grand Scribe. Why didn't you come to the palace earlier?",
  ["1001071001_94"]="Yes. Cang Luo was my mentor. He has now entrusted his duties to me.",
  ["1001071001_95"]="Hmm? You look kinda familiar... Oh, you were Cang Luo's assistant, right?",
  ["1001071001_96"]="Hearing footsteps, Ji Xia, who is standing by a bookshelf, turns around.",
  ["1001071001_97"]="Not daring to look at the strange imperial guard any longer, the scribe hurries into the chamber.",
  ["1001071001_98"]="N—No, thank you.",
  ["1001071001_99"]="When the guard speaks of the Emperor, his voice is filled with reverence. But as he looks down at the frail scribe, his rigid expression reveals nothing but disdain and irritation.",
  ["1001071102_1"]="I'm fine, Yuli. Don't hurt him.",
  ["1001071102_10"]="Whoa, whoa, let's all calm down.",
  ["1001071102_11"]="Wait, that's not what he meant.",
  ["1001071102_12"]="Li Chi's eyes shoot past both of them and lock onto me.",
  ["1001071102_13"]="Or more specifically, onto the Imperial Seal in my hands.",
  ["1001071102_14"]="Give me the jade seal.",
  ["1001071102_2"]="Yes, Master Yuanquan.",
  ["1001071102_3"]="A girl suddenly appears beside Yuanquan, as if materializing out of thin air. The massive female puppet she commands gives a nod, but she doesn't lower her weapon.",
  ["1001071102_4"]="Whoa, whoa, hold up! Isn't that Li Chi? What the heck, man? It's only been a couple of hours, and now you're pulling weapons on us?",
  ["1001071102_5"]="Li Chi turns to us, his gaze cold and full of hostility. Whatever kindness he showed me under last night's starlit sky is now completely gone.",
  ["1001071102_6"]="Give it back.",
  ["1001071102_7"]="Xin and Azi, standing in front of me, have obviously misunderstood something. They both start talking fast as if they are about to take off.",
  ["1001071102_8"]="Huh?! Wait—okay... Fine, maybe I ate a little more than I should have, but you guys said it was on the house! No take-backs!",
  ["1001071102_9"]="What?! I grabbed a few silver trinkets and crafts, yeah, but seriously, those were just cheap mass-produced stuff! The guys there were basically shoving them at me, asking me to help promote them!",
  ["1001071201_1"]="That night, the Big Dipper hangs in the sky, its handle pointing east, as a gentle wind whispers in from the southeast.",
  ["1001071201_10"]="As soon as those words leave his mouth, his stomach rumbles loudly with hunger.",
  ["1001071201_100"]="But... what about the ancestral law?",
  ["1001071201_101"]="Li Chi draws his longsword and runs the blade across his fingertip.",
  ["1001071201_102"]="A drop of blood trickles down the gleaming blade, leaving a thin streak of crimson along its narrow edge.",
  ["1001071201_104"]="When stained with the blood of his descendant, the blade becomes Zhupi anew.",
  ["1001071201_105"]="Long ago, the Lord of Weaponry forged Zhupi to end harsh laws, severe punishments, and needless formalities.",
  ["1001071201_106"]="Gather your things. We move now.",
  ["1001071201_107"]="As the 297th Patriarch of the Tianli clan, and in the name of Zhupi, I hereby invoke the Lord of Weaponry's authority and abolish the decree forbidding us from leaving QingYu City!",
  ["1001071201_108"]="His word is final. Without a second thought, the Tianli clan quickly gathers only what they need and starts making their way down from Mount Tianque.",
  ["1001071201_109"]="Amidst the rush, an elder calls Li Chi aside.",
  ["1001071201_11"]="The stranger chuckles.",
  ["1001071201_111"]="Patriarch, I know this isn't the time to worry about possessions, but there are a few ancestral artifacts we really ought to bring along. They're small and won't take up much space.",
  ["1001071201_112"]="You know we're responsible for preserving and protecting them. If anything happens, it won't just be our problem. The Bureau of Cultural Relics will have our heads for it!",
  ["1001071201_113"]="You know... I'm not trying to add to your stress at a time like this, but you know as well as I do that our finances aren't in great shape. If we get fined on top of this, well... we'll have to take it out of your pocket money.",
  ["1001071201_114"]="The elder watches with quiet satisfaction as Li Chi's expression sours.",
  ["1001071201_116"]="Fine! I'll send someone to get them!",
  ["1001071201_117"]="And so, for the first time in history, the Tianli people, supporting their elders and guiding their children, depart from Qingyu City in a grand, sweeping procession.",
  ["1001071201_118"]="Before long, almost everyone has left, with only a few staying behind to wrap things up.",
  ["1001071201_119"]="Why is it taking them so long to get back?",
  ["1001071201_12"]="Does it matter who I am? Eat something first. A growing kid like you shouldn't be hungry.",
  ["1001071201_120"]="As soon as the words leave his mouth, several young Tianli clansmen come running toward him from deep within their ancestral home, their faces pale with panic.",
  ["1001071201_122"]="Li Chi... no, Patriarch!",
  ["1001071201_123"]="That thing! The one we keep in the ancestral temple! It's gone!",
  ["1001071201_124"]="Li Chi's pupils shrink in an instant.",
  ["1001071201_126"]="The one in the shrine... Do you mean...",
  ["1001071201_127"]="Yes, that thing! We searched everywhere, checked the entire inventory, and everything else is accounted for except that!",
  ["1001071201_128"]="...",
  ["1001071201_129"]="Forget it. We don't have time for a full search right now. Just go.",
  ["1001071201_13"]="Though, all I've got is some cold food, so don't eat too fast, or you'll upset your stomach.",
  ["1001071201_130"]="But—",
  ["1001071201_131"]="We'll look for it later.",
  ["1001071201_132"]="Once the last of the clansmen have evacuated, Li Chi finally has a moment to gather his scattered thoughts.",
  ["1001071201_133"]="Standing in front of the wide-open gates of the ancestral home, he gazes at the empty courtyard, his mind racing as the events of the past few days replay over and over.",
  ["1001071201_134"]="Eventually, his thoughts settle on two outsiders who could only be described as \"unwelcome guests.\"",
  ["1001071201_135"]="So it was you...",
  ["1001071201_136"]="An Old Friend",
  ["1001071201_14"]="Easy there, kid! You eat like you haven't seen food in a week. Here, drink some water before you choke.",
  ["1001071201_15"]="Today is Qingming Festival. I'm here to clean up the tombstone and pay my respects.",
  ["1001071201_16"]="Hmm... you could say that. What about you? Why is a kid like you out here all alone in the middle of the night? Don't tell me you're out for a midnight stroll.",
  ["1001071201_17"]="Oh? Punished? At this time of year... don't tell me you broke some kind of ancestral taboo?",
  ["1001071201_18"]="A reward? What kind of reward?",
  ["1001071201_19"]="Seriously? These rules are kinda ridiculous. They won't even let a kid go on a spring trip? Like, who does that? Taking away the simple joy of eating snacks on a bus? Sounds like a bunch of stubborn old fossils to me.",
  ["1001071201_2"]="A fine mist-like drizzle blankets the bamboo forest in a delicate veil.",
  ["1001071201_20"]="Don't worry. Sooner or later, you'll be free from all these burdens and responsibilities.",
  ["1001071201_21"]="...",
  ["1001071201_22"]="His body aches with exhaustion, his stomach twists with hunger, and the stranger's eyes are so kind. As for all the rules and teachings the elders drilled into him—ugh, screw them. Isn't it because he didn't follow their endless rules that he was thrown out here, freezing on the back mountain, abandoned like a stray dog?",
  ["1001071201_23"]="The internal struggle lasts about three seconds before he grabs the green rice ball from the stranger's hand and scarfs it down like a starving beast.",
  ["1001071201_24"]="Mmmf—mmgh—ack—!",
  ["1001071201_25"]="*Gulp*",
  ["1001071201_26"]="The boy snatches the bamboo canteen from the stranger's hand and gulps the water down, not stopping until every last drop is gone. Only then does he smack his lips, satisfied.",
  ["1001071201_27"]="Did you get lost?",
  ["1001071201_28"]="Thanks, but... um, this is the Tianli clan's rear mountain. What are you doing here?",
  ["1001071201_29"]="Clean up the tombstone? Whose tombstone? This land's always been part of the Tianli clan's territory. Is your friend from our clan?",
  ["1001071201_3"]="A young boy sits on the branch of a short tree, his eyes welling with tears.",
  ["1001071201_30"]="The boy is still young. Without thinking, he falls for it and lets the stranger change the subject.",
  ["1001071201_31"]="A stroll? Kinda weird way to put it. Who just goes out for a stroll in the middle of the night? I got in trouble, so now I'm stuck here guarding this place as punishment.",
  ["1001071201_32"]="What? No! I actually did exactly what they told me to do today! But when I asked for a reward, they got all mad at me.",
  ["1001071201_33"]="My class is going on a trip to CangLin City this weekend. I really wanted to go, but they wouldn't sign my permission slip.",
  ["1001071201_34"]="And then they gave me that same lecture again about how as the future clan leader, I can't take the rules so lightly. Ugh, like have they ever even asked if I want to be their stupid leader?",
  ["1001071201_35"]="Three years. Three whole years, and I haven't been allowed to go on a single spring trip! Not even the autumn outings! So yeah, I talked back a little... and next thing I knew, they sent me here as punishment.",
  ["1001071201_36"]="It's been years, and every single time, it's the same excuse: \"No one in our clan is allowed to step outside Qingyu City.\"",
  ["1001071201_37"]="His nose tingles, and before he realizes it, all the frustration he's been holding in just comes pouring out as he spills his heart to a stranger he's barely known for ten minutes.",
  ["1001071201_38"]="The stranger picks up on his frustration and tries to comfort him.",
  ["1001071201_39"]="The boy angrily swats the stranger's hand off his shoulder.",
  ["1001071201_4"]="A soft whimper, like the sound of a small, wounded animal, comes from his throat, but he stubbornly keeps his head tilted toward the Northern Dipper, refusing to let a single tear fall.",
  ["1001071201_40"]="What do you know?! Don't talk bad about our rules! Our clan has our own way of life! And we don't need some outsider telling us what to do! But... *Sniff*",
  ["1001071201_41"]="Even as he says that, the weight of it all sinks in. No matter how hard he tries to defend his clan, the unfairness just hurts too much. His lips quiver, and before he can stop himself—",
  ["1001071201_42"]="He breaks down, sobbing. Loud, gut-wrenching cries echo through the mountains, sending a flock of night crows flapping into the sky.",
  ["1001071201_43"]="...",
  ["1001071201_44"]="After a while...",
  ["1001071201_45"]="The crying gradually quiets down, though the occasional sniffle still breaks the silence.",
  ["1001071201_46"]="As the night grows darker, a lone lantern casts a cold glow through the rain, while the damp bamboo sways in the mist.",
  ["1001071201_47"]="The stranger suddenly sets down the lantern and rummages through his clothes for a moment before pulling out a bamboo flute.",
  ["1001071201_48"]="The boy stops sniffling and stares at him blankly.",
  ["1001071201_49"]="The stranger presses his lips to the flute's mouthpiece. A moment later, discordant, ear-splitting screech fills the air.",
  ["1001071201_5"]="A gentle breeze rustles through the bamboo, bringing with it the presence of a stranger who felt strangely familiar, like an old acquaintance.",
  ["1001071201_50"]="Squeak—Screech—Squeak—",
  ["1001071201_51"]="The stranger lets out a quiet sigh, adjusts his grip, and tries again.",
  ["1001071201_52"]="Squeak—Screech—Squeak—",
  ["1001071201_53"]="The boy snivels, and tears once again well up in his eyes.",
  ["1001071201_54"]="But seriously, no matter how mad you are, that's no excuse to torture my ears like this.",
  ["1001071201_55"]="I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you earlier. You gave me food and water, and I let my temper get the best of me.",
  ["1001071201_56"]="Let me try.",
  ["1001071201_57"]="No, but I learned how to play the recorder at school. It's probably not that different.",
  ["1001071201_58"]="That was a song from my clan. Pretty good, huh?",
  ["1001071201_59"]="Meant to be with me? This wasn't mine to begin with. I can't just take it.",
  ["1001071201_6"]="There, there. Whose kid is out here crying all alone?",
  ["1001071201_60"]="...",
  ["1001071201_61"]="...",
  ["1001071201_62"]="The stranger lowers the flute.",
  ["1001071201_64"]="Ah, was it really that bad? I've been practicing for years...",
  ["1001071201_65"]="The boy shoots the stranger a disdainful look as he extends his hand.",
  ["1001071201_66"]="Oh? You know how to play?",
  ["1001071201_67"]="The stranger hands the bamboo flute to the boy. He fumbles for a moment, not quite used to holding it sideways, but then quickly finds his grip and places his fingers over the holes with a natural ease.",
  ["1001071201_68"]="Without hesitation, he closes his eyes and begins to play.",
  ["1001071201_69"]="...",
  ["1001071201_7"]="The boy stiffens, sniffles, and turns toward the sound of the voice.",
  ["1001071201_70"]="...",
  ["1001071201_71"]="A soft, lilting melody fills the air, drifting through the moonlight and blending effortlessly with the rustling bamboo leaves.",
  ["1001071201_72"]="Red butterflies flutter out of the forest, twirling gracefully as if they are dancing to the music.",
  ["1001071201_73"]="As the last note fades, the boy lifts his chin with pride and hands the flute back to the stranger.",
  ["1001071201_74"]="But the stranger doesn't take it. Instead, he smiles warmly at the boy.",
  ["1001071201_75"]="It was beautiful. Keep the flute, it's meant to be with you.",
  ["1001071201_76"]="Here you go. Now, don't tell me one little song is all it takes to make you this smug. Come on, you've got more than just one in you, right?",
  ["1001071201_77"]="Take care of it. It's been through a lot over the years, but now, it's finally where it belongs.",
  ["1001071201_78"]="Starting today, it is yours.",
  ["1001071201_79"]="The boy lets out a sharp huff through his nose.",
  ["1001071201_8"]="A single, dim lantern flickers in the cold, casting just enough light to reveal half of the stranger's face.",
  ["1001071201_80"]="He lifts the flute to his lips and begins to play again.",
  ["1001071201_81"]="...",
  ["1001071201_82"]="A soft breeze ruffles the waves under a sky full of stars.",
  ["1001071201_83"]="The melody drifts through the starry sky, fading only as the rising sun chases away the night's chill.",
  ["1001071201_84"]="The next day.",
  ["1001071201_85"]="The boy wakes beneath a tree.",
  ["1001071201_86"]="He looks around, but the stranger and the red butterfly are both gone.",
  ["1001071201_87"]="The bamboo flute is the only thing left in his hands, a quiet reminder that last night was more than just a dream.",
  ["1001071201_88"]="He hesitates for a moment, then tucks the flute close to his chest and holds it tight.",
  ["1001071201_89"]="At that moment, he couldn't have known that many years later, as the clan leader, when his people look to him in fear and uncertainty, the first memory that comes to his mind would be the night the stranger gave him the flute.",
  ["1001071201_9"]="Who are you?",
  ["1001071201_90"]="Even now, he still vividly remembers those deep green eyes, filled with a sorrow as heavy as a mountain, yet radiating warmth all the same.",
  ["1001071201_91"]="But why now? Why remember that moment at a time like this?",
  ["1001071201_92"]="Maybe it is because the stranger who just saved his life has the same eyes.",
  ["1001071201_93"]="His people stand before him, anxious and afraid as the relentless earthquakes shakes the land. However, not a single one suggests leaving, all because of the clan rule: \"The Tianli clan must never leave QingYu City.\"",
  ["1001071201_94"]="Li Chi takes a deep breath and turns to face them all.",
  ["1001071201_95"]="My people.",
  ["1001071201_96"]="We are leaving Qingyu City. Now.",
  ["1001071201_97"]="The people exchange bewildered glances.",
  ["1001071201_98"]="Brother Chi...?",
  ["1001071201_99"]="Chi... Li Chi? Are you serious?",
  ["1001071301_1"]="Hand over the jade seal.",
  ["1001071301_10"]="...",
  ["1001071301_11"]="Together? Heh, how ridiculous! Ji Xia is but a backstabbing rat! He exiled us and tarnished our First Ancestor's name.",
  ["1001071301_12"]="If it weren't for him, our clan wouldn't be restricted to such a remote corner...",
  ["1001071301_13"]="Who do you think you are, your pompous old man? What makes you think you can...",
  ["1001071301_14"]="You...",
  ["1001071301_16"]="I glance at the jade seal in my hand, intending to say something, but a commotion erupts behind me.",
  ["1001071301_17"]="As a lightning bolt, Li Chi swiftly dashes past Azi and Xin, unleashing a slash at me.",
  ["1001071301_18"]="Li Chi's blade finds its mark—not me, but a frenzied ape attempting to attack me.",
  ["1001071301_19"]="I lower my hand, signaling Zero, and nod at Li Chi.",
  ["1001071301_20"]="Li Chi seems somewhat surprised as he catches the jade seal I toss towards him. The words he intends to speak gets stuck in his throat as he observes the imprints on the seal.",
  ["1001071301_22"]="Despite Li Chi's evident fury, Yuanquan maintains his composure.",
  ["1001071301_23"]="Yuanquan responds with a gentle smile.",
  ["1001071301_24"]="His words leave Li Chi speechless.",
  ["1001071301_25"]="Yuanquan then directs his gaze towards me.",
  ["1001071301_26"]="Wait, there's one more of them.",
  ["1001071301_28"]="Okay, we might have overstayed our welcome a bit, but that doesn't make us thieves. That's just unfair.",
  ["1001071301_29"]="That's right. So, how about giving our seal back to us?",
  ["1001071301_3"]="...",
  ["1001071301_30"]="Seer...",
  ["1001071301_32"]="\"Only through perfect balance can moral order be achieved; only through benevolence comes sanctity.\" Justice will prevail at the heart of the world.",
  ["1001071301_33"]="Please hand the jade seal to His Excellency, esteemed Head Librarian. It's alright.",
  ["1001071301_35"]="Together, they were the bedrock of the Xia Dynasty's steadfast reign.",
  ["1001071301_36"]="As for the one with \"Justice of the World,\" it was carried by Li Jun during his regency. It bound its holder to uphold justice and act in the Emperor's name.",
  ["1001071301_37"]="Both were crafted by Cang Luo, the first scribe ever. The one with the words \"Heart of the World\" were once owned by the Emperor. It meant he was the heart of the world, and his word was law.",
  ["1001071301_38"]="Truth is, there were two jade seals from the beginning: the one with \"Heart of the World\" possessed by Ji Xia, and the one with \"Justice of the World\" carried by Li Jun.",
  ["1001071301_39"]="I believe you've realized it: your resentment is ingrained and thus meaningless. That's why you keep cursing everything about Ji Xia —to convince yourselves that your belief is real.",
  ["1001071301_4"]="Hand back the jade seal. Now. Or else...",
  ["1001071301_40"]="Your Tianli Clan clings to an ancient rule, \"The Tianli clan must never leave QingYu City.\" However, none of you know why your First Ancestor decreed it. You follow it blindly, just like how you cling to your hatred of Ji Xia and his legacy.",
  ["1001071301_41"]="Your hatred is hollow, Patriarch of the Tianli Clan. Your words and actions lack conviction, even to yourself.",
  ["1001071301_42"]="Because I can give your hollow hatred a solid reason.",
  ["1001071301_43"]="The Eternal Palace's rise was also the immortals' fall.",
  ["1001071301_44"]="Well, let me tell you how this story ends.",
  ["1001071301_45"]="Surely you've realized that the First Emperor wasn't the only one who gained immortality, right?",
  ["1001071301_46"]="Exactly. It doesn't hold the key—it is the key.",
  ["1001071301_47"]="Head Librarian, didn't you once ask why I sought this artifact now, of all times?",
  ["1001071301_48"]="Whoa, bro! What's got you all fired up? You're throwing around accusations like fireworks. Even us Tang Sect folks aren't that trigger-happy.",
  ["1001071301_5"]="...Heh, misunderstanding, you say? I took you in, and you repay me by stealing my clan's sacred treasure?",
  ["1001071301_50"]="I've got no clue about your \"ancestral seal,\" but the one you're holding? We went all through that massive royal palace before we found it.",
  ["1001071301_51"]="Hmm? Justice of the World?",
  ["1001071301_53"]="So, there are two jade seals?... What's going on here, Master Yuanquan?",
  ["1001071301_54"]="...",
  ["1001071301_55"]="Thank you.",
  ["1001071301_56"]="Seems like there's some misunderstanding here.",
  ["1001071301_57"]="Alright, if you say so.",
  ["1001071301_58"]="Sure.",
  ["1001071301_59"]="Here you go, Patriarch.",
  ["1001071301_6"]="...Heh, don't get me wrong. My clan plays it straight—no underhanded tricks.",
  ["1001071301_66"]="You said it held the key to my final question.",
  ["1001071301_67"]="You promised to explain everything.",
  ["1001071301_69"]="Where did those immortals go?",
  ["1001071301_7"]="Huh? You...",
  ["1001071301_70"]="Does the Eternal Palace really exist?",
  ["1001071301_73"]="A few moments later.",
  ["1001071301_74"]="As we bid farewell to Yuanquan, the group, who has learned the truth of the Eternal Palace, bears varied expressions.",
  ["1001071301_76"]="But what exactly is his plan? One moment he's infecting people with Cerulean Water, and the next he's reopening the Eternal Hall...",
  ["1001071301_77"]="So, Ji Xia's true target is the Eternal Hall. No wonder we haven't seen him this whole time.",
  ["1001071301_78"]="...Huh? Isn't that the most basic scam?! Did you actually fall for it?",
  ["1001071301_79"]="...",
  ["1001071301_8"]="No... not this one! It's the \"Heart of the World,\" not the \"Justice of the World\"!",
  ["1001071301_80"]="Anyway! Ji Xia's definitely plotting something huge! He can't seriously be gathering a bronze army to take over the world, right?",
  ["1001071301_81"]="By the way, bro, don't you have something to say?",
  ["1001071301_82"]="Easy fix! Let's check your clan's sacred lands, then we'll know if Master Yuanquan was telling the truth.",
  ["1001071301_84"]="Ah, I know that! I got a call earlier, and the guy said, \"Hello there! This is Ji Xia. I'm still alive, and I'll reclaim my throne with 100,000 terracotta warriors. Wire me $2,000, and I'll name you my right-hand man once I'm back to my throne.\"",
  ["1001071301_85"]="I couldn't figure out mobile banking, so I asked Qing for help, and she ended up uprooting the whole fraud ring.",
  ["1001071301_87"]="With the way things are looking, I'm worried Ji Xia might have already made it to the Eternal Hall. We've got to find him as soon as possible.",
  ["1001071301_88"]="Seriously, what's even going through your head...?",
  ["1001071301_89"]="If that's really his grand plan, why wait thousands of years?",
  ["1001071301_9"]="This isn't our seal at all! Where did you hide our ancestral seal?",
  ["1001071301_91"]="But I won't fully believe Yuanquan's tale until I check it out myself.",
  ["1001071301_92"]="I'm sorry.",
  ["1001071301_93"]="I shouldn't have snapped without hearing the full story.",
  ["1001071301_94"]="...",
  ["1001071301_95"]="Sacred Land",
  ["1001071302_10"]="The gate stands closed now, but nearby marks suggest it was recently opened.",
  ["1001071302_11"]="Carefully, I retrieve the seal and align it with the gate's engraved pattern.",
  ["1001071302_12"]="Just as Ming said, its shape matches the indentation exactly.",
  ["1001071302_13"]="Taking a deep breath, I slide the seal into the groove.",
  ["1001071302_14"]="A low rumble echoes as the gate grinds open, unveiling a dark passage ahead.",
  ["1001071302_15"]="Li Chi watches silently, his expression growing somewhat complicated.",
  ["1001071302_16"]="Let me give it a shot.",
  ["1001071302_17"]="Looks like... it's working.",
  ["1001071302_19"]="Who was that person?",
  ["1001071302_2"]="Even I have never stepped foot inside.",
  ["1001071302_20"]="However, before the hall's completion, someone freed the captive Tianli people, returned the \"Justice of the World\" jade to them, and led them away from the Eternal Hall.",
  ["1001071302_21"]="After Li Jun's demise, the royal family took the \"Justice of the World\" seal. They modeled the hall's entrance after the seal's shape, making the two seals the keys to open the hall.",
  ["1001071302_22"]="The royal family compelled the skilled craftsmen of the Tianli clan to construct the palace. On its completion, the clan was to be sacrificed as an offering to the heavens.",
  ["1001071302_23"]="The construction had to be kept entirely secret from the outside world. Carving a city inside a mountain was not easy feat, so only skilled craftsmen like those of the Tianli clan were allowed.",
  ["1001071302_24"]="The Eternal Hall sits at the heart of Mount Tianque, below Heavenly Lake, known as the \"Heart of the World.\"",
  ["1001071302_25"]="Indeed, the mysterious Eternal Hall truly exists. It's a hideaway crafted by the immortal royal family to live forever in seclusion.",
  ["1001071302_26"]="Every generation of the Tianli Clan abides by this rule, because you're not just grave diggers, but also the tomb keepers.",
  ["1001071302_27"]="While this ancient rule was initially set by Li Jun, you didn't follow it merely because he was your First Ancestor.",
  ["1001071302_28"]="Your clan upholds an ancient rule, \"The Tianli clan must never leave QingYu City.\"",
  ["1001071302_29"]="The Eternal Palace's rise was also the immortals' fall.",
  ["1001071302_3"]="The door's recent. Behind it lies a stone gate.",
  ["1001071302_30"]="Well, let me tell you how this story ends.",
  ["1001071302_31"]="Well, it was someone who turned the eternal sanctuary into a tomb.",
  ["1001071302_4"]="Huh? It's just a flimsy wooden door. How's this supposed to keep anything inside?",
  ["1001071302_5"]="See? Told you Master Yuanquan was telling the truth.",
  ["1001071302_6"]="So, the entrance to the Eternal Hall is actually hidden in the Tianli clan's sacred lands.",
  ["1001071302_7"]="The carving on this gate... it's shaped like the jade seal.",
  ["1001071302_8"]="With a casual swing of his blade, Li Chi splits the wooden door apart.",
  ["1001071302_9"]="True to expectation, an ancient stone gate comes into view, tall and unyielding, etched with the weathered marks of time as though a gateway to another realm.",
  ["1001071401_1"]="A path paved with injustice can only lead to ruin.",
  ["1001071401_10"]="You're giving me too much credit. I'm not some all-knowing god who can predict every little thing.",
  ["1001071401_100"]="The stench that fills the place and the endless echoes of cursing voices drown out the faint melody of string music drifting down from the grand halls above.",
  ["1001071401_101"]="Deep within the paradise, in a hidden dungeon.",
  ["1001071401_102"]="If you drag this out, your head will roll right along with the clansmen's.",
  ["1001071401_103"]="Enough talk. Those \"immortals\" will be drinking and feasting all night. They won't be paying attention to anything else. Let's get this done while they're distracted.",
  ["1001071401_104"]="...",
  ["1001071401_105"]="As for the Tianli clan, now that they're no longer useful but know far too much... what do you think will become of them?",
  ["1001071401_106"]="Tomorrow, the royals will cut all ties with the mortal world and move into their eternal sanctuary.",
  ["1001071401_107"]="Now that the Eternal Palace is finally complete, the Tianli clan has outlived its purpose.",
  ["1001071401_108"]="Beneath every single patch of land in this paradise lies a Tianli clansman, bled dry.",
  ["1001071401_109"]="Well, now you have. They're here, forced to dig tunnels and build palaces for the royal family.",
  ["1001071401_11"]="Wait... you mean, you saw this whole confrontation coming all along?",
  ["1001071401_110"]="I know you've been looking into the Tianli clan. You've noticed how so many of them have disappeared without a trace, but no matter how hard you searched, you never found out where they went.",
  ["1001071401_111"]="The royal family has been working on this place for years. It's a utopia where those blessed with immortality can live forever.",
  ["1001071401_112"]="This is the so-called \"paradise.\" A sanctuary untouched by commoners.",
  ["1001071401_113"]="Who else? I gave the order.",
  ["1001071401_114"]="Who could've pulled something like this off and kept it a complete secret?",
  ["1001071401_115"]="You should consider yourself lucky you didn't know. If you had found out earlier, you wouldn't have lived to see tomorrow.",
  ["1001071401_116"]="What... what is this place? A secret like this has been under Qingyu City this whole time, and I never knew?",
  ["1001071401_117"]="At last, they reach the end of the tunnel, and what awaits them is an unbelievable \"spectacle\".",
  ["1001071401_118"]="Torches along the walls cast long, twisted shadows of them. The scribe grows more uneasy, asking questions over and over, but Ji Xia simply ignores him and keeps moving.",
  ["1001071401_119"]="The two of them step into a hidden tunnel that descends deep into the mountain. The passage spirals downward into darkness.",
  ["1001071401_12"]="Cang Luo really did raise a good one. Bringing you here wasn't a bad call after all.",
  ["1001071401_120"]="We need to get this done before dawn.",
  ["1001071401_121"]="We've wasted enough time already.",
  ["1001071401_122"]="Ji Xia does not answer. Instead, he looks up at the path ahead.",
  ["1001071401_123"]="I... I still don't get what you mean.",
  ["1001071401_124"]="Then I'll give you a chance. A chance to change their fate.",
  ["1001071401_125"]="Aren't you always poking your nose into the Tianli clan's affairs?",
  ["1001071401_126"]="You ask too many questions.",
  ["1001071401_127"]="So... why'd you call me out here in the middle of the night, and keep it a secret from everyone else?",
  ["1001071401_128"]="Where does this path lead? Are we heading down the mountain?",
  ["1001071401_129"]="Huff... Huff... Well, I am a civil official, after all.",
  ["1001071401_13"]="Hey, kid, I owe you a thank you.",
  ["1001071401_130"]="The first time Li Jun and I climbed to the summit of Mount Tianque, your mentor, Cang Luo, looked just about the same as you do now.",
  ["1001071401_131"]="*Sigh*",
  ["1001071401_132"]="The figure ahead finally pauses.",
  ["1001071401_133"]="P—Please slow down! I... I'm not built for running!",
  ["1001071401_134"]="Your Majesty?",
  ["1001071401_135"]="Your Majesty...",
  ["1001071401_136"]="Two figures make their way up a hidden mountain path on the mid-slopes of Mount Tianque.",
  ["1001071401_137"]="Night has fallen, enveloping the land in silence. All living things have long since drifted into slumber.",
  ["1001071401_138"]="Thousands of years ago, in QingYu City.",
  ["1001071401_139"]="Only half true.",
  ["1001071401_14"]="As the Tianli people disappear into the distance, Ji Xia turns to the scribe.",
  ["1001071401_140"]="Move. You know exactly what I'm gonna do.",
  ["1001071401_141"]="Dungeon",
  ["1001071401_15"]="Alright, we've wasted too much time. Let's go.",
  ["1001071401_16"]="That's from back when the Lord of Weaponry was regent. Guess it's finally back where it belongs.",
  ["1001071401_17"]="Resting in his palm is a seal. He turns it over, and on the underside, the words \"Justice of the World\" are boldly engraved.",
  ["1001071401_18"]="...!",
  ["1001071401_19"]="Ji Xia tossed a small object his way. The strongman catches it, then stops cold.",
  ["1001071401_2"]="On paths where bones silently scream, Their excess drowns in a lavish stream.",
  ["1001071401_20"]="This belongs to you. Take it back.",
  ["1001071401_21"]="The strongman turns back, his eyes still burning with clear, unhidden hatred.",
  ["1001071401_22"]="Wait.",
  ["1001071401_23"]="Led by the strongman, the Tianli people begin their exodus, supporting their elders and guiding their young as they move forward. Their eyes burn with hatred at the sight of Ji Xia, but they are too weak to do anything about it. All they can do is help each other along, making their way toward the exit above.",
  ["1001071401_24"]="Everyone, move out!",
  ["1001071401_25"]="I'll let you keep your pathetic life today, but only because of Cang Luo.",
  ["1001071401_26"]="You'd better thank this kid.",
  ["1001071401_27"]="Hey, Ji Xia.",
  ["1001071401_28"]="...",
  ["1001071401_29"]="The records tell of the Lord of Weaponry and the Emperor as he knew them, nothing more, nothing less.",
  ["1001071401_3"]="Amidst starving souls and frozen plight, Royals revel in opulent delight.",
  ["1001071401_30"]="That's the history he saw for himself.",
  ["1001071401_31"]="I believe every word he wrote.",
  ["1001071401_32"]="My mentor would never betray the words he etched into history.",
  ["1001071401_33"]="For the first time, the fear in the scribe's eyes disappears, giving way to a firm conviction.",
  ["1001071401_34"]="How much of that do you actually believe?",
  ["1001071401_35"]="...",
  ["1001071401_36"]="My mentor said, \"The Emperor is a man of great strategy and an approachable nature. He wields his sword with unmatched skill and commands hundreds of vassals with a flick of his whip. He carries the worries of the common people in his heart and truly understands their struggles. A sagacious ruler in every sense.\"",
  ["1001071401_37"]="So, what about Ji Xia? What did he say about him?",
  ["1001071401_38"]="...",
  ["1001071401_39"]="My mentor... he wrote, \"The Lord of Weaponry was a man of striking presence, with a powerful voice full of heroic spirit. Fierce as fire and ruthless against evil, he treated his soldiers with kindness but held a haughty disdain for aristocratic officials. He honored the noble-hearted yet had little regard for the wicked. A true hero among men.\"",
  ["1001071401_4"]="After the scribe leaves, Ji Xia looks up at the towering, brightly lit Eternal Palace.",
  ["1001071401_40"]="So, what did he say about Li Jun?",
  ["1001071401_41"]="Of course.",
  ["1001071401_42"]="If you are Cang Luo's student, then you must have read his records.",
  ["1001071401_43"]="He leans in, his gaze fixed on the scribe's quivering face.",
  ["1001071401_44"]="Cang Luo... He was the only one in the entire Ji clan who dared to speak up for my people, the only one who stood by Li Jun.",
  ["1001071401_45"]="The strongman goes quiet for a moment, closing his single eye as he slowly shakes his head.",
  ["1001071401_46"]="Yes... before I left for Qingyu City, I buried him myself.",
  ["1001071401_47"]="Tch... I heard Cang Luo was dead. Is that true?",
  ["1001071401_48"]="That's right. He was my mentor.",
  ["1001071401_49"]="Scribe? So, you're Cang Luo's successor?",
  ["1001071401_5"]="Yes, Your Majesty.",
  ["1001071401_50"]="I... I am the new scribe.",
  ["1001071401_51"]="Kid, who are you?",
  ["1001071401_52"]="...",
  ["1001071401_53"]="Know your place! The imperial family's affairs are beyond you, and they're none of your concern!",
  ["1001071401_54"]="How dare you speak so recklessly!",
  ["1001071401_55"]="Enough!",
  ["1001071401_56"]="A sharp voice cuts him off.",
  ["1001071401_57"]="So at the very least, Li Jun's death wasn't...",
  ["1001071401_58"]="But I found one undeniable truth. When the Regent died, the Emperor wasn't anywhere near the palace. He was miles away, not \"restoring order\" like the royal family says.",
  ["1001071401_59"]="Even His Majesty doesn't have all the answers. No one really knows what happened, especially when it comes to the Regent's death. It's still a mystery.",
  ["1001071401_6"]="No questions for now, okay?",
  ["1001071401_60"]="There are too many inconsistencies. Some things just don't add up. This part of history has been concealed and altered!",
  ["1001071401_61"]="I've gone through every record, every decree, and every archive from the years before and after Li Jun's regency and His Majesty's return.",
  ["1001071401_62"]="Things... might not be the way you think they are!",
  ["1001071401_63"]="I... I can't.",
  ["1001071401_64"]="I'll say this one last time. Move.",
  ["1001071401_65"]="However, the scribe steps in his way.",
  ["1001071401_66"]="Coward! Face me and die like a man!",
  ["1001071401_67"]="Ji Xia stays silent, turning his back on the Tianli prisoners. The strongman's anger flares, his single eye burning with rage.",
  ["1001071401_68"]="It's all on this tyrant's hands!",
  ["1001071401_69"]="My family's gone, all six of them. My clan... so many dead. The blood of the Lord of Weaponry...",
  ["1001071401_7"]="When the sun rises the day after tomorrow, meet me at the foot of the mountain.",
  ["1001071401_70"]="You... you want to get revenge on the Emperor?",
  ["1001071401_71"]="The scribe swallows hard, his face pale with fear, but he does not back down.",
  ["1001071401_72"]="If you weren't so weak, I would've ripped your head off already.",
  ["1001071401_73"]="This is personal. Get lost.",
  ["1001071401_74"]="Are you one of Ji Xia's lapdogs too?",
  ["1001071401_75"]="The one-eyed man lowers his gaze, looking down at the much smaller scribe.",
  ["1001071401_76"]="S—Stop right there! What are you trying to do?",
  ["1001071401_77"]="A burly, one-eyed man steps forward, walking straight toward Ji Xia.",
  ["1001071401_78"]="His Majesty is letting you go!",
  ["1001071401_79"]="W-why aren't you leaving?",
  ["1001071401_8"]="That said, you went beyond what I expected. You did great.",
  ["1001071401_80"]="But the Tianli prisoners stay still.",
  ["1001071401_81"]="Ji Xia takes out a bronze key and unlocks the intricate lock on the door.",
  ["1001071401_82"]="That's all I have to say. Whether you believe me or not, whether you stay or try to run, it's all up to you.",
  ["1001071401_83"]="At sunrise, the royal family will have you all executed as a sacrifice to mark the completion of the Eternal Palace.",
  ["1001071401_84"]="I won't make excuses, and you don't have to forgive me.",
  ["1001071401_85"]="He turns back to the prisoners.",
  ["1001071401_86"]="Don't judge a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes.",
  ["1001071401_87"]="Ji Xia raises a hand, stopping the scribe.",
  ["1001071401_88"]="How dare...",
  ["1001071401_89"]="The only response he gets is a wad of spit, hurled straight at his face.",
  ["1001071401_9"]="But I can make a solid guess about how people will react under certain conditions. I just put the right pieces in place and adjust as things unfold.",
  ["1001071401_90"]="I'm sorry.",
  ["1001071401_91"]="The cursing and wailing suddenly stop for a moment. A few pairs of eyes press against the bars, wide with disbelief, as if they can't quite believe that this man, of all people, would dare show his face here.",
  ["1001071401_92"]="You've suffered long enough.",
  ["1001071401_93"]="Ji Xia steps closer to the prison bars.",
  ["1001071401_94"]="The scribe struggles to gather his thoughts. The horror before him has stolen his words, leaving only broken syllables tumbling from his lips.",
  ["1001071401_95"]="Your Majesty... this...",
  ["1001071401_96"]="Countless withered, bloodied hands claw through the bars, reaching hopelessly toward the sky. In the distance, the lights of paradise shine brightly, but not a single beam of that light touches the faces of the broken souls trapped in the dark.",
  ["1001071401_97"]="The pit in front of them looks like something straight out of hell.",
  ["1001071401_98"]="...",
  ["1001071401_99"]="...",
  ["1001071501_139"]="The passage stretches narrow and deep.",
  ["1001071501_140"]="We walk in silence for an unknowable time until a dense cerulean mist approaches us like a living entity, filling the air with a pungent metallic scent.",
  ["1001071501_141"]="Gradually, a faint light emerges in the distance. As we proceed, those pale yellow halos disperse the darkness, enveloping our figures.",
  ["1001071501_142"]="The temple's chilly interior is illuminated by the scent of burning candles mingled with the crackling reminiscent of an ancient incantation.",
  ["1001071501_143"]="Stepping into the \"eternal sanctuary,\" I feel as if entering a dreamscape forgotten by time.",
  ["1001071501_144"]="Have these candles... been lit for thousands of years?",
  ["1001071501_145"]="...",
  ["1001071501_149"]="But that's just myth. These candles... they look recently lit.",
  ["1001071501_150"]="The candles are fueled by essence oil from mermaids, meant to burn forever.",
  ["1001071501_151"]="Legend has it that the constructors used mercury for tiny rivers and copied the whole world in miniature.",
  ["1001071501_152"]="Who'd have time to light every candle in this massive place...?",
  ["1001071501_153"]="Shouldn't he be your prime suspect for stealing the heirloom?",
  ["1001071501_154"]="That guy who showed up out of nowhere in your home? He's way shadier than us! Don't you think?",
  ["1001071501_155"]="We're not the only ones near your ancestral home, but why did you pin it all on us?",
  ["1001071501_156"]="Speaking of that emperor, I mean, Ji Xia... You know what's on my mind, dear Patriarch?",
  ["1001071501_157"]="Left momentarily speechless by Azi, Li Chi hesitates before murmuring a quiet reply.",
  ["1001071501_158"]="...",
  ["1001071501_159"]="But... do we actually have enough people for this?! Why didn't Master Yuanquan send more backup? He's putting way too much trust on us, don't you think?!",
  ["1001071501_161"]="Whatever he's planning, we need to find and stop him.",
  ["1001071501_162"]="No, he hasn't put any trust in you, Azi...",
  ["1001071501_163"]="Ming glances towards me and Zero.",
  ["1001071501_164"]="Zero shifts her gaze briefly towards me.",
  ["1001071501_165"]="Li Chi draws his blade.",
  ["1001071501_166"]="Time to head out.",
  ["1001071501_167"]="Let's not dwell on this. This is our sacred land, and I'll take full blame for whatever happens here.",
  ["1001071501_169"]="Hmm... Maybe the emperor raising his bronze army?",
  ["1001071501_171"]="...Maybe he's just more likable than you lot.",
  ["1001071501_172"]="...",
  ["1001071501_173"]="Can we handle this?",
  ["1001071501_174"]="Yes.",
  ["1001071501_175"]="Underground Palace",
  ["1001071701_150"]="This place is getting hotter...",
  ["1001071701_151"]="Even if those bronze zombies are immortal and have lost their human side, they can sense the heat rising, right?!",
  ["1001071701_152"]="Seriously, how did Ji Xia's architects get away with building the Eternal Hall in this oven? No protests?",
  ["1001071701_153"]="You're saying the temperature raised over the years?",
  ["1001071701_154"]="Phew, can we wrap this up? Your lecture is giving me a headache...",
  ["1001071701_155"]="What? You spilled all that and now you're saying you goofed up?",
  ["1001071701_156"]="...What will happen? We get roasted alive, obviously!",
  ["1001071701_157"]="Yeah, then what?",
  ["1001071701_158"]="When construction started, this place probably felt cool and pleasant.",
  ["1001071701_159"]="Well... that was ages ago, after all.",
  ["1001071701_160"]="Li Chi responds to Xin's question.",
  ["1001071701_161"]="That's true. The geological team sent to Mount Tianque affirmed it as a dormant volcano, hinting at active magma chambers deep down.",
  ["1001071701_162"]="Maybe there was less magma back then. Could have been cooler when Ji Xia built this place.",
  ["1001071701_163"]="Heat rises constantly. Magma accumulates, pressure builds... The lid can't hold it anymore, and BOOM—the volcano erupts.",
  ["1001071701_164"]="Think of a magma chamber like a pressure cooker—the crust is the lid, and the mantle's heat keeps building.",
  ["1001071701_165"]="One of my mentors used to say, \"Geology is all about pressure and time.\"",
  ["1001071701_167"]="Technically yes.",
  ["1001071701_168"]="...I'm sorry, but that's beyond my expertise. No one knows it for sure.",
  ["1001071701_170"]="We lack the knowledge to precisely predict geological shifts. Human civilization is too young to have witnessed the full range of geological changes.",
  ["1001071701_171"]="The next eruption could be in a minute, a week, or perhaps in 50,000 years.",
  ["1001071701_172"]="Human civilization, from the Stone Age till now, is barely a blink in geological time.",
  ["1001071701_173"]="But that timescale spans millions of years.",
  ["1001071701_174"]="As I said, geology is all about pressure and time.",
  ["1001071701_175"]="Ming suddenly falls silent, contemplating something.",
  ["1001071701_176"]="Wait, something doesn't fit.",
  ["1001071701_177"]="I... I think I've figured out why Ji Xia came here.",
  ["1001071701_178"]="Quiet, Xin.",
  ["1001071701_179"]="Her words bring us all to a halt.",
  ["1001071701_180"]="If, and it's a big if... If Mount Tianque erupts again after being dormant so long, what will happen?",
  ["1001071701_181"]="If Mount Tianque erupts, it'll vaporize the entire lake.",
  ["1001071701_182"]="We're standing on a lava chamber, with Heavenly Lake right above us.",
  ["1001071701_183"]="Nope, not even he can force it. The \"lid\" still holds the magma pressure for now. As for when Mount Tianque will erupt, it's a matter of pure chance.",
  ["1001071701_184"]="In theory, to set off an eruption, he'd have to break through the rock above the magma chamber, like popping a pressure cooker lid.",
  ["1001071701_185"]="Something feels off. He's got an ace up his sleeve, but I can't quite figure it out.",
  ["1001071701_186"]="Theoretically, it's possible, with enough dynamite on hand.",
  ["1001071701_187"]="But pulling off such a massive blast needs tremendous amount of manpower, explosives, and machinery. No way he pulled that off without raising WeiShi's suspicion.",
  ["1001071701_188"]="Yeah... what's his endgame, exactly?",
  ["1001071701_189"]="The Heavenly Lake atop Mount Tianque... It's actually an ancient volcanic crater remnant.",
  ["1001071701_190"]="But all we see are those bronze monsters. No gear, no explosives.",
  ["1001071701_191"]="...Hmph, this never-ending tunnel is finally coming to an end.",
  ["1001071701_192"]="Could it erupt any second?",
  ["1001071701_193"]="Are we essentially treading on a ticking time bomb that could blow at any moment?",
  ["1001071701_194"]="Geez, you're giving me the creeps!",
  ["1001071701_195"]="Professor Ming, be straight with us! Will this volcano erupt or not?",
  ["1001071701_196"]="Come on! Quit with the grim news, poker face and all!",
  ["1001071701_197"]="Stop the cryptic act. What's the deal?",
  ["1001071701_198"]="Roasted? We'll be vaporized! Not even ashes left!",
  ["1001071701_199"]="If that lake evaporates... Qing taught you about the water cycle, right? Steam becomes clouds, then rain. If Cerulean Water gets up there, the wind will spread it everywhere...",
  ["1001071701_200"]="\"Then what?\" Is that a coconut on your shoulder? Even I get it now! The whole lake's filled with Cerulean Water!",
  ["1001071701_201"]="He had his sights set on Mount Tianque and Heavenly Lake from the get-go! He didn't bother with us because he's playing with the forces of nature.",
  ["1001071701_202"]="Ah, now it clicks... No wonder Ji Xia wasn't bothered about CangLin City or QingYu City.",
  ["1001071701_203"]="That cerulean rain would shower \"immortality\" across the continent... Heck, the whole planet!!",
  ["1001071701_204"]="Break through the rock? Think dynamite could do that?",
  ["1001071701_205"]="That's odd. He's not planning on drilling through the rock himself, right?",
  ["1001071701_206"]="Rain doesn't care about borders.",
  ["1001071701_207"]="The whole world will be infected.",
  ["1001071701_210"]="But there's a hole in his plan.",
  ["1001071701_211"]="Can Ji Xia actually control the eruption?",
  ["1001071701_212"]="Azi furrows her brow.",
  ["1001071701_213"]="Ming shakes her head.",
  ["1001071701_214"]="No way he'd leave it to \"pure chance.\"",
  ["1001071701_216"]="Let's keep going.",
  ["1001071701_217"]="We'll know soon enough.",
  ["1001071701_218"]="Slumbering Depths",
  ["1001071901_100"]="Remember what the Grand General said?",
  ["1001071901_101"]="But this doesn't add up at all. Didn't he open this palace to raise his army and conquer the world?",
  ["1001071901_102"]="Hold on. So, you're saying the emperor offed his own troops?",
  ["1001071901_103"]="The Grand General",
  ["1001071901_63"]="Despite the twists and turns, we eventually shake off the pursuing Grand General and his bronze warriors.",
  ["1001071901_64"]="The group takes a brief break, weariness faintly evident on our faces.",
  ["1001071901_65"]="However, Li Chi remains resolute, his boldness undimmed by fresh wounds.",
  ["1001071901_66"]="Why were you running away? I could've taken him!",
  ["1001071901_68"]="I spotted the cuts on the disassembled bronze soldiers we stumbled upon earlier.",
  ["1001071901_69"]="I recognize the sword marks he left behind.",
  ["1001071901_70"]="He was here. I'm certain.",
  ["1001071901_71"]="Yeah, he ranted something about \"betrayal\"... Seems like he's holding a grudge against his emperor.",
  ["1001071901_72"]="...",
  ["1001071901_73"]="How much longer we gotta run?",
  ["1001071901_74"]="Heh, let's test whose weapon's sharper—his spear or my sword.",
  ["1001071901_75"]="If that pesky general dares to hassle me again, don't hold me back.",
  ["1001071901_76"]="No doubt about that, but if you engage him, how can we be sure an endless horde of bronze soldiers won't overwhelm us?",
  ["1001071901_77"]="Our enemy isn't just one general. It's the whole bronze army.",
  ["1001071901_78"]="I glance back at Zero and approach her quietly, asking her quietly.",
  ["1001071901_79"]="Stop filling your head with those scams, Xin.",
  ["1001071901_80"]="Ji Hong's era dates back thousands of years. If he's tied to some of us, the only possibility would be...",
  ["1001071901_81"]="Not far now. The heat is escalating... We must be close to the core of the Eternal Hall.",
  ["1001071901_82"]="Fine, I'll let you handle it...",
  ["1001071901_83"]="However...",
  ["1001071901_84"]="I do.",
  ["1001071901_85"]="I'm good, been conserving my energy.",
  ["1001071901_86"]="I'm not sure what awaits us at the core of this palace.",
  ["1001071901_87"]="Ann's been quiet since we arrived.",
  ["1001071901_88"]="Azi's loud protests cut through the silence.",
  ["1001071901_89"]="Li Chi replies firmly.",
  ["1001071901_90"]="As for the emperor, he's nowhere in sight. Did he even show up here?",
  ["1001071901_91"]="We've been running forever, but all we bump into are endless bronze warriors and that general obsessed with Li Chi.",
  ["1001071901_92"]="And what's wrong with that guy? He went berserk the moment he saw you.",
  ["1001071901_93"]="Think he's nursing a vendetta against Li Jun's descendant?",
  ["1001071901_94"]="You mentioned he rebelled against Li Jun and captured him. So, if he's connected to us somehow...",
  ["1001071901_95"]="Li Chi sneers.",
  ["1001071901_96"]="Are you okay, Zero?",
  ["1001071901_97"]="Do you think we can handle this, Zero?",
  ["1001071901_98"]="Huh?",
  ["1001071902_1"]="With an icy gleam emanating from Li Chi's blade, the bronze head falls.",
  ["1001071902_11"]="\"The Great Loong.\"",
  ["1001071902_12"]="To shatter the earth's crust.",
  ["1001071902_13"]="Loong?",
  ["1001071902_14"]="Even Mesozoic dinosaurs weren't that huge!",
  ["1001071902_15"]="Not sculptures, but part of some mysterious creature? By the scale, the creature should be as colossal as the city itself.",
  ["1001071902_16"]="That's odd. He's not planning on drilling through the rock himself, right?",
  ["1001071902_17"]="Nine features combined. That's the Loong.",
  ["1001071902_18"]="Rabbit eyes, deer antlers, ox mouth, camel head, clam belly, tiger paws, eagle claws, fish scales, and snake body.",
  ["1001071902_19"]="And remember the scales we saw earlier? What if they're not sculptures but...?",
  ["1001071902_2"]="Li Chi sheathes his blade, refusing to spare a glance at the now headless body reduced to nothingness.",
  ["1001071902_20"]="Of course not... but remember what Li Chi mentioned earlier?",
  ["1001071902_21"]="What if it stirred awake like those bronze soldiers? It would wreak havoc.",
  ["1001071902_22"]="Imagine such a colossal creature: surviving extinction, laying dormant beneath QingYu City, melding with the mountain itself...",
  ["1001071902_23"]="Also, cerulean creatures cease metabolism, leading to the accumulation of metallic cells over time...",
  ["1001071902_24"]="Our planet is 4.54 billion years old. How can we claim to have documented every species that ever existed?",
  ["1001071902_25"]="In theory, to set off an eruption, he'd have to break through the rock above the magma chamber, like popping a pressure cooker lid.",
  ["1001071902_26"]="Something feels off. He's got an ace up his sleeve, but I can't quite figure it out.",
  ["1001071902_27"]="I understand.",
  ["1001071902_28"]="That explains the earthquakes.",
  ["1001071902_29"]="That explains the rising temperature...",
  ["1001071902_3"]="We, the Tianli clan, will never fall to scum like you.",
  ["1001071902_30"]="Hey, our world doesn't have that fairy tale stuff, right?",
  ["1001071902_31"]="Ji Xia is planning to use it...",
  ["1001071902_32"]="Did he say something unusual before he died?",
  ["1001071902_4"]="A soldier who doesn't honor their weapon isn't a true warrior!",
  ["1001071902_5"]="Besides the gibberish? Yeah, he did mention something.",
  ["1001071902_6"]="Just a scratch. Turns out the \"immortal\" isn't so immortal after all.",
  ["1001071902_7"]="If some prehistoric creatures drank the Cerulean Water and became bronze monsters...",
  ["1001071902_8"]="But all we see are those bronze monsters. No gear, no explosives.",
  ["1001071902_9"]="Are you alright?",
  ["1001072001_10"]="In the end, he chooses not to destroy it. If the Emperor ever found out, perhaps he'd forgive him.",
  ["1001072001_100"]="Alone, Ji Xia starts the long climb up the steps toward the imperial palace.",
  ["1001072001_101"]="Before I go, I should take one last look.",
  ["1001072001_102"]="Ji Xia turns away, his eyes following the ridgeline of Mount Tianque as it disappears into the distance.",
  ["1001072001_103"]="An endless eternity with no sense of time.",
  ["1001072001_104"]="They wanted eternal life, so I gave it to them.",
  ["1001072001_105"]="I gave them exactly what they wanted.",
  ["1001072001_106"]="Ji Xia finally smiles, but it is a forced one.",
  ["1001072001_107"]="What exactly did you do?",
  ["1001072001_108"]="Laid to rest? You mean what you did last night?",
  ["1001072001_109"]="As for \"Xia\" itself... Cang Luo once said its time had passed long ago. It was like a corpse that had been dead for ages but still clung to life. But now, it's finally laid to rest.",
  ["1001072001_11"]="His eyes shifts to the jade seal resting at the corner of his desk. In the glow of the setting sun, the inscription on it, \"Heart of the World,\" gleams with a soft, full-moon luster.",
  ["1001072001_110"]="The world doesn't need an emperor anymore. At least, it doesn't need me.",
  ["1001072001_111"]="Call me whatever you want.",
  ["1001072001_112"]="Then how should I address you?",
  ["1001072001_113"]="Ji Xia clenches his fist, as if trying to hold the wind rolling off the river. When he opens his hand, it is empty, just as it has been before.",
  ["1001072001_114"]="But I'm not an emperor anymore. I'm just Ji Xia.",
  ["1001072001_115"]="An emperor owns everything under the heavens, every inch of land and every soul that walks upon it.",
  ["1001072001_116"]="Ji Xia reaches his hand toward the horizon, and the morning light slips through his fingers, finding its way through the spaces in between.",
  ["1001072001_117"]="Didn't I tell you to stop calling me that?",
  ["1001072001_118"]="But what about the empire, Your Majesty?",
  ["1001072001_119"]="Hmm.",
  ["1001072001_12"]="The name would be passed down from generation to generation, like ancestral rites and like history itself.",
  ["1001072001_120"]="So… you're not coming back?",
  ["1001072001_121"]="From now on, I just want to live without a plan.",
  ["1001072001_122"]="I've spent way too much of my life stressing over what comes next.",
  ["1001072001_123"]="Where? Who knows... Just going wherever the road takes me. No plans, no destination.",
  ["1001072001_124"]="Where to this time?",
  ["1001072001_125"]="Yes.",
  ["1001072001_126"]="You're heading off again?",
  ["1001072001_127"]="I'm leaving. I've been tied down in QingYu City for too long. It's time to move on.",
  ["1001072001_128"]="Ji Xia stands up and stretches lazily, shaking off the stiffness in his body.",
  ["1001072001_129"]="I... don't quite understand what you mean.",
  ["1001072001_13"]="One day, when he is old and can no longer bear the weight of this responsibility, he would pass both the name and the duty on to a worthy successor.",
  ["1001072001_130"]="The world doesn't need an emperor anymore.",
  ["1001072001_131"]="You can drop the whole \"Your Majesty\" thing. Hearing it over and over is exhausting.",
  ["1001072001_132"]="Of course not. It's not that serious, Your Majesty...",
  ["1001072001_133"]="Hope you don't take it personally that I ignored you all night.",
  ["1001072001_134"]="Sorry, but I don't have the energy to worry about other people's feelings right now.",
  ["1001072001_135"]="I guess it's just the intuition of a scribe.",
  ["1001072001_136"]="I couldn't see it myself, but I had to be here, just to make sure you were alright.",
  ["1001072001_137"]="But I had a feeling—whatever you left to do last night was big. Like, world-shaking big.",
  ["1001072001_138"]="I… honestly don't know.",
  ["1001072001_139"]="I told you to meet me at dawn. Why'd you come so early?",
  ["1001072001_14"]="His gaze drifts to the crystal-clear waters of Tianchi Lake, and in a sudden rush of inspiration, he discovers his new name.",
  ["1001072001_140"]="And you've been standing all night.",
  ["1001072001_141"]="After hours of silence, Ji Xia finally speaks.",
  ["1001072001_142"]="Your Majesty... you've been sitting here all night.",
  ["1001072001_143"]="Your Majesty?",
  ["1001072001_144"]="Ji Xia sits at the gates of QingYu City, silent.",
  ["1001072001_145"]="Only the great river still crashes against the shore, its waves echoing through the silence.",
  ["1001072001_146"]="On the mountain, once a place of endless revelry with songs playing from dawn to dusk and life drifting between dreams and drunkenness, now lies a ghost town, emptied by the departure of its immortal dwellers.",
  ["1001072001_147"]="At the foot of the mountain, scattered bones litter the wild landscape. For miles around, there is nothing alive in sight.",
  ["1001072001_148"]="However, Mount Tianque is shrouded in an eerie silence.",
  ["1001072001_149"]="The sun rises over QingYu City once again.",
  ["1001072001_15"]="A historian has to be both respectful and cautious. They are nothing more than a thinking hand that records the truth. If even Cang Luo didn't dare to inscribe his own name into history, how could he?",
  ["1001072001_151"]="Beneath Mount Tianque, inside a cavern separated from the mortal realm.",
  ["1001072001_152"]="The structure of this eternal sanctuary, the abode for its immortal inhabitants, mirrors the royal palace atop Mount Tianque.",
  ["1001072001_153"]="The opulent furnishings inside exceed earthly standards tenfold.",
  ["1001072001_154"]="Rivers of mercury flow beside bronze mountains and pearl-studded stars; every earthly element is recreated extravagantly in this realm of wealth and revelry.",
  ["1001072001_155"]="On this day, the eternal sanctuary finally comes to completion.",
  ["1001072001_156"]="Ji Xia walks through the long tunnel, lost in memories of the distant past.",
  ["1001072001_157"]="The sight reminds him of his first unification and the ascension ritual.",
  ["1001072001_158"]="However, at this coronation, his loyal vassals and loving subjects are no longer present.",
  ["1001072001_159"]="Lifting his gaze, he catches sight of countless pairs of bronze eyes gleaming with a cold light amid the radiant illumination.",
  ["1001072001_16"]="Should I use my real name? No... that won't do either.",
  ["1001072001_160"]="Their inhuman faces brim with unnerving delight.",
  ["1001072001_161"]="The foremost Grand General draws his sword, its cerulean crystal blade glinting with a chilling light.",
  ["1001072001_162"]="Emperor! Emperor! Emperor!",
  ["1001072001_163"]="—Emperor! Emperor! Emperor!",
  ["1001072001_164"]="Long live the Emperor! Long live the royal bloodline!",
  ["1001072001_165"]="Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor!",
  ["1001072001_166"]="Amid echoing clashes of bronze, Ji Xia moves steadily toward the heart of the hall.",
  ["1001072001_167"]="Above this place is the Heavenly Lake, and here, right at this spot, rests a slumbering behemoth.",
  ["1001072001_168"]="Despite its dormancy, Ji Xia's heart skips a beat as he approaches it.",
  ["1001072001_169"]="It is a primal fear, the kind any creature feels when facing a predator.",
  ["1001072001_17"]="Cang Luo called himself \"Grand Scribe\" when he recorded history. The scribe, out of respect for his mentor, can't bring himself to use that title.",
  ["1001072001_170"]="The starting point of this creature's dormancy and the reasons behind it remain shrouded in mystery. Yet, at first sight, Ji Xia immediately realizes that this creature is the final piece for his plans.",
  ["1001072001_171"]="The newly appointed scribe created a unique term for this creature as its name—",
  ["1001072001_172"]="The Loong.",
  ["1001072001_173"]="The one and only Loong ever to exist beneath the heavens.",
  ["1001072001_174"]="Just as there is one and only Emperor ruling the realm beneath the heavens.",
  ["1001072001_175"]="Naturally, a profound symbolic link is established between the Loong and the Emperor.",
  ["1001072001_176"]="Therefore, the location where the Loong lies in repose is meant to be at the heart of the eternal sanctuary. Or rather, the entire sanctuary has been structured around the Loong.",
  ["1001072001_177"]="For this very day, the royal family has already constructed an extensive staircase along the sinuous body of the Loong.",
  ["1001072001_178"]="Ascending the stairs, Ji Xia reaches the dragon's head at the peak.",
  ["1001072001_179"]="My loyal kin.",
  ["1001072001_18"]="He sighs and puts the brush down again.",
  ["1001072001_180"]="With our eternal sanctuary, we'll rule in celestial peace for eons to come!",
  ["1001072001_181"]="We're immortal now, free from mortal constraints.",
  ["1001072001_182"]="At his words, the revelry ceases. The royal family falls silent, gazing up at the Emperor atop the dragon's head.",
  ["1001072001_183"]="Long live the Emperor! Long live the royal bloodline!",
  ["1001072001_184"]="Before the assembled audience, Ji Xia faces the lamplight and draws his sword, its blade emitting a frost-edged light.",
  ["1001072001_185"]="The Great Loong remains in its slumber, its true nature unknown to the world. Its scales glowing with a chilly green light hint at its immortality.",
  ["1001072001_186"]="As the royal family readies to cheer, they watch in shock as Ji Xia points his sword at the Loong's head below him.",
  ["1001072001_187"]="In the next moment, the verdant blade plunges straight into the dragon's cranium.",
  ["1001072001_188"]="The beast stirs at last, its millennia-long slumber broken.",
  ["1001072001_189"]="The Loong's furious roars reverberate, causing the mountain to tremble. Amidst the chaos, no one notices Ji Xia's disappearance.",
  ["1001072001_19"]="What tone should I use? Where should I even start?",
  ["1001072001_190"]="As the mechanism operates, the door crafted by Tianli craftsmen seals shut with creaks. Its impenetrable locking mechanism engages, separating the interior from the outside world.",
  ["1001072001_192"]="And so, the eternal sanctuary vanishes from the mortal world.",
  ["1001072001_193"]="Moonlight casts Ji Xia's silhouette onto the rock outside, pale as delicate frost.",
  ["1001072001_194"]="Since you crave for immortality, you shall be forever banned from the earthly realm. This gate shall remain shut for eternity.",
  ["1001072001_195"]="A hidden slot in the gate aligns with the jade seal in Ji Xia's grasp.",
  ["1001072001_196"]="When the Tianli clan constructed the Eternal Hall, it was decreed that only the Emperor's seal could unlock this door.",
  ["1001072001_198"]="Now, this seal's what unlocks the curses behind that gate.",
  ["1001072001_199"]="Ji Xia raises the seal... only to set it down gently.",
  ["1001072001_2"]="\"Keep earthly and heavenly affairs separate.\" (This phrase will be removed after a special visual effect.)",
  ["1001072001_20"]="He picks up a fresh bamboo slip and raises his brush, but his wrist hangs frozen in the air.",
  ["1001072001_201"]="Well, I'll let that kid deal with them...",
  ["1001072001_202"]="Honestly, sometimes I wish I was a heartless monster.",
  ["1001072001_203"]="Well.",
  ["1001072001_204"]="The Loong.",
  ["1001072001_205"]="Forsaken Eternity",
  ["1001072001_21"]="Finally done with his administrative duties, the scribe turns to his true calling.",
  ["1001072001_22"]="The craftsmen have wrapped up their work for the day and are heading home to rest. At the foot of Mount Tianque, for the first time in ages, kitchen fires flare back to life, sending thin plumes of smoke drifting into the evening sky.",
  ["1001072001_23"]="The sun dips below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the shimmering waters of Tianchi Lake.",
  ["1001072001_24"]="Send more people to foster communication between the regions and keep a close watch on things. Right now, the top priority is to restore the abandoned fields at the foot of Mount Tianque.",
  ["1001072001_25"]="But none of them seem powerful enough to take over QingYu City just yet.",
  ["1001072001_26"]="So, the vassals have finally started turning on each other.",
  ["1001072001_27"]="The scribe sits back at his desk and begins flipping through bamboo scrolls filled with intelligence reports.",
  ["1001072001_28"]="Even though he is unsure if this will stop the \"Cerulean Water\" Ji Xia mentioned, he decides to at least try sealing the \"Dragon Pillar\" for now.",
  ["1001072001_29"]="The scribe sets down his brush and rubs his wrist. Through the open window, he sees craftsmen working tirelessly along the shores of Tianchi Lake, using wooden scaffolding and makeshift pulleys to lower a massive, pillar-shaped \"sarcophagus\" toward the center of the water.",
  ["1001072001_3"]="He starts writing the final chapter of Ji Xia's story. The first few words on the bamboo scroll read:",
  ["1001072001_30"]="This place used to be the study of the former Grand Scribe, Cang Luo. His student inherited it just as it was, without changing a thing, not even the furniture.",
  ["1001072001_31"]="Months later, in the Grand Scribe's chamber by Tianchi Lake.",
  ["1001072001_32"]="Ji Xia is stunned for a moment, then bursts out laughing again. By the time his laughter dies down, he is already gone, leaving only the scribe standing by Tianchi Lake, lost in thought.",
  ["1001072001_33"]="Why obsess over the divine when we have the living to worry about?",
  ["1001072001_34"]="Recording their struggles to warn future generations is hard enough. Why bother wasting ink writing about \"immortals\"?",
  ["1001072001_35"]="For years, the people have suffered, living in misery with their lives hanging by a thread.",
  ["1001072001_36"]="No need to worry about it.",
  ["1001072001_37"]="The scribe straightens up and meets Ji Xia's eyes for the first time.",
  ["1001072001_38"]="We ruled over everyone for so long, then just disappeared without a trace. Won't that confuse people down the line?",
  ["1001072001_39"]="Though I have to admit, I'm curious… How will you and your successors write about us \"immortals\" in the history books?",
  ["1001072001_4"]="This time, when he lifts his brush, there is no hesitation.",
  ["1001072001_40"]="Well... I'll leave the hard work to you from here on.",
  ["1001072001_41"]="The scribe respectfully accepts the seal with both hands. The moment it leaves Ji Xia's grasp, he looks relieved as he lets out a long sigh, like a huge weight has been lifted off his shoulders.",
  ["1001072001_42"]="I will take it.",
  ["1001072001_43"]="...",
  ["1001072001_44"]="I don't want anyone fighting over it, using my name to ignite some stupid power struggle, or even worse, causing pointless bloodshed. This way, the chapter \"Xia\" in history can end for good.",
  ["1001072001_45"]="Do me a favor. When I'm gone, just make sure it disappears.",
  ["1001072001_46"]="Destroying it with my own hands would be like wiping away the last memory I have of them. I'm not that cold-hearted.",
  ["1001072001_47"]="They're both gone, and I don't even know if there will ever be a day when I'll see them again.",
  ["1001072001_48"]="But… no. This is the only thing I've left that connects me to Cang Luo and Li Jun.",
  ["1001072001_49"]="I was planning to get rid of it myself, either by tossing it into Tianchi Lake or throwing it into the Great River and letting it disappear.",
  ["1001072001_5"]="They will embody the highest virtue, like water itself, nourishing all yet contending with none.",
  ["1001072001_50"]="The heart of the world...",
  ["1001072001_51"]="This is the Imperial Seal carved by Cang Luo, the original design for Li Jun's regency seal.",
  ["1001072001_52"]="Exactly.",
  ["1001072001_53"]="This is…!",
  ["1001072001_54"]="Ji Xia reaches into his sleeve and pulls out a small seal.",
  ["1001072001_55"]="One more thing.",
  ["1001072001_56"]="He gives the scribe a pat on the shoulder and helps him up.",
  ["1001072001_57"]="Good. That's good.",
  ["1001072001_58"]="This is a huge responsibility, and I'm honored to take it on. As long as I live, I'll give everything to it. And when I'm gone, my successor will carry on the mission. You have my word, my lord!",
  ["1001072001_59"]="Ji Xia's voice is calm and deep, with no trace of command, just an exhaustion he can't quite hide. In that moment, he seems less like an emperor but more like an old man making sure everything is in place before heading out on a long journey. Finally, the scribe lowers his head in a deep bow.",
  ["1001072001_6"]="Like flowing water, fleeting as the current yet eternal as the hidden spring that never runs dry.",
  ["1001072001_60"]="From now on, don't let immortality corrupt this world again.",
  ["1001072001_61"]="Think of it as doing me a favor.",
  ["1001072001_62"]="The two of them lock eyes for a long moment. For a brief second, the scribe feels like he is looking at the Emperor he once knew, a man with deep foresight and unwavering will.",
  ["1001072001_63"]="But since you don't care about immortality, I know I can trust you with this.",
  ["1001072001_64"]="If you had asked me about the secret to immortality even once, I wouldn't have said a word.",
  ["1001072001_65"]="Ji Xia's smile slowly disappears.",
  ["1001072001_66"]="I'm just a scribe. How could I possibly be worthy of such a heavy responsibility?",
  ["1001072001_67"]="Heh, just think of it as my last bit of power as the former emperor.",
  ["1001072001_68"]="So, you're leaving the problem to me?",
  ["1001072001_69"]="If another disaster like the royal family happens again, who's going to clean up the mess?",
  ["1001072001_7"]="The legacy of mere mortals will endure far beyond what emperors and gods could ever imagine.",
  ["1001072001_70"]="Yeah, I know I'm running away, but that doesn't mean I can just ditch everything and walk off.",
  ["1001072001_71"]="Have you forgotten already? Back at the foot of the mountain, you said you weren't an emperor anymore.",
  ["1001072001_72"]="The scribe smiles gently.",
  ["1001072001_73"]="And watch over my people.",
  ["1001072001_74"]="Because when I'm gone, someone needs to watch over Tianchi Lake and keep an eye on that mysterious \"Cerulean Water.\"",
  ["1001072001_75"]="Why are you telling me all this now?",
  ["1001072001_76"]="If it hadn't been for Li Jun's foresight, the Tianli clan would have suffered the same consequences.",
  ["1001072001_77"]="Drinking the Cerulean Water grants immortality. The day Li Jun and I climbed the mountain, I only took a single sip, but then the royal family drank without restraint. Well, you've seen the consequences. They all turned into those inhuman bronze monstrosities.",
  ["1001072001_78"]="Back when Li Jun and I first came here, the lake suddenly became completely transparent, revealing the stone pillar and the \"Cerulean Water.\"",
  ["1001072001_79"]="Or maybe that's the color of the water it releases. It's hard to say. For now, let's just call it \"Cerulean Water.\"",
  ["1001072001_8"]="...Yuanquan.",
  ["1001072001_80"]="Sometimes, the pillar gives the water a strange bluish-green tint.",
  ["1001072001_81"]="About ten feet below the surface, a massive black stone pillar stands.",
  ["1001072001_82"]="Ji Xia points toward Tianchi Lake. The clear water gradually darkens into a deep blue-black as it descends, with its depths unfathomable.",
  ["1001072001_83"]="Alright. I'll tell you everything.",
  ["1001072001_84"]="Hah... if just a few more members of the royal family had thought the way you do, things wouldn't have turned out like this.",
  ["1001072001_85"]="Ji Xia pauses for a moment, then bursts into laughter.",
  ["1001072001_86"]="I'd rather live and die as a mortal, just like my mentor, Cang Luo.",
  ["1001072001_87"]="After seeing what immortality has done to you and your clan, I wouldn't exactly call it a blessing.",
  ["1001072001_88"]="The scribe clasps his hands and bows slightly.",
  ["1001072001_89"]="You've never once asked how I and the royal family gained immortality. Aren't you curious?",
  ["1001072001_9"]="Just as this seal once bound Ji Xia, Cang Luo, and Li Jun together, the name he chooses would one day connect all his successors, decades, centuries, or even millennia from now.",
  ["1001072001_90"]="But there's one thing you've never asked me.",
  ["1001072001_91"]="You're always so nosy, always digging around. Whether it's Tianli or the Ji clan, you always want to know more about everything...",
  ["1001072001_92"]="There's something I've always wondered.",
  ["1001072001_93"]="The scribe stays silent.",
  ["1001072001_94"]="There'll be many emperors after this, they and their ministers will come up with all sorts of names for their empire.",
  ["1001072001_95"]="I wonder who will live here next.",
  ["1001072001_96"]="It really is beautiful up here.",
  ["1001072001_97"]="...",
  ["1001072001_98"]="They make their way through the quiet streets of Qingyu City, passing the towering walls of the imperial palace, until they finally reach the summit, where Tianchi Lake awaits.",
  ["1001072001_99"]="The scribe follows a few paces behind, matching his steps.",
  ["1001072101_100"]="Now, I'm giving it a third try.",
  ["1001072101_101"]="It's like a vortex, pulling everyone in, then starting anew...",
  ["1001072101_102"]="Even the most illustrious monarchs and empires eventually crumble. Many in power boasted of establishing timeless feats or systems, but history always progresses in its own manner...",
  ["1001072101_103"]="Second, letting the ordinary people govern themselves. Yet reigns ascend and descend incessantly over the centuries, both in Qian and in distant realms.",
  ["1001072101_104"]="First, letting the immortals govern the ordinary people, and it failed.",
  ["1001072101_105"]="You know, Yuanquan? So far, I've explored two paths.",
  ["1001072101_106"]="That's true. Haven't I been pursuing my own Land of Peach Blossom as well?",
  ["1001072101_107"]="...",
  ["1001072101_108"]="That's their Land of Peach Blossom.",
  ["1001072101_109"]="You understand this better than anyone. For millennia, haven't the people of Qian been striving for a better world and better lives?",
  ["1001072101_110"]="Every dream, no matter how naive or childish, has its believers. People strive for them.",
  ["1001072101_111"]="The Land of Peach Blossom is a beautiful dream for all living beings.",
  ["1001072101_112"]="Yuanquan shakes his head solemnly.",
  ["1001072101_113"]="Oh? That's quite unexpected. I thought you'd dismiss it as a fairy tale.",
  ["1001072101_114"]="Ji Xia arches his eyebrows in surprise.",
  ["1001072101_115"]="I do.",
  ["1001072101_116"]="So, Yuanquan of WeiShi, do you believe the Land of Peach Blossom truly exists?",
  ["1001072101_117"]="Upon that question, he fell silent. The eternal sanctuary does exist, but it is nothing like the idealistic vision held by ordinary individuals.",
  ["1001072101_118"]="The scholar simply laughed in response to his question, asking, \"Does any eternal sanctuary truly exist in this world?\"",
  ["1001072101_119"]="They shared a few cups of wine. As they indulged, he asked the scholar, \"Does the Land of Peach Blossom truly exist in this world?\"",
  ["1001072101_120"]="Long ago, a scholar had shared a tale with him about a paradise called the Land of Peach Blossom—an eternal sanctuary isolated from the mundane world.",
  ["1001072101_121"]="His life after departing QingYu City has stretched so long that even he struggles to glance back.",
  ["1001072101_122"]="Yeah... what do I truly desire?",
  ["1001072101_123"]="Surprised by Yuanquan's query, Ji Xia bows his head in contemplative silence.",
  ["1001072101_124"]="This isn't a question for me, but for you. What do you genuinely desire at this moment?",
  ["1001072101_125"]="My wish fulfilled...? Interesting. Now, tell me, what is my wish?",
  ["1001072101_126"]="I'd rather say, \"I'll see your wish fulfilled.\"",
  ["1001072101_127"]="Yuanquan shakes his head gently.",
  ["1001072101_128"]="Hahahah... Are you so certain that you'll best me in your generation?",
  ["1001072101_129"]="Rest assured. WeiShi has been attentive to both the match in this courtyard and the affairs in the outside world.",
  ["1001072101_130"]="This game has dragged on way too long. Still, I'm surprised you're in the mood to play amidst this chaos.",
  ["1001072101_131"]="Yes.",
  ["1001072101_132"]="You're limited to just five moves. You're aware of that, right?",
  ["1001072101_133"]="Ji Xia picks up a black piece, gently caressing it for a moment.",
  ["1001072101_134"]="I see. Let's get it started. Your move, please.",
  ["1001072101_135"]="Spare me the sympathy, kid.",
  ["1001072101_136"]="Attachment to your opponent is a no-no in Go.",
  ["1001072101_137"]="Ji Xia merely offers a faint smile.",
  ["1001072101_138"]="Your journey has been harsh.",
  ["1001072101_139"]="If his opponent is not a deity, but merely another human like himself, how tormenting his journey must have been.",
  ["1001072101_140"]="A deep sorrow envelops him as he realizes he need not, and should not, look up to his opponent.",
  ["1001072101_141"]="This soul, long confined within the timeless vessel, resembles a prisoner interrogated by time itself.",
  ["1001072101_142"]="Too young. His opponent appears far younger than he had imagined. Yet, beneath that youthful exterior lies a soul older than his own weary spirit.",
  ["1001072101_143"]="Yet upon finally meeting you, I realize... I was mistaken.",
  ["1001072101_144"]="I revered you and your game against us. I once believed conquering you would be the ultimate quest of my life.",
  ["1001072101_145"]="I've spent the last forty years analyzing our Go matches against you. I envisioned your image and your decisions in every era, throughout your entire life... I thought I knew you thoroughly.",
  ["1001072101_146"]="That's what I always believed... until you took the seat.",
  ["1001072101_147"]="You might know nothing about me, but I know everything about you.",
  ["1001072101_148"]="Yuanquan speaks, only to notice his voice is tinged with emotion.",
  ["1001072101_149"]="Those greenish eyes mirror Yuanquan's aged face, his gaze akin to still water in an ancient well.",
  ["1001072101_150"]="In contrast to himself, appearing weathered like a tree on the brink of falling, his opponent sits upright and handsome like a young pine.",
  ["1001072101_151"]="He has spent most of his life seated at his side of the board, and now, his opponent has finally presented himself across from him.",
  ["1001072101_152"]="Yuanquan opens his eyes.",
  ["1001072101_153"]="Abruptly, the puppet leaves in silence.",
  ["1001072101_154"]="All it takes is settling into his spot by the board, calm and still, and his opponent will eventually take the seat opposite him, pieces in hand, ready to play.",
  ["1001072101_155"]="Seated on one end of the cushion, the elder meditates with closed eyes, as if anticipating the arrival of a guest.",
  ["1001072101_156"]="Resting on the table is a Go board, adorned with black and white pieces strategically placed, indicative of an ongoing game, though the players have left.",
  ["1001072101_157"]="Behind the puppet, a finely crafted table is positioned near the lake.",
  ["1001072101_158"]="The sole companion beside Yuanquan is a tall, humanoid puppet.",
  ["1001072101_159"]="Indications of an impending earthquake intensify. After evacuating the residents, most WeiShi members have left. Despite urgent pleas, however, Yuanquan stays within the society.",
  ["1001072101_160"]="Occasional tremors from deep within the crust feel as if the earth itself pulsates.",
  ["1001072101_161"]="At the peak of Mount Tianque, beside the serene waters of Tianchi Lake.",
  ["1001072101_162"]="A Game of Chess",
  ["1001072101_81"]="Within the hourglass, how many grains remain? Why not unclench the reins, let wind decide my lane? What phantoms chase us through these frantic days? Gilded chains corrode, divinity is but haze...",
  ["1001072101_82"]="Ji Xia abruptly places his cup down and begins to sing.",
  ["1001072101_83"]="...So what?",
  ["1001072101_84"]="Yeah, I can't dismiss that possibility.",
  ["1001072101_85"]="The second white piece promptly follows.",
  ["1001072101_86"]="What if you fail again?",
  ["1001072101_87"]="The second black piece is placed.",
  ["1001072101_88"]="If everyone is granted immortality, they will amass wisdom over time, rectifying the mistakes of their predecessors and learning from them...",
  ["1001072101_89"]="If my plan works out, the Land of Blossom Garden will be within reach.",
  ["1001072101_90"]="Yuanquan sets down a white piece.",
  ["1001072101_91"]="You're discussing the external world, but for now, let's focus on the game before us.",
  ["1001072101_92"]="Savoring his wine, Ji Xia finally places his first black piece.",
  ["1001072101_93"]="Do you think it'll work this time?",
  ["1001072101_94"]="Yuanquan retrieves a jug of wine and two glasses, pouring wine for both himself and Ji Xia.",
  ["1001072101_95"]="...No tear-stained prayer may breach their flight.",
  ["1001072101_96"]="Celestial whims veiled in endless night...",
  ["1001072101_97"]="Yuanquan shakes his head and lets out a sigh.",
  ["1001072101_98"]="Perhaps.",
  ["1001072101_99"]="...You mean granting immortality to all? Letting immortals govern immortals?",
  ["1001072201_243"]="We proceed through another heavy gate, yet the ancient passage extending downward appears endless.",
  ["1001072201_244"]="Apart the rhythmic echo of our footsteps, the surroundings remain eerily silent.",
  ["1001072201_245"]="Recalling Ming's mention of the First Emperor's tombs, I can hardly shake the image of the tomb that purportedly \"cuts through the Yellow Springs and leads to the Underworld.\"",
  ["1001072201_246"]="At this moment, the path beneath my feet feels like a journey towards the end.",
  ["1001072201_247"]="With each step down, the air grows increasingly oppressive.",
  ["1001072201_248"]="My breathing grows labored, with the heat from the earth's core almost were just inches away.",
  ["1001072201_249"]="Eventually, a dim light reveals a massive opening in the wall ahead.",
  ["1001072201_250"]="Wisps of mist, resembling heated steam appearing out of nowhere, hazily veil my view ahead.",
  ["1001072202_1"]="The fall of the Loong seems both instantaneous and yet extended, similar to a slow-motion sequence.",
  ["1001072202_10"]="I wonder where Ji Xia is...?",
  ["1001072202_11"]="We may glimpse the divine dragon's head, yet its tail remains unseen",
  ["1001072202_12"]="We may glimpse the divine dragon's head, yet its tail remains unseen",
  ["1001072202_2"]="The gargantuan creature, which escaped the catastrophe that befell its kin eons ago, is now ultimately caught in the grasp of belated demise.",
  ["1001072202_3"]="The radiance in its colossal eyes wanes.",
  ["1001072202_4"]="The Loong's lengthy bronze body plunges into the deepest recesses of the lava chamber, its massive head swaying one final time before disappearing into the darkness beneath the plaza.",
  ["1001072202_5"]="As its form dissipates, a faint cerulean glimmer crosses my vision.",
  ["1001072202_6"]="It is the reflection of the tiny green-hued sword lodged atop the Loong's head.",
  ["1001072202_7"]="Without that sword, I wouldn't have delivered a fatal blow at the crucial moment so easily.",
  ["1001072202_8"]="Did the person, who left behind that sword, intend to awaken or eliminate the Loong?",
  ["1001072202_9"]="Unfortunately, the person who can provide an answer is still nowhere to be found.",
  ["1001072301_159"]="Now, it is the moment to regale his old friends with the marvelous sights and tales he has encountered along his journey.",
  ["1001072301_160"]="After wandering for years, he has finally, with great effort, reunited with his cherished companions of yore.",
  ["1001072301_161"]="Despite traversing this world for millennia, upon his return, he still resembles a child with an unsteady gait.",
  ["1001072301_162"]="In deep slumber, he finds eternal rest.",
  ["1001072301_163"]="Ji Xia props up his parched chin with his weathered arm.",
  ["1001072301_164"]="Yet upon lifting his head, he sees only a peacefully slumbering visage.",
  ["1001072301_165"]="In his trance, Yuanquan catches a faint response from across the board.",
  ["1001072301_166"]="...",
  ["1001072301_167"]="Rest now. May your dreams... stay peaceful.",
  ["1001072301_168"]="Chieftain...",
  ["1001072301_169"]="Yuanquan bows his head, clenching his fists, struggling to speak.",
  ["1001072301_170"]="Even for them, how could it be any different?",
  ["1001072301_174"]="Aged, I linger where the wild winds roam, A stubborn bird who shuns the sweet home.&Life burns brief as sparks in midnight's hold, Worlds rewrite tales in lightning-storms of gold.&Years like sand through calloused palms now fall, Chasing phantom suns that never call.",
  ["1001072301_175"]="Consumed by regret on his deathbed, he instructed his successors to rectify his mistake, if possible.",
  ["1001072301_176"]="He once used that blade to wound the soul of someone he deeply respected.",
  ["1001072301_177"]="\"A scribe's brush can cut like a blade, and words can wound a person's soul.\" Those are his teachings.",
  ["1001072301_178"]="...",
  ["1001072301_179"]="Because \"Cang\" is my family name, Master.",
  ["1001072301_180"]="...",
  ["1001072301_181"]="Why have you fixated on this game and your opponent all these years? \"Curiosity\" seems flimsy.",
  ["1001072301_182"]="Well, it's my turn now. Before I pass everything to you, I need an answer.",
  ["1001072301_183"]="Time halts in that moment. All scenes recede like the ebbing tide, reverting back to that study room from decades past.",
  ["1001072301_184"]="Then, a warm tear drops onto the board.",
  ["1001072301_185"]="Silence envelops the surroundings.",
  ["1001072301_186"]="Until redemptive snow blankets everything in boundless white.",
  ["1001072301_187"]="Yuanquan patiently awaits the black piece that will never come.",
  ["1001072301_188"]="...",
  ["1001072301_189"]="...",
  ["1001072301_190"]="...",
  ["1001072301_191"]="...",
  ["1001072301_192"]="...",
  ["1001072301_193"]="Still got one move... Let me think... just a little longer...",
  ["1001072301_194"]="I've never lost in my life.",
  ["1001072301_195"]="Heh, you cheeky pup...",
  ["1001072301_196"]="...",
  ["1001072301_197"]="Age etches wrinkles across his face.",
  ["1001072301_198"]="You've lost, Your Majesty.",
  ["1001072301_199"]="Frost graces his dark hair.",
  ["1001072301_200"]="Ah... I see... it's you.",
  ["1001072301_201"]="It was... you...",
  ["1001072301_202"]="...",
  ["1001072301_203"]="A ripple emerges in Ji Xia's composed eyes.",
  ["1001072301_204"]="Your Majesty, do you recall the first person you ever played this game with?",
  ["1001072301_205"]="...",
  ["1001072301_206"]="As you wish.",
  ["1001072301_207"]="A black piece is swiftly placed.",
  ["1001072301_208"]="Today... we play till I'm satisfied.",
  ["1001072301_209"]="You may have vanquished my Loong, but I'm not lost yet.",
  ["1001072301_210"]="Stay by my side. Let's finish this game.",
  ["1001072301_211"]="Time erodes his voice.",
  ["1001072301_212"]="Good... that's good...",
  ["1001072301_213"]="...",
  ["1001072301_214"]="I see...",
  ["1001072301_215"]="He stoops, visibly starting to wither.",
  ["1001072301_216"]="His time, which has stagnated for five millennia, begins to flow once more in that instant.",
  ["1001072301_217"]="The sound of something intangible fracturing reverberates.",
  ["1001072301_218"]="His words cut like a sharp axe, instantly severing the foundation that has supported Ji Xia all this time.",
  ["1001072301_219"]="Your children no longer need you, Your Majesty.",
  ["1001072301_220"]="This land no longer needs the Loong, the immortals, or the Emperor.",
  ["1001072301_221"]="Your children will succeed where you failed.",
  ["1001072301_222"]="You no longer need to concern yourself with that.",
  ["1001072301_223"]="Yuanquan interjects Ji Xia's incoherent words with an almost unyielding tone.",
  ["1001072301_224"]="Are my children well-fed? Clothed? Sheltered...?",
  ["1001072301_225"]="How could there not be... regrets?",
  ["1001072301_226"]="I have too many things left undone...",
  ["1001072301_227"]="Heh, you really know how to strike a nerve, kid.",
  ["1001072301_228"]="...",
  ["1001072301_229"]="Any regrets, perhaps?",
  ["1001072301_230"]="Well, I believe you are already privy to what I know, so I won't dwell on it. No need to sound like a stubborn old ghost haunting the living.",
  ["1001072301_231"]="Do you have any final instructions?",
  ["1001072301_232"]="All that he believed lost forever has transmuted into snow, gently settling back onto his shoulders, as if they had never departed.",
  ["1001072301_233"]="Life is a grand cycle in itself.",
  ["1001072301_234"]="But I forgot... rivers turn to clouds, and rain falls to earth...",
  ["1001072301_235"]="With bare hands, he cast pebbles into the river, futile in his efforts to erect a dam to impede the flow.",
  ["1001072301_236"]="Such an endeavor would require a gargantuan dam.",
  ["1001072301_237"]="Could he preserve what he holds dear by constructing a dam?",
  ["1001072301_238"]="Thus, he stood alone on the riverbank, observing the river flowing towards the sea, never to return.",
  ["1001072301_239"]="Those intangible elements, despite his utmost efforts, persisted in slipping away from his side.",
  ["1001072301_240"]="He was once akin to a wanderer strolling along a river, striving to reach out and grasp onto something, yet the flowing water always eluded his grasp.",
  ["1001072301_241"]="The latter half of his sentence remains unfinished.",
  ["1001072301_242"]="Time, so fragile yet unpredictable. I used to believe it flowed like a river...",
  ["1001072301_243"]="We shall meet again in due time.",
  ["1001072301_244"]="Don't you wish to see that person again?",
  ["1001072301_245"]="If it involves the prophesied one, you will be sheltered.",
  ["1001072301_246"]="A nostalgic expression crosses Ji Xia's face.",
  ["1001072301_247"]="Ah, I see... the prophesied one...",
  ["1001072301_248"]="Then forgive me for declining your request. We won't turn a blind eye to Eme-an and their Head Librarian.",
  ["1001072301_249"]="Consider this my personal plea. Steer clear of them... Some matters are best left untouched.",
  ["1001072301_250"]="I've looked into the Nemesis members. Most of them are small-time opportunists and won't pose a threat. However, some are deeply entrenched, and even I can't fully grasp their true essence. Be cautious not to get entangled with them...",
  ["1001072301_251"]="I will.",
  ["1001072301_252"]="Take care of the Tianli clan.",
  ["1001072301_253"]="No need to fret. Zhantan is already on it.",
  ["1001072301_254"]="I've managed to drive some away, but with winter approaching, they won't cease coveting the granary. Remember, smoke them out and destroy their nests.",
  ["1001072301_255"]="The commotion has drawn rats from the north.",
  ["1001072301_256"]="Ji Xia lets out a breath.",
  ["1001072301_257"]="Descending in silence.",
  ["1001072301_258"]="The snow begins to fall...",
  ["1001072301_259"]="...",
  ["1001072301_260"]="Now, you can liberate yourself from your hesitation.",
  ["1001072301_261"]="Now, you can break free from your hesitation.",
  ["1001072301_262"]="I knew it was impossible, yet I was still obsessed. Perhaps I've lived far too long... ebbed away by my hesitation in the end.",
  ["1001072301_263"]="Do I wish to construct the Land of Peach Blossom or raze it?",
  ["1001072301_264"]="Do I wish to awaken that Loong or kill it?",
  ["1001072301_265"]="You saw me through when you asked what I truly desired, didn't you?",
  ["1001072301_266"]="Yeah, you're right. I'm just... a wanderer. Hesitant. Lost.",
  ["1001072301_267"]="Ji Xia grins, a smile that transcends the veil of time, carrying a long-forgotten tranquility and sincerity.",
  ["1001072301_268"]="If you had truly made your decision, we wouldn't be here at all.",
  ["1001072301_269"]="Yet now, nearing the end of my life, this game doesn't seem quite as enigmatic.",
  ["1001072301_270"]="When I was young, this game with you felt profound, almost unfathomable.",
  ["1001072301_271"]="The game of Go reflects its players. Watch someone play, and you'll glimpse their soul.",
  ["1001072301_272"]="I've loved the game of Go since I was a child.",
  ["1001072301_273"]="Yuanquan, however, pauses.",
  ["1001072301_274"]="The decisive move was made centuries ago.",
  ["1001072301_275"]="But when it arrives, you've matured much sooner than I anticipated.",
  ["1001072301_276"]="...I thought I'd waited an eternity for this moment.",
  ["1001072301_277"]="Ji Xia tilts his head and releases a long sigh.",
  ["1001072301_278"]="On the Go board, the black \"Loong\" has been vanquished, the game's outcome apparent.",
  ["1001072301_279"]="Congratulations... your wish is fulfilled now.",
  ["1001072301_280"]="Another white piece is laid, creating a fresh ripple.",
  ["1001072301_281"]="And then.",
  ["1001072301_282"]="...",
  ["1001072301_283"]="Silence envelops the surroundings at that moment, the lake's surface mirroring a serene expanse of water.",
  ["1001072301_284"]="Then, in a heartbeat, the earth calms, and the dragon submerges. All the anomalous phenomena descend into the azure abyss, as if the passage of millennia finally settles into the lake.",
  ["1001072301_285"]="At his utterance, the earth convulses abruptly, and the lake water churns, casting up turbid waves into the air.",
  ["1001072301_286"]="Of course I'm proud! Kids need to rebel! How else do they evolve? If they simply obey their fathers, how would they ever overthrow them?",
  ["1001072301_287"]="Ji Xia slaps down a black piece, its sound resonating like struck metal.",
  ["1001072301_288"]="Your tone doesn't sound angry, but rather almost proud.",
  ["1001072301_289"]="Yuanquan chuckles softly.",
  ["1001072301_290"]="And if you give them a serious order, they'd merely refuse because they \"couldn't bring themselves to do it.\"",
  ["1001072301_291"]="Those scribes loved preaching \"The Emperor's words are final.\" But the truth? They simply wished to caution me not to joke about anything, as they'd faithfully record it in history.",
  ["1001072301_292"]="Ji Xia smirks, his tone teasing.",
  ["1001072301_293"]="He couldn't simply destroy the seal crafted by Master Cang Luo, the legacy... from you.",
  ["1001072301_294"]="Oh? What couldn't he bring himself to do?",
  ["1001072301_295"]="But he couldn't bring himself to do it.",
  ["1001072301_297"]="That's true. If he had destroyed that seal... I'd never have had the chance to sit here, enjoying a game with you and slay your \"Loong\" on the board.",
  ["1001072301_298"]="Back then, I told the first Yuanquan to destroy the seal with the \"Heart of the World.\" If he had obeyed... this game would have ended long ago.",
  ["1001072301_299"]="Gazing at the white piece blocking his black \"Loong\" on the Go board, Ji Xia bursts into laughter, unbound by constraints.",
  ["1001072301_300"]="Agreed. Let the past remain buried in the past.",
  ["1001072301_301"]="A white piece is set on the board.",
  ["1001072301_302"]="A crypt for corpses that should've rotted ages ago, and a sleeping monster that'll only wreck everything if stirred.",
  ["1001072301_303"]="The eternal sanctuary? Just a fancy graveyard.",
  ["1001072301_304"]="Ji Xia sneers.",
  ["1001072301_305"]="Seems they've discovered the eternal sanctuary.",
  ["1001072301_306"]="However, the two players remain focused on their game.",
  ["1001072301_307"]="Suddenly, the ground trembles once more. In an instant, the lake's surface gleams with a golden hue, the faint echo of a dragon's roar resonating from its depths.",
  ["1001072301_308"]="Naturally.",
  ["1001072301_309"]="Ji Xia nods in response.",
  ["1001072301_310"]="Are you fully prepared?",
  ["1001072301_311"]="Yuanquan fixes his gaze on Ji Xia.",
  ["1001072301_312"]="However, this time, the white piece does not follow suit.",
  ["1001072301_313"]="After a moment's contemplation, Ji Xia places another black piece.",
  ["1001072301_314"]="The board is illuminated by an eerie light, while the lake mirrors the silhouettes of the two players.",
  ["1001072301_315"]="The greenish haze gradually disperses before the Go board.",
  ["1001072301_316"]="The sun shines brightly.",
  ["1001072301_317"]="The Demise",
  ["1001072401_1"]="After the Loong's exceptionally large body falls, the hot air that has been emanating from underneath dissipates soon after its death.",
  ["1001072401_10"]="Noticing Li Chi and Ming looking at me, I speak with a hint of awkwardness.",
  ["1001072401_100"]="But then again, you've been fighting for so long. Why not take a breather in Qian and enjoy our hospitality for a few more days, let us fulfill our duty as good hosts?",
  ["1001072401_101"]="CangLin City is finally having its long-awaited Harvest Festival, and our young members who are close to you will be attending it.",
  ["1001072401_102"]="If you have the time, feel free to join them in celebrating the arrival of autumn.",
  ["1001072401_105"]="Unfortunately, no.",
  ["1001072401_106"]="I have to head to Fengbei City to report the Cerulean Water incident to the current leader of Qian.",
  ["1001072401_107"]="Before you leave for the Harvest Festival, our little puppetmaster... has prepared another gift for you.",
  ["1001072401_108"]="...",
  ["1001072401_109"]="Since passing me the documents, Yuli has been standing by, watching at me in silence.",
  ["1001072401_110"]="Her gaze fixed on the shoulder lines and cuffs of Zero's and my attire, her fingers tracing the thread in her palm as if measuring something.",
  ["1001072401_111"]="She watches intently until our eyes meet, then gives a slight nod.",
  ["1001072401_113"]="Kindness deserves gratitude in return.",
  ["1001072401_114"]="I'm just doing what little I can. Comparing to you Head Librarian, It's nothing to what you've done for this land.",
  ["1001072401_115"]="Wait a moment...",
  ["1001072401_117"]="Surprisingly, it is not Yuli who responds, but the massive puppet accompanying her.",
  ["1001072401_118"]="Accompanied by the soft clicks of her joints as she moves, the puppet speaks in a voice as clear and gentle as a human would, with hardly any stiffness.",
  ["1001072401_119"]="Even Zero, often composed as a still as an ancient well, widens her eyes in surprise.",
  ["1001072401_12"]="Come on... Haven't you realized you just took down a Loong?",
  ["1001072401_120"]="You're scaring everyone, Sue.",
  ["1001072401_121"]="I'm just giving you a nudge. If you keep dawdling like this, the Head Librarian will leave, and all your efforts with the needles and threads will go to waste.",
  ["1001072401_122"]="Plus, a talking puppet shouldn't be too surprising for the Head Librarian, right?",
  ["1001072401_124"]="Are there really a bird like that? Hmm, I'm already imagining it chirping \"good morning\" with a little head tilt... sounds adorable.",
  ["1001072401_125"]="...",
  ["1001072401_126"]="I apologize for Sue's embarrassing comments.",
  ["1001072401_127"]="Anyhow, you may think of Sue as a wooden robot imitating human speech and behavior. She's just parroting what she's been taught.",
  ["1001072401_128"]="Now, please come with me.",
  ["1001072401_129"]="Sue and I have... some clothes ready for the two of you.",
  ["1001072401_13"]="Everyone in this land claims to be its descendants.",
  ["1001072401_130"]="Miss Yuli, this gift is perhaps too much...",
  ["1001072401_131"]="Don't worry, it'll be finished soon.",
  ["1001072401_132"]="Please keep your arms straight and keep still in that pose.",
  ["1001072401_133"]="...",
  ["1001072401_134"]="Perhaps Zero never expected that Yuli's \"gift\" would involve sewing a garment for her on the spot.",
  ["1001072401_135"]="Yuli swiftly works with various fabrics, needles, and threads, creating the garment with deft and precise movements.",
  ["1001072401_136"]="A faint buzz fills the room as needles, threads, and puppets of various sizes come together under Yuli's skillful hands.",
  ["1001072401_137"]="Cutting, ironing, sewing... As the puppets dance around the sewing machine, the fabrics gradually take shape, forming a garment of various colors.",
  ["1001072401_138"]="\"A needle, thread, and a little imagination can change everything.\" This saying accurately depicts the scene that is currently unfolding before us.",
  ["1001072401_14"]="You've brought an end to the most ancient and revered legend in Qian.",
  ["1001072401_140"]="Yes, whenever a new puppet learns to walk, I personally hand-sew clothes for these children.",
  ["1001072401_141"]="But this is my first time making clothes for someone other than a puppet.",
  ["1001072401_142"]="However, Zero... You do have a unique feeling about you.",
  ["1001072401_143"]="When we first met, you seemed as carefully crafted as a puppet. But as my scissors sliced through silks with that \"click\" sound, your eyes showed a hint of resistance.",
  ["1001072401_144"]="Please don't mind... I'm just not used to this yet.",
  ["1001072401_145"]="But I've never had this issue when making outfits for my puppets...",
  ["1001072401_146"]="It's only natural.",
  ["1001072401_147"]="Humans aren't like lifeless puppets. They experience complex emotions, where even tiny sounds and movements can trigger subtle reactions.",
  ["1001072401_148"]="To you, that \"click\" sound is just the noise of cutting silk.",
  ["1001072401_149"]="But for others, it might bring up unsettling memories, like the swish of a blade through the air or something else.",
  ["1001072401_150"]="...",
  ["1001072401_151"]="I see.",
  ["1001072401_152"]="I thought sewing was similar to puppetry: pull the strings, and everything falls into place. I didn't realize there were deeper layers to it... Looks like I still have more to learn.",
  ["1001072401_153"]="Yuli nods, retrieving a notebook and jotting down a pensive note.",
  ["1001072401_154"]="Oh, my pencil is flying away... Wait, whoa...!",
  ["1001072401_155"]="Before she can make much progress, the pencil in her hand becomes entangled with the delicate strings.",
  ["1001072401_156"]="Gradually, the threads in the room become entangled, leading to a chain reaction of chaos.",
  ["1001072401_157"]="In the blink of an eye, the room lies in disarray.",
  ["1001072401_158"]="...",
  ["1001072401_159"]="In contrast to her composed demeanor in battle, The Puppetmaster reveals an unexpected side of clumsiness.",
  ["1001072401_16"]="You've done a fantastic job, Head Librarian.",
  ["1001072401_160"]="However, the puppet beside her remains as capricious as ever, with a permanent smirk etched upon its wooden-carved face.",
  ["1001072401_161"]="This is so... embarrassing, dear Head Librarian.",
  ["1001072401_163"]="Like they say, jade that is not carved cannot become useful... Besides, I'm just a puppet. How can I step in without my master's command?",
  ["1001072401_164"]="Oh, you're quite observant, just like Yuanquan mentioned.",
  ["1001072401_165"]="Actually, Yuli lost almost all her memories... Her past, joys, sorrows—all wiped clean in an accident.",
  ["1001072401_166"]="So, she had to start over and relearn everything like a child.",
  ["1001072401_168"]="It was a mix of luck and misfortune. Yuli forgot everything except that she's a puppetmaster.",
  ["1001072401_169"]="That single thread of her identity is all she has left now.",
  ["1001072401_17"]="This is exactly the kind of task our generation was meant for.",
  ["1001072401_170"]="With that focus, skills that would take most people decades to master became second nature in her hands.",
  ["1001072401_171"]="But spending so much time with her puppets made her somewhat detached from the outside world, leading her to miss out on certain social graces and customs.",
  ["1001072401_172"]="You might need to be patient with her in many ways.",
  ["1001072401_173"]="Just as we chat, the threads in the room come to a halt.",
  ["1001072401_174"]="Alright, Zero's outfit is nearly done. Just needs some final touches like trimming and ironing.",
  ["1001072401_175"]="Please stay put, Head Librarian. I'll measure you in a moment.",
  ["1001072401_176"]="Oh, speaking of patience.",
  ["1001072401_177"]="Overwhelmed by an array of needles and threads and under the collective gaze of all the puppets in the room, I feel a chill running down my spine.",
  ["1001072401_179"]="No need to worry, I've experience it.",
  ["1001072401_18"]="We are tasked with safeguarding the legends and myths within the dark cave, preventing them from causing harm so that humanity can move forward on its path.",
  ["1001072401_180"]="Miss Yuli has nimble hands... Besides a bit of itching, it's not uncomfortable at all.",
  ["1001072401_182"]="At the moment I feel cornered by the puppets, the communicator on my waist buzzes.",
  ["1001072401_183"]="Hey, aren't we supposed to leave in the morning? The sun's already high up! Where are you now?",
  ["1001072401_185"]="Huh? What are you talking about...?",
  ["1001072401_186"]="Anyway, hurry up, or I'll devour all the skewers Azi bought.",
  ["1001072401_187"]="Let's call it a day, Yuli.",
  ["1001072401_188"]="Our dear Head Librarian has an appointment. It wouldn't be polite to delay our benefactor anymore.",
  ["1001072401_189"]="Yes, I'll tidy up and escort you down the mountain right away.",
  ["1001072401_19"]="If that Loong is one of those hidden truths, then let it rest in peace.",
  ["1001072401_190"]="Looks like I can't make you a garment this time... but if there's another chance, what would you like as a gift?",
  ["1001072401_192"]="I see. I'll carefully consider of another gift that truly convey my sentiments.",
  ["1001072401_193"]="Attending the Harvest Festival? Well... there's still some time before it starts. Why not stay on the mountain a bit longer?",
  ["1001072401_194"]="Yeah, Tianli clan owes us a feast. If Qing hadn't prodded us down the mountain, I'd be eating right now!",
  ["1001072401_195"]="Totally agree. I haven't gathered all the exclusive materials for my visit to the Tianli ancestral home yet. If I let this opportunity slip away, who knows when I'll get to visit again?",
  ["1001072401_196"]="It was Qing who gave the orders. No point complaining to me, you know?",
  ["1001072401_197"]="Besides... I'd rather leave, to be honest.",
  ["1001072401_198"]="If Master Yuanquan hadn't asked me to watch over the Tianli ancestral home, I'd be sound asleep at home right now.",
  ["1001072401_199"]="Ming stows her lamp staff away and nods in my direction.",
  ["1001072401_2"]="Ming glances down towards the dark abyss below.",
  ["1001072401_200"]="How about... spending a few more days in QingYu City with me, Head Librarian?",
  ["1001072401_201"]="Since you have some free time, a stroll in the mountains would do you good. The beginning of fall is a wonderful time to relax in QingYu City.",
  ["1001072401_202"]="Plus, you and that patriarch seem to be getting along well. If there are any communication issues during the renovation... you could help mediate.",
  ["1001072401_204"]="What about you, little Yuli? Do you have any plans? If you're heading the same way, we can go down the mountain together.",
  ["1001072401_205"]="There is no need. After I see the Head Librarian off, I'll take my leave.",
  ["1001072401_206"]="There are changes in my strings. Sue and I... have other businesses to attend to.",
  ["1001072401_207"]="Yeah, other businesses... Seriously, haven't we sorted out the Cerulean Water incident? Why is everyone still wrapped up in their tasks?",
  ["1001072401_208"]="It's odd how Qing is so eager to have us back. Could there be another trouble in CangLin City, I wonder?",
  ["1001072401_209"]="It's probably because of the Harvest Festival.",
  ["1001072401_210"]="Despite the twists and turns this year, the crisis has passed, and the CangLin municipal government aims to assist everyone in returning to their normal routines.",
  ["1001072401_211"]="Everybody is looking forward to the Harvest Festival, so a sense of ceremony is essential.",
  ["1001072401_212"]="You all go ahead and attend to your tasks. The Head Librarian and I will meet at Tianchi Lake in three days and head down the mountain together.",
  ["1001072401_214"]="It's over.",
  ["1001072401_215"]="We did it.",
  ["1001072401_216"]="What's wrong?",
  ["1001072401_217"]="Is there something on my face?",
  ["1001072401_218"]="This is a good thing, right?",
  ["1001072401_219"]="Is this a bad thing?",
  ["1001072401_220"]="So the Loong is one of those things...",
  ["1001072401_221"]="CangLin City...",
  ["1001072401_222"]="How are things going in CangLin City?",
  ["1001072401_223"]="What about Ji Xia?",
  ["1001072401_226"]="But I thought he was immortal?",
  ["1001072401_227"]="I don't know much about him yet.",
  ["1001072401_228"]="What was he really seeking...?",
  ["1001072401_229"]="What do you mean?",
  ["1001072401_231"]="Let's start by rebuilding the Tower of Babel.",
  ["1001072401_232"]="I need to head back to Obed to check things out.",
  ["1001072401_233"]="Will you come too, Master Yuanquan?",
  ["1001072401_235"]="Thank you for your invitation.",
  ["1001072401_236"]="Sure, we'll be there.",
  ["1001072401_237"]="To be honest, I didn't expect another gift.",
  ["1001072401_238"]="That's really generous of you.",
  ["1001072401_24"]="I let out a sigh, but Ming shakes her head.",
  ["1001072401_241"]="The puppet...",
  ["1001072401_242"]="The puppet is talking?!",
  ["1001072401_245"]="Yeah, I've seen a talking bird already...",
  ["1001072401_246"]="Actually, a talking puppet is quite surprising.",
  ["1001072401_247"]="You're really skilled with your movements.",
  ["1001072401_248"]="Do you often make clothes?",
  ["1001072401_249"]="Aren't you going to help her?",
  ["1001072401_25"]="Every ancient dynasty in Qian has its own stories about Loong. The creature we slew is probably just one aspect of it.",
  ["1001072401_250"]="Is she not used to things outside of puppetry?",
  ["1001072401_251"]="If that's the case... how did she become a puppetmaster?",
  ["1001072401_253"]="Maybe... next time?",
  ["1001072401_254"]="This is feeling a bit too much.",
  ["1001072401_255"]="That's not the point!",
  ["1001072401_256"]="Please, someone get me out...",
  ["1001072401_257"]="Ah, what a relief.",
  ["1001072401_259"]="The fact that you're willing to give me a gift is what really matters.",
  ["1001072401_26"]="Also, the Loong in our beliefs is a creation of our spirits. So, the \"Loong\" that lives in the hearts of all the people of Qian will continue in their souls.",
  ["1001072401_260"]="Anything that conveys your feelings would be perfect.",
  ["1001072401_261"]="Sure, leave it to me.",
  ["1001072401_262"]="This is already giving me a headache...",
  ["1001072401_263"]="QingYu City",
  ["1001072401_264"]="Echoes Settled",
  ["1001072401_265"]="As for the mausoleum... I've sent our members to take care of it. I trust that they'll handle the situation properly.",
  ["1001072401_27"]="A sudden warmth emanates from my palm.",
  ["1001072401_28"]="Looking down, I notice the faint glow of the tiny Beacon.",
  ["1001072401_29"]="A mix of familiar yet unfamiliar feelings washes over me.",
  ["1001072401_3"]="Looks like the body has filled in the gaps in the magma chamber.",
  ["1001072401_30"]="There you are.",
  ["1001072401_31"]="Have you thought it over? Is it the right time now?",
  ["1001072401_32"]="Words flow naturally from my lips.",
  ["1001072401_34"]="Understood. As you wish.",
  ["1001072401_35"]="Time, frozen in its tracks, will begin flowing again...",
  ["1001072401_36"]="To QingYu City.",
  ["1001072401_37"]="As the situation settles, evacuated citizens begin to return, and the foot of Mount Tianque becomes bustling with activity.",
  ["1001072401_38"]="The foliage on the mountains has turned a golden hue in line with the season. In the brisk autumn wind, the Grandeur River emits a faint chill.",
  ["1001072401_39"]="We are thrilled to present a special program: a press conference brought to you by the Bureau of Culture & Tourism!",
  ["1001072401_4"]="We don't have to worry about the Tianchi Lake evaporating right now.",
  ["1001072401_40"]="Dear citizens, we express our heartfelt appreciation for your unwavering dedication during this challenging period.",
  ["1001072401_41"]="We are immensely grateful for your cooperation. We have pinpointed the root cause of the recent events and have taken necessary appropriate measures.",
  ["1001072401_42"]="Recent reports have revealed that pollution in the Grandeur River stems from Tianchi Lake, with contamination caused by an unprecedented surge of a rare strain of algae.",
  ["1001072401_43"]="This particular variant of algae has the ability to rapidly reproduce and spread its spores through the air, leading to the disruptive \"Cerulean Fog.\"",
  ["1001072401_44"]="Presently, we are conducting thorough investigations into the origins of the algae outbreak. Our esteemed expert, Ming Xiaomin, has suggested that the presence of radioactive minerals deep within Tianchi Lake may have triggered genetic mutations in the algae, significantly enhancing its reproductive capabilities.",
  ["1001072401_45"]="As of now, the source of contamination has been contained. We have successfully decontaminated Tianchi Lake and introduced a significant amount of algal growth inhibitors into the Grandeur River. Any remaining algae is expected to be eradicated imminently.",
  ["1001072401_46"]="Medical records from hospitals indicate a positive trend in the recovery of individuals affected by respiratory symptoms caused by the spores. Ming Xiaomin has confirmed that following the removal of the contamination source, all patients can anticipate swift recovery through antibiotic treatments.",
  ["1001072401_47"]="Furthermore, in terms of the resumption of industrial activities, the Bureau of Roads & Travel and the Bureau of Employment & Social Support have devised the following strategies...",
  ["1001072401_48"]="...With that, we conclude this press conference. Once again, we extend our deepest gratitude to every citizen of QingYu City for your patience and cooperation, as well as to all the courageous individuals who worked tirelessly on the front lines during this crisis. We are confident that normalcy will soon be restored in our daily lives.",
  ["1001072401_49"]="Thank you for all your hard work, Head Librarian.",
  ["1001072401_5"]="...",
  ["1001072401_50"]="I can hardly express how grateful I am.",
  ["1001072401_51"]="After the Loong died, the Beacon at Tianchi Lake deactivated, and the Cerulean Water is no longer being produced.",
  ["1001072401_52"]="We're not exactly sure how these anomalies are connected, but since Beacons are far beyond human understanding, anything can happen to them.",
  ["1001072401_53"]="One thing we do know for sure is that if you hadn't slain that Loong, the chaos caused by the Cerulean Water would have lasted for a long time.",
  ["1001072401_55"]="Qing sent a message mentioning that life in CangLin City has returned to normal, and most citizens are unaware of the city being removed from the flow of time.",
  ["1001072401_56"]="The very few who have sensed the anomaly have been identified as gifted individuals and have piqued our special interest. They might join our ranks in the future.",
  ["1001072401_57"]="...",
  ["1001072401_58"]="He passed away before you returned.",
  ["1001072401_6"]="Everyone stays silent. Although we have just resolved the source of a major crisis, nobody exhibits any joy over this victory.",
  ["1001072401_60"]="Ji Xia... well, he only took a sip of the Cerulean Water.",
  ["1001072401_61"]="He didn't gain complete immortality at all.",
  ["1001072401_62"]="The details about that emperor aren't particularly important for you right now.",
  ["1001072401_63"]="But one day, you will understand him better than anyone else does.",
  ["1001072401_64"]="Indeed. What was that emperor truly seeking?",
  ["1001072401_65"]="With your keen intuition, you'll see things as they truly are and understand his true motives.",
  ["1001072401_66"]="His past is a lengthy and intricate history.",
  ["1001072401_67"]="The Wencheng Pavilion houses tomes not even found in the Library of Babel. If you have some free time, you might want to explore them yourself.",
  ["1001072401_68"]="Yuanquan lets out a heartfelt sigh.",
  ["1001072401_69"]="With the fall of Bifang, Ji Xia, the royal family, and even the Loong itself... there will be no more immortals in the land of Qian.",
  ["1001072401_7"]="But regardless...",
  ["1001072401_70"]="Thus, we've finally fulfilled the promise WeiShi made thousands of years ago, remaining true to our original intentions.",
  ["1001072401_71"]="By the Emperor's decree, death is eternally banished, but without attending to the living how can we continue obsessing over the divine?",
  ["1001072401_72"]="I apologize for getting sentimental, Head Librarian. One tends to get nostalgic with age.",
  ["1001072401_73"]="Now, it's our turn to repay Eme-an's kindness.",
  ["1001072401_75"]="Bring us the gift, Yuli.",
  ["1001072401_76"]="Following his words, the elderly man gently taps the ground with his cane.",
  ["1001072401_77"]="Amidst the gentle rustling of strings, a figure silently emerges from the shadows, her steps almost imperceptible.",
  ["1001072401_78"]="...",
  ["1001072401_79"]="I'm sorry for keeping you waiting... Head Librarian.",
  ["1001072401_80"]="I recognize the girl standing before me. It was her who wielded the huge puppet in QingYu City, blocking Li Chi's lethal strike.",
  ["1001072401_81"]="But now, she's nothing like the girl she used to be. The sharpness in her is gone, softened into something… timidity.",
  ["1001072401_82"]="She delicately opens the folder in her arms, checks its contents, and hands it over cautiously.",
  ["1001072401_83"]="While you were taking a break, our members were dispatched to Obed to examine the ruins of the Tower of Babel... These are their initial findings.",
  ["1001072401_84"]="We've already begun planning the Tower's restoration. However, with the grand scale of the tower itself, even with Qian's capability, we cannot guarantee complete restoration of the tower within a short term.",
  ["1001072401_85"]="Nevertheless, you might already know that what truly matters isn't the Tower of Babel itself, but you and the Beacon in your possession.",
  ["1001072401_86"]="The Beacon is the key for returning to the Library, and you're the one holding the key.",
  ["1001072401_87"]="Even if we manage to restore the Tower as a \"vessel\" to access the Library, the real challenge is how to awaken the Beacon in your hand...",
  ["1001072401_88"]="I've analyzed everything that went down in CangLin City and QingYu City.",
  ["1001072401_89"]="I have a theory. Not completely certain, but a very accurate one.",
  ["1001072401_9"]="This almost feels like a dream...",
  ["1001072401_90"]="For some mysterious reason, the Beacon seems to have a strong connection to you personally.",
  ["1001072401_91"]="It's not just because you're the Head Librarian. None of the previous Head Librarians had such a direct connection to the Library like you do.",
  ["1001072401_92"]="Furthermore, it appears that the influence of other Beacons is the catalyst for the reopening of the Library.",
  ["1001072401_93"]="Please allow this old one to be so bold to ask, what is your plans for the future?",
  ["1001072401_95"]="I understand.",
  ["1001072401_96"]="We'll provide assistance in our best efforts.",
  ["1001072401_97"]="To be honest, WeiShi alone won't be enough to rebuild the Tower. As the leader of the Secret Alliance, you should reach out to other groups, like Florentine in the west.",
  ["1001072401_98"]="In terms of wealth, aside from the distant Polestar, Florentine is second to none.",
  ["1001072401_99"]="With that said, the situation is complicated in Japheth at the current, with the Duchess of Florentine at the center of vortex. If you decide to set off for Japheth, we'll provide the necessary intelligence you need.",
  ["1001072501_1"]="The sky looms overhead, and Tianchi Lake's waters remain tranquil.",
  ["1001072501_10"]="Noon approaches, yet Ming is nowhere to be found... Could she have encountered trouble at the Tianli ancestral home?",
  ["1001072501_12"]="Yes.",
  ["1001072501_13"]="Descending the cliffs, we soon reach the Tianli ancestral home.",
  ["1001072501_14"]="Rough scaffolding surrounds the decaying structure, but the expected hustle and bustle of workers is notably absent.",
  ["1001072501_15"]="Only a few Tianli clan members are engaged in a passionate discussion about weapon marks on the brick wall.",
  ["1001072501_16"]="Puzzled by the scene, I feel a soft tap on my back.",
  ["1001072501_17"]="Good mor... Oh, it's already noon.",
  ["1001072501_19"]="Sorry about that. The situation here turned out to be more complicated than I had anticipated.",
  ["1001072501_2"]="As Ming mentioned, the onset of fall is the perfect time for admiring Mount Tianque's scenery.",
  ["1001072501_20"]="Is there anything wrong?",
  ["1001072501_21"]="Well, nothing major, just... a hiccup in the plan.",
  ["1001072501_22"]="Despite some negotiation, everything went smoothly at first, and Tianli clan agreed to our proposal, but then...",
  ["1001072501_23"]="Ming turns toward the chamber nestled within the mansion, a hint of hesitation flickering across her face.",
  ["1001072501_25"]="Yeah, ever since he returned from the underground palace, he's been locking himself up in his room, sulking about something.",
  ["1001072501_26"]="The reconstruction work involves not just renovating the building but also repelling wild beasts in the mountain's depths.",
  ["1001072501_27"]="Without the patriarch's approval, everything comes to a standstill.",
  ["1001072501_29"]="As I approach Li Chi's chamber, faint noises emanate from within.",
  ["1001072501_3"]="Three days swiftly pass, signaling the time to rendezvous with Ming.",
  ["1001072501_30"]="However, as I knock on the door, the noise abruptly ceases.",
  ["1001072501_31"]="Dear guests... are you here for Li Chi?",
  ["1001072501_32"]="Yeah, according to Ming, he hasn't left his room for days.",
  ["1001072501_33"]="Ah, it is no big deal. It's just a childish outburst, locking himself in to make a scene. A mature individual like yourself will give him space and not take his tantrum seriously.",
  ["1001072501_34"]="On any other day, we'd summon his family, have them drag him to the ancestral shrine, and give him an earful!",
  ["1001072501_35"]="But with all the recent changes, even us elders are facing unfamiliar situations... Maybe we should allow him some time to process everything.",
  ["1001072501_36"]="I'd prefer to wait, but we can't delay... The entire construction team is prepared at the mountain's base.",
  ["1001072501_37"]="Well, we still have numerous vacant rooms here, so finding lodging won't be an issue. Moreover, we've nearly driven away all the contaminated beasts, so perhaps we'll just...",
  ["1001072501_38"]="Elder! Something's gone wrong! Those beasts are acting up today, breaking through our fences and heading towards us!",
  ["1001072501_39"]="As I turn around, several contaminated beasts breach the dilapidated courtyard wall, charging toward us.",
  ["1001072501_4"]="However, as noon arrives, the girl who agreed to meet us here is nowhere to be found.",
  ["1001072501_40"]="The foremost beast darted past us, crashing into Li Chi's room with a metallic clang.",
  ["1001072501_42"]="Before we can react, a commotion erupts from inside the house.",
  ["1001072501_43"]="Initially, the sounds of a beast pouncing and objects toppling fill the air, followed by the heavy crunch of a bed board, a mix of surprised and angry exclamations, and finally, the unmistakable sound of a blade being unsheathed.",
  ["1001072501_44"]="Shortly after, a cerulean figure is tossed out from the door. The beast rolls and whimpers, then vanishes beyond the courtyard wall into the forest.",
  ["1001072501_45"]="You pesky beast! Get out of here!",
  ["1001072501_46"]="Li Chi dashes out, holding his blade in one hand and clutching a handful of animal hair in the other.",
  ["1001072501_47"]="Are you alright, Patriarch?",
  ["1001072501_48"]="A mere beast can't lay a scratch on me!",
  ["1001072501_49"]="Where is everyone else? Who allowed those beasts in?",
  ["1001072501_5"]="Ming hasn't shown up yet. Could she be facing some difficulties?",
  ["1001072501_50"]="Surveying the courtyard amidst the beasts' tumult, Li Chi grips the vermilion blade in his hand.",
  ["1001072501_51"]="What a nuisance... Hey, guys! Let's drive these critters out!",
  ["1001072501_52"]="She's probably on her way.",
  ["1001072501_53"]="Maybe she just overslept.",
  ["1001072501_54"]="Let's go look for her.",
  ["1001072501_55"]="Let's head to the ancestral home.",
  ["1001072501_56"]="Weren't you supposed to meet us at Tianchi Lake?",
  ["1001072501_58"]="Li Chi disagreed?",
  ["1001072501_59"]="Something went wrong with the construction?",
  ["1001072501_60"]="Just standing here won't lead us anywhere.",
  ["1001072501_61"]="Let's see if I can talk some sense into him.",
  ["1001072501_62"]="Li Chi is still inside.",
  ["1001072501_63"]="We need to help him!",
  ["1001072501_64"]="To the Outside World",
  ["1001072501_7"]="Zero shakes her head in response.",
  ["1001072501_8"]="It's unusual for Ming to be late without a valid reason.",
  ["1001072501_9"]="Despite Ming's typically casual demeanor, she has never made mistake during our operations.",
  ["1001072502_1"]="Soon, the last beast flees in haste, disappearing from sight.",
  ["1001072502_10"]="Now that you've sorted out the issue, the urgency has eased.",
  ["1001072502_100"]="No, wait... All my scouts have gone silent. What's going on?",
  ["1001072502_101"]="Looks like your scouts are just as useless as your eyes.",
  ["1001072502_102"]="The puppetmaster appears unfazed, emitting only a slight sigh.",
  ["1001072502_103"]="All strings are linked. As I tug on my strings, they're bound to create ripples far and wide.",
  ["1001072502_104"]="The stage is set, the curtain is drawn, and the backdrop is in place. Naturally, that puppetmaster will be part of our play.",
  ["1001072502_105"]="The girl turns around with a playful grin on her lips.",
  ["1001072502_106"]="Considering the prophesied one, I should prepare in advance... A great show needs its cast.",
  ["1001072502_107"]="...",
  ["1001072502_108"]="Ahhh... Can someone translate her riddles into plain human language?",
  ["1001072502_109"]="Well, translation: \"Get to work, my little mercenary.\"",
  ["1001072502_11"]="Observing the Tianli clan members bustling about, I suddenly notice the absence of a certain individual.",
  ["1001072502_110"]="...",
  ["1001072502_112"]="It's about something else.",
  ["1001072502_113"]="Everyone's worried about you.",
  ["1001072502_114"]="But those raccoon eyes of yours...",
  ["1001072502_115"]="You haven't slept in days, have you?",
  ["1001072502_116"]="(Walk away.)",
  ["1001072502_117"]="(Wait for a while.)",
  ["1001072502_118"]="Can we have a proper talk now?",
  ["1001072502_12"]="Peering toward the ancestral home, I spot Li Chi seated under the shattered eaves, his expression somber, lacking the usual joy over victory.",
  ["1001072502_120"]="These two can coexist.",
  ["1001072502_122"]="Since the ancestral rules no longer bind you...",
  ["1001072502_123"]="How about exploring the world beyond the mountains?",
  ["1001072502_124"]="Rules are meant to lead people to a better life.",
  ["1001072502_125"]="But if people exist solely to follow rules, that'd be downright wrong.",
  ["1001072502_126"]="Exactly.",
  ["1001072502_128"]="According to history, Ji Xia also journeyed far and wide.",
  ["1001072502_13"]="...Anything else for me?",
  ["1001072502_130"]="Oh, our poor patriarch has never been on a spring trip...",
  ["1001072502_132"]="You know, CangLin City is hosting the Harvest Festival right now.",
  ["1001072502_133"]="Why not join us at the Festival?",
  ["1001072502_134"]="Don't stress about it too much.",
  ["1001072502_135"]="Just think of it as a fun autumn adventure that's a bit delayed.",
  ["1001072502_136"]="You've got something on your mind, right?",
  ["1001072502_14"]="If it's about repairing the ancestral home, I've already given the order.",
  ["1001072502_15"]="That should put your mind at ease, right?",
  ["1001072502_17"]="Spare me your concerns. It's just some minor stuff.",
  ["1001072502_18"]="Dealt with some statues and beasts, feeling a bit drained... I need some rest. That's all.",
  ["1001072502_19"]="If you don't need anything else, just leave and let me have some peace!",
  ["1001072502_2"]="Hooray! Those pests are gone! Let's chase them out!",
  ["1001072502_21"]="You're being nosy, you know...",
  ["1001072502_22"]="Leaving those words, Li Chi furrows his brow even further, evading interactions as he turns sideways.",
  ["1001072502_24"]="Sensing his growing unease, I feel it best to leave, not wanting to cause further disturbance.",
  ["1001072502_25"]="However, as I take a step, he suddenly turns his head and calls out to me in a hushed tone.",
  ["1001072502_26"]="Wait...",
  ["1001072502_27"]="Li Chi turns to me once more, appearing to have something to share.",
  ["1001072502_29"]="Since you've already figured me out, I don't need to keep it to myself anymore.",
  ["1001072502_3"]="Stop messing around, you rascal! Come back!",
  ["1001072502_30"]="Ever since coming back from the palace, I've been thinking about... the ancestral rules of our clan.",
  ["1001072502_31"]="If those rules were truly just a way to make my people guard the tomb for centuries, as Yuanquan suggested... I could easily toss them aside and free my people.",
  ["1001072502_32"]="But for us, those rules hold deeper meaning.",
  ["1001072502_33"]="Take that decree, \"The Tianli clan must never leave QingYu City.\" To outsiders, it might seem like a restriction, keeping us on this mountain.",
  ["1001072502_34"]="However, to us, that strict decree did guide our ancestors to settle by the mountains, avoid war and conflict, and escape the suffering of displacement... eventually founding the Tianli clan as it is today.",
  ["1001072502_35"]="As the patriarch, it's my duty to grasp the reasons behind those rules, but those words left by Li Jun... Are they the bedrock of our clan? Or just shackles?",
  ["1001072502_37"]="So, you mean...",
  ["1001072502_40"]="Are you suggesting... that I should leave my clan and see the world?",
  ["1001072502_43"]="Li Chi appears momentarily stunned, memories flooding back to a night from years ago.",
  ["1001072502_44"]="Don't worry. Sooner or later, you'll be free from all these burdens and responsibilities.",
  ["1001072502_45"]="He had always thought of it as a jest in his childhood.",
  ["1001072502_46"]="Little did he anticipate that this jest would eventually become a fulfilled promise.",
  ["1001072502_47"]="A fleeting sorrow pierces Li Chi's heart, a shallow mourning settling within.",
  ["1001072502_48"]="Overwhelmed by this complex emotion, he raises his voice.",
  ["1001072502_49"]="Ridiculous! Nobody wants to be like that guy... gallivanting around and neglecting his clan!",
  ["1001072502_5"]="Looks like we can't delay the repair work any longer. It could have been a disaster without your quick help.",
  ["1001072502_50"]="I am the patriarch of the Tianli clan, and I'll carry my responsibilities!",
  ["1001072502_51"]="Watch your tone, Chi! Your friend have come to invite you down the mountain! Don't waste their kindness!",
  ["1001072502_52"]="And you've always wanted to explore beyond QingYu City, right? Remember how eager you were for school trips in spring and fall? How is this any different?",
  ["1001072502_53"]="That... was just childish rambling! Why bring it up now?!",
  ["1001072502_55"]="And you too! Don't make it worse!",
  ["1001072502_56"]="By the way, Li Chi... your house is in ruins now. Where will you stay for the next few weeks?",
  ["1001072502_57"]="Brother Chi will be roughing it on the streets!",
  ["1001072502_59"]="Oh, that Harvest Festival! I've seen it on TV. It's going to be very lively with folks from all over the country coming together to rake in money... Ahem, to celebrate the festival!",
  ["1001072502_6"]="Don't worry, the patriarch has given the go-ahead. Construction will start soon.",
  ["1001072502_60"]="Actually, the younger ones talked about organizing a temple fair here as well, but it fell through due to our lack of experience.",
  ["1001072502_61"]="This is a fantastic opportunity, Chi. Head to CangLin City and learn something new, and maybe we can host our own festival next time, right?",
  ["1001072502_62"]="How about this? We'll double your pocket money this month as an... \"research fund.\"",
  ["1001072502_63"]="What, double my pocket money? Does that mean I can buy all the...",
  ["1001072502_64"]="Wait, wait! That's not the point!",
  ["1001072502_65"]="Triple it! And when you return, make sure to bring back some souvenirs and toys for us to use as inspiration.",
  ["1001072502_66"]="Yeah, I heard they'll have souvenir lanterns at the Harvest Festival. Grab one for me, Patriarch!",
  ["1001072502_67"]="Oh, I want one too!",
  ["1001072502_69"]="...",
  ["1001072502_7"]="But with the ancestral home damaged by beasts, we might not meet the original deadline... Think we can push back the timeline, Ming?",
  ["1001072502_70"]="Let me make this clear: I'm off to CangLin City for some official business for the Tianli clan.",
  ["1001072502_71"]="I'm the patriarch, and I know I shouldn't leave our ancestral home right now. However... Tianli isn't just mine; it belongs to all of us.",
  ["1001072502_72"]="With the old ancestral rules out of the way, we're free from those restrictions. I hope everyone can find their own path in this world.",
  ["1001072502_73"]="But there's one thing...",
  ["1001072502_74"]="Li Chi's tone shifts as he unsheathes his blade.",
  ["1001072502_75"]="Repairing the ancestral home is crucial. Tianli clan has a deal with WeiShi, and we've got to see it through.",
  ["1001072502_76"]="Even though I can't be there in person to supervise, everyone needs to give it their best. If anyone slacks off and brings shame to our clan, there will be consequences!",
  ["1001072502_77"]="Now, I'm entrusting our clan to all of you... When I get back from CangLin City, I hope to see a new and revitalized Tianli clan.",
  ["1001072502_78"]="Haha... you do talk like an old soul for your age.",
  ["1001072502_79"]="We've got this, patriarch. Just head out for the business... and have some fun while you're at it.",
  ["1001072502_8"]="...",
  ["1001072502_80"]="In the outskirts of CangLin City, the farmlands stretch towards the horizon.",
  ["1001072502_81"]="A butterfly dances into the wheat fields, only to be ensnared by an invisible web, fluttering futilely before falling to the ground.",
  ["1001072502_82"]="Delicate strings intertwine amidst the stalks, gently flicked by dexterous hands.",
  ["1001072502_83"]="Like a vicious and deadly joke from a predator.",
  ["1001072502_84"]="Could you please put away those strings, my dear lady?",
  ["1001072502_85"]="Seriously, chasing butterflies at a time like this... Are you being calm or just a bit too relaxed?",
  ["1001072502_86"]="Just cut to the case.",
  ["1001072502_87"]="What I mean is, it's time to do something.",
  ["1001072502_88"]="Plans have changed. That Seer left QingYu City much earlier than expected.",
  ["1001072502_89"]="Their timing lines up perfectly with the Harvest Festival.",
  ["1001072502_9"]="Well, they've put me in charge of overseeing the repairs in case those remaining beasts on the mountain cause trouble.",
  ["1001072502_90"]="Hah, why the fuss over something so trivial?",
  ["1001072502_91"]="Once the strings are out, there's no need for hesitation... The web is woven, and whether it's a bit early or late, it doesn't matter.",
  ["1001072502_92"]="Even that prophesied one won't escape my grasp.",
  ["1001072502_93"]="Speaking of which...",
  ["1001072502_94"]="The swaying strings around Hongxian's hand flicker once more, causing a dragonfly with severed wings to struggle at her feet.",
  ["1001072502_95"]="Any updates on that WeiShi puppetmaster?",
  ["1001072502_96"]="How intriguing. You always boasted about being the top puppetmaster worldwide. Feeling a bit nervous this time? Concerned about competition from a peer?",
  ["1001072502_97"]="I want answers, not more questions.",
  ["1001072502_98"]="Alright, fine. I'll check, but I doubt much has changed on her end. If she's making any moves, my scouts will surely...",
  ["1001072502_99"]="Carmine's words abruptly halt.",
  ["1001072601_1"]="Summer has drawn to a close, with autumnal hues permeating the surroundings.",
  ["1001072601_10"]="Life can really throw some unexpected curveballs. Just a few months ago, I was knee-deep in midterms, worrying about pocket money, and sweating the small stuff.",
  ["1001072601_100"]="...",
  ["1001072601_101"]="Azi? You've been staring at my outfit for a while... Is there something wrong with my clothes?",
  ["1001072601_102"]="Not at all! Your new clothes have this ancient charm and elegance! They suit you perfectly!",
  ["1001072601_103"]="You've got the style. Ever thought about... part-time modeling? There's a store nearby that gives discounts to models buying their clothes. Why not grab some souvenirs before we leave?",
  ["1001072601_104"]="Oh! Why not seize the moment? Let's take a picture right here, right now! Strike a pose, and say \"cheese\"...",
  ["1001072601_105"]="Miss Azi, please hold on...",
  ["1001072601_106"]="Come on, Azi. Let Zero enjoy the Festival in peace...",
  ["1001072601_107"]="We still have work to do. Don't forget that.",
  ["1001072601_108"]="Oh, right! I almost forgot about that.",
  ["1001072601_109"]="Let's leave the shopping for later. We've got work to do, so we'll head out. And if you ever think about modeling, be sure to reach out to me—",
  ["1001072601_11"]="Who could've guessed that Tianli Mountain held a thousand-year-old history waiting to be uncovered by us?",
  ["1001072601_111"]="Phew, she was surprisingly quieter than usual.",
  ["1001072601_112"]="Normally, she'd be snapping photos and live streaming, coming up with catchy headlines like \"Tang Sect Superstar's Marvelous Return!\" or \"Surprise! Meeting a Mysterious Lady at the Festival!\"",
  ["1001072601_114"]="More like she remembered her duties and rushed off... Azi might seem laid-back most of the time, but she knows when to focus.",
  ["1001072601_115"]="Anyway, Head Librarian and Zero, put aside your worries and enjoy this Harvest Festival as our special guests.",
  ["1001072601_116"]="How do you like it?",
  ["1001072601_117"]="It's totally worth the trip, right?",
  ["1001072601_118"]="Absolutely, it's a deal.",
  ["1001072601_119"]="Yeah, if I'm still in Qian.",
  ["1001072601_12"]="However, Ji Xia is not a god. He represents the origin of countless generations—a starting point and nothing more.",
  ["1001072601_120"]="You chubby chicken!",
  ["1001072601_122"]="I'll skip the \"just trying to please\" bit.",
  ["1001072601_124"]="It's pretty impressive.",
  ["1001072601_125"]="It really suits you.",
  ["1001072601_126"]="It feels a bit lousy.",
  ["1001072601_127"]="Not as ancient as expected?",
  ["1001072601_128"]="Not as mysterious as expected?",
  ["1001072601_129"]="In that case...",
  ["1001072601_13"]="We don't believe in gods or saints. We believe in ourselves and our ability to shape our own destiny.",
  ["1001072601_130"]="Hey, let's go check out that shop over there.",
  ["1001072601_131"]="Long time no see.",
  ["1001072601_132"]="Happy Harvest Festival!",
  ["1001072601_133"]="About the aftermath of the Cerulean Blight...",
  ["1001072601_134"]="Has the effect of the Cerulean Water been cleared up?",
  ["1001072601_135"]="But honestly, I don't remember anything about it.",
  ["1001072601_136"]="No problem. Saving the world is kind of my thing.",
  ["1001072601_137"]="...",
  ["1001072601_139"]="But if I actually altered the time flow...",
  ["1001072601_14"]="However, Ji Xia is not a god. He represents the origin of countless generations—a starting point, and nothing more.",
  ["1001072601_140"]="Why does everyone seem oblivious to what happened?",
  ["1001072601_141"]="...",
  ["1001072601_142"]="Finally, the super-energetic duo is gone.",
  ["1001072601_143"]="So, she's changing her approach?",
  ["1001072601_145"]="Harvest's Prelude",
  ["1001072601_15"]="We don't believe in gods or any divine beings. We believe in ourselves and our ability to shape our own destiny.",
  ["1001072601_16"]="If that founding emperor were still here to witness the current splendor of CangLin City, what expression would he don?",
  ["1001072601_17"]="As I am engulfed in a sense of melancholy, I feel a sharp, unidentified object pecking at the back of my head.",
  ["1001072601_18"]="Upon turning around, I notice that Li Chi has moved on to another stall, and in his place is a plump bird with fluttering wings.",
  ["1001072601_19"]="Hey, you! Yeah, I'm talking to YOU! Lil Missy skipped her reading time and dressed up this morning just to hit the shops with you!",
  ["1001072601_2"]="Stepping into the city streets, I notice that the perpetual verdant shades in my memories have long faded, replaced by the golden hues emblematic of the harvest season.",
  ["1001072601_20"]="And now you've left her hanging to chat with someone else?! Is this how you treat a lady?!",
  ["1001072601_22"]="An... tone it down a bit.",
  ["1001072601_23"]="Zero, now dressed in a light-colored, elegant dress, catches the bird attempting to hide under her cloak.",
  ["1001072601_24"]="In contrast to her previous somber, all-black attire, the white cape stands out on her figure, creating a striking image in the vibrant market where Zero stands out like a solitary beacon.",
  ["1001072601_25"]="I went back to organize the documents... then changed into the outfit Yuli tailored for me.",
  ["1001072601_26"]="Is there... anything wrong?",
  ["1001072601_27"]="Before I can react, the plump bird wriggles free from Zero's grasp and circles above my head.",
  ["1001072601_28"]="Hey, Lil Missy is talking to you! Are you deaf or what?!",
  ["1001072601_29"]="Chirp! In moments like this, whether you're sincere or just trying to please, you should respond in a way that delights the lady to her core! Without any delay!",
  ["1001072601_3"]="The city, teeming with picturesque autumnal scenery and the influx of tourists, greets us at the peak of the Harvest Festival.",
  ["1001072601_31"]="Is that the point?! The point is, without any delay!",
  ["1001072601_32"]="Do I really need to explain this to you? Chirp...",
  ["1001072601_33"]="An, you're being loud... and rude.",
  ["1001072601_34"]="...!",
  ["1001072601_35"]="Okay, don't keep the young miss waiting! Tell her what she wants to hear! RIGHT NOW!",
  ["1001072601_37"]="You wanna get smacked?",
  ["1001072601_38"]="Before I can make a joke, Anchirp breaks free from Zero's hold and pecks at my head.",
  ["1001072601_39"]="...!",
  ["1001072601_4"]="CangLin City... it truly lives up to its name.",
  ["1001072601_40"]="Following a crisp knock, the indignant bird pauses briefly in mid-air before plummeting to the ground.",
  ["1001072601_41"]="Just ignore An's ramblings.",
  ["1001072601_43"]="...",
  ["1001072601_44"]="Zero's eyes flickers slightly as if stirred by something subtle.",
  ["1001072601_45"]="Thank you.",
  ["1001072601_46"]="Since we got to Qian, we've been caught in all sorts of challenges.",
  ["1001072601_47"]="Today is the first chance we've had to really take in the sights.",
  ["1001072601_48"]="In the Library, I've read many books about Qian... always painted as an ancient and mysterious place.",
  ["1001072601_49"]="But being here, it's not quite what I had in mind.",
  ["1001072601_51"]="It's more... lively than I envisioned from the texts.",
  ["1001072601_52"]="Rather than \"mysterious,\" it's more like \"profound.\"",
  ["1001072601_53"]="Qian, much like Obed, holds a wealth of history. However, the perspective on history here is a bit different.",
  ["1001072601_54"]="To Eme-an, history feels like a weighty volume.",
  ["1001072601_55"]="We delve into history, capturing the past within its pages. While we occasionally flip through that volume, we're well aware that...",
  ["1001072601_56"]="Regardless of how much glory and decline in Obed are tales of bygone days.",
  ["1001072601_57"]="Zero lifts her head, scanning the bustling street.",
  ["1001072601_58"]="Here in Qian, those legends and histories feel like they're still intertwined with the people around us.",
  ["1001072601_59"]="The fireworks during the festival, the Loong and other mythical creatures on the sugar paintings, and even the designs on those paper lanterns... It's as if these tales have persisted through time in a unique way.",
  ["1001072601_6"]="Hmm, not bad at all.",
  ["1001072601_60"]="This all feels... new.",
  ["1001072601_62"]="Across the carnival, Ming leans against the wall, observing the Head Librarian with a detached air, unaffected by the festive atmosphere.",
  ["1001072601_63"]="Now that I've accompanied the Head Librarian to the Festival, I can finally call it a day.",
  ["1001072601_64"]="But going straight back to WeiShi might not be the best idea. If Qing spots me, I might get pulled into some messy tasks once more.",
  ["1001072601_65"]="Maybe I'll just find a quiet spot to rest for a bit, then...",
  ["1001072601_66"]="Surprise! Look who I ran into here! A wild Ming Xiaomin!",
  ["1001072601_67"]="Gah... why does it have to be you, of all people?",
  ["1001072601_68"]="Hey, [BBNAME], Zero, and Ming! You guys are back? Wanna grab a bite to eat?",
  ["1001072601_69"]="Navigating through the crowd, Azi firmly takes Ming's hand and comes at us, followed by Xin, who is busy shoveling snacks into her mouth.",
  ["1001072601_7"]="We'll have a temple fair in our clan soon, and it'll be even better than this one... You'll have to come and show your support then.",
  ["1001072601_71"]="Heeeey! Did you have a good time in QingYu City?",
  ["1001072601_72"]="Wait, where's our little short-fused patriarch?",
  ["1001072601_73"]="He's the patriarch, after all, and has his own matters to attend to, so we simply let him be.",
  ["1001072601_74"]="What kind of \"matters\" could he possibly have at a festival like this? Probably just wandering around and buying souvenirs, I guess?",
  ["1001072601_75"]="Maybe his people are looking into developing some tourism projects, like festivals and temple fairs. That's why they've sent our young fella here for a bit of market research!",
  ["1001072601_77"]="Given the circumstances, I believe the only factor causing this phenomenon is... you.",
  ["1001072601_78"]="So, even for those who were contaminated, it's not a lost cause.",
  ["1001072601_79"]="According to the scholars from Delphic Oracle who helped us analyze the Cerulean Water, the water can transform carbon-based life forms into metal-based ones.",
  ["1001072601_80"]="But it's not an instant change. This transformation requires a continuous intake of Cerulean Water. So, if the exposure is mild, the effects of the water will fade away as the body naturally deals with it over time.",
  ["1001072601_81"]="Sure, some effects might linger, but we're closely monitoring those with noticeable symptoms. They should be back to normal soon.",
  ["1001072601_82"]="However, for the animals outside the city, it's a different story. Many of them drink the downstream water from the Grandeur River, and they're... beyond cure.",
  ["1001072601_83"]="Since there are so many of them, we've set up a quarantine zone to handle them in groups. We'll observe them closely before starting the neutralization process, taking it step by step.",
  ["1001072601_84"]="Still, I think the main thing is... what Master Yuanquan mentioned.",
  ["1001072601_85"]="Upon finishing her words, Ming shoots me a meaningful glance.",
  ["1001072601_86"]="According to the report, the \"time\" in CangLin City has been cut off from our main timeline and trapped in a static temporal realm.",
  ["1001072601_87"]="Given the circumstances, I believe the only factor causing this phenomenon is... you.",
  ["1001072601_88"]="If our Head Librarian hadn't stepped in and stopped the time flow in CangLin City during that downpour... This city wouldn't be as peaceful as it is now.",
  ["1001072601_9"]="Those WeiShi folks mentioned that you come from a place called Obed and had quite the adventurous journey to CangLin City. Your stop in Qian is probably just a break in your longer journey, right?",
  ["1001072601_90"]="Ah! I get it! It's like a \"backup energy\" or \"power surge\" kind of deal!",
  ["1001072601_91"]="Our Head Librarian only unleashes the hidden power in dire situations to save the day! Just like in the movies!",
  ["1001072601_92"]="Yeah, I get it! It's like catching a whiff of food when you're starving, right? Even if you're exhausted, a sudden burst of energy hits you once you smell food.",
  ["1001072601_94"]="How about we just act like we've never met each other...?",
  ["1001072601_96"]="This is because commoners lack the ability to perceive changes in time flow. The static time will naturally adjust itself in their perception through a self-correcting process.",
  ["1001072601_97"]="It's like hay fever in spring or heatstroke in summer. People will only remember this year as having a \"seasonal illness\" of blue skin but with a broader impact and longer duration.",
  ["1001072601_98"]="Secretary Qing insists on hosting the Harvest Festival to offer a final explanation for the incident, helping people get back on track, I suppose.",
  ["1001072601_99"]="Sensing the intense stares from others, Zero tilts her head slightly.",
  ["1001072602_1"]="Judging by the tracks, I think it's from the hydroponic farming area.",
  ["1001072602_10"]="More precisely, instead of a driver, there is something unusual there.",
  ["1001072602_11"]="The cab emits a strong burning odor, with a thin layer of ash coating the seats and steering wheel as if licked by flames.",
  ["1001072602_12"]="Whoa... what on earth is this?! Is this van haunted? Or did the driver make a run for it before we got here?",
  ["1001072602_13"]="No, I didn't see any footprints along the way.",
  ["1001072602_14"]="But this is weird. The equipment and dashboard look normal, and there's no sign of a self-driving system... Maybe this van really is haunted?",
  ["1001072602_15"]="The smell is odd.",
  ["1001072602_16"]="Like burnt wood, but not quite.",
  ["1001072602_17"]="Look, here's the thing.",
  ["1001072602_18"]="Xin leans in, takes a quick sniff, then sweeps away the ash with her foot, revealing half-burnt deadwood underneath.",
  ["1001072602_19"]="Though charred black, the wood resembles a humanoid figure driving the van, its \"arms\" rigidly outstretched.",
  ["1001072602_2"]="But something's off. I remember this path being closed to traffic during the Harvest Festival. Thankfully, we got here just in time and avoided any potential issues...",
  ["1001072602_21"]="This doesn't add up. Why would someone place a chunk of wood in the cramped cab?",
  ["1001072602_23"]="Eek! D-don't startle me like that!",
  ["1001072602_24"]="Then why not just toss it in the trunk?",
  ["1001072602_25"]="Well, let's not make wild guesses... Hang on, I'll call Ming Xiaomin over to take a look.",
  ["1001072602_26"]="What's going on?",
  ["1001072602_28"]="I don't get it.",
  ["1001072602_29"]="Just a burnt piece of wood, it seems.",
  ["1001072602_3"]="That reckless driver! I have some serious questions for them now!",
  ["1001072602_30"]="Maybe the wood is haunted.",
  ["1001072602_31"]="Could be a souvenir bought on the way.",
  ["1001072602_4"]="Xin grips the door handle, opening it forcefully.",
  ["1001072602_5"]="...!",
  ["1001072602_6"]="I thought Xin would reprimand the driver inside, but to my surprise, Xin recoils instinctively and stands frozen in place.",
  ["1001072602_8"]="...Take a look yourself.",
  ["1001072602_9"]="Following Xin's gaze, all I see is... an empty driver's seat.",
  ["1001072701_1"]="Earlier at CangLin municipal government.",
  ["1001072701_10"]="This Harvest Festival isn't just about the harvest. It stands as a token of gratitude to each and every one of you who wholeheartedly contributed to this city.",
  ["1001072701_100"]="After a prolonged moment, I quietly speak up, breaking the silence.",
  ["1001072701_102"]="I see...",
  ["1001072701_103"]="Xin, please accompany our Head Librarian.",
  ["1001072701_104"]="The path to Mr. Nong's place goes through the hydroponic farming area, with lots of twists and turns... Having a guide will make things easier.",
  ["1001072701_105"]="The sky extends high; the rice ears droop low.",
  ["1001072701_106"]="The golden hue symbolizing a bountiful harvest has replaced the summer's greenery, spreading like a picturesque scroll over the fertile plains.",
  ["1001072701_107"]="However, amidst this scroll, a subtle yet unsettling touch of red emerges.",
  ["1001072701_108"]="Dark red strings quietly weave among the rice ears, ensnaring any insects, birds, or beasts that stray too close, entwining them until they succumb to their fate.",
  ["1001072701_109"]="She knows all too well that only \"that person\" would leave such a repulsive mark.",
  ["1001072701_11"]="I hope all of us enjoy the well-deserved fruits of our labor.",
  ["1001072701_110"]="We're too late, Sue.",
  ["1001072701_111"]="Hongxian... she's already gone.",
  ["1001072701_112"]="No, I think we've arrived just in time.",
  ["1001072701_113"]="You mean... you can still sense her presence, Sue?",
  ["1001072701_114"]="Definitely. Even though her scent is fading, she's still here, in this vast granary.",
  ["1001072701_115"]="...",
  ["1001072701_116"]="Tell me where she is. I'll get there right away.",
  ["1001072701_117"]="Before her words leave her lips, Yuli already starts moving.",
  ["1001072701_118"]="However, the puppet beside her, seemingly unaware of her unease, remains still.",
  ["1001072701_119"]="Are you really planning to do that?",
  ["1001072701_12"]="Taking a bow, Qing notices a slight perspiration on her palms.",
  ["1001072701_120"]="Trying to find one person in a huge city is like searching for a needle in a haystack.",
  ["1001072701_121"]="But if we leave her unchecked...",
  ["1001072701_122"]="Remember what I taught you, Yuli?",
  ["1001072701_123"]="Puppetry can be complex or simple, but it all comes down to one rule: pull the strings and go with the flow.",
  ["1001072701_124"]="Instead of searching for her, maybe we should ask: why did she hastily leave without finishing setting the trap for us?",
  ["1001072701_125"]="Is it because... we showed up?",
  ["1001072701_126"]="A puppetmaster uses their strings as weapons. No, she knew we were coming from the beginning.",
  ["1001072701_127"]="...",
  ["1001072701_128"]="I heard the Head Librarian mentioned talking about heading back to CangLin City soon. Could it be...",
  ["1001072701_129"]="Exactly.",
  ["1001072701_13"]="It has been quite a trek.",
  ["1001072701_130"]="You've realized it, right? Those puppets hidden in the city are being guided to a specific spot by invisible strings.",
  ["1001072701_131"]="Hongxian never wastes her setups. Perhaps that Head Librarian is right here, amidst these fields now.",
  ["1001072701_132"]="I see...",
  ["1001072701_133"]="Then let's not waste any time, Sue.",
  ["1001072701_134"]="(Pick it up.)",
  ["1001072701_135"]="I was just passing through.",
  ["1001072701_136"]="The culprits should be the ones saying sorry.",
  ["1001072701_137"]="(Share our findings with Qing.)",
  ["1001072701_138"]="Do you need any help with anything?",
  ["1001072701_139"]="Alright, another task for me.",
  ["1001072701_14"]="From that riverside walk to the Harvest Festival, only a summer has passed, yet it feels like an eon.",
  ["1001072701_140"]="How's Mr. Nong doing?",
  ["1001072701_141"]="I'd like to pay him a visit.",
  ["1001072701_142"]="...Still, I'd like to pay a visit.",
  ["1001072701_144"]="Rising Storms",
  ["1001072701_15"]="Nevertheless, she is not permitted to take a break even now.",
  ["1001072701_16"]="She knows well that there are still many \"rats\" snooping around in the abundant granary.",
  ["1001072701_17"]="Well put, Secretary Qing.",
  ["1001072701_18"]="...",
  ["1001072701_19"]="A round of applause brings her back from her thoughts.",
  ["1001072701_2"]="...Dear citizens and guests from afar, as the Zhi Jing of the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity, I am pleased to bring forth some encouraging updates.",
  ["1001072701_20"]="You know what? I made the right call letting Secretary Qing wrap up the speech.",
  ["1001072701_21"]="If things go smoothly in the next few days, we might get a break from our usual routines and enjoy the Harvest Festival.",
  ["1001072701_22"]="Hey everyone, we're swamped all the time. Who knows when we'll have free time again?",
  ["1001072701_23"]="How about we make today special? Now that work's done, let's grab a meal together.",
  ["1001072701_24"]="Great idea! I'll pack my stuff.",
  ["1001072701_25"]="I know this restaurant run by a native of the Jiangyin Region. Their fish stew recipe is to die for...",
  ["1001072701_26"]="I haven't been there in six months because of my heavy workload. How about we dine there, then relax over some tea and chat at leisure?",
  ["1001072701_27"]="...",
  ["1001072701_28"]="The last time we dined together was when I first got here, Secretary Qing. Today is a rare occasion. Will you join us?",
  ["1001072701_29"]="Yeah, you played a key role in sorting out this issue. Come join us!",
  ["1001072701_3"]="According to the latest water quality report issued by the Bureau of Health & Welfare, the containment of contamination in Grandeur River has been successful. Consequently, the quarantine zones along the riverbanks are gradually reopening, allowing individuals to once again leisurely stroll along the riverbank, fish, and swim.",
  ["1001072701_30"]="Sure, since you're all insisting, I'll gladly...",
  ["1001072701_31"]="At that instant, a beep from Qing's communicator interrupts her words.",
  ["1001072701_32"]="(Did something happen at the Festival?!)",
  ["1001072701_33"]="Qing's gaze scans the message, her composed demeanor frozen.",
  ["1001072701_34"]="Thank you for inviting me, but there are some minor issues at the Harvest Festival that I need to handle personally.",
  ["1001072701_35"]="Go ahead with your dinner plans. No need to wait for me.",
  ["1001072701_36"]="As soon as Qing enters the hall of WeiShi, a member rushes over, presenting several reports to her.",
  ["1001072701_37"]="Besides the van at the accident site, we noticed significant damage to the quarantine zone in the hydroponic farming area, and the contaminated farm animals inside have become restless.",
  ["1001072701_38"]="The worst-case scenario has come true.",
  ["1001072701_39"]="Could our adversary be trying to disrupt the Harvest Festival through this?",
  ["1001072701_4"]="Additionally, the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture has noted progress. Field samples indicate that most crops have returned to their normal growth cycle.",
  ["1001072701_40"]="No, it can't be that simple... Double-check for any missed clues. Leave no stone unturned.",
  ["1001072701_41"]="Ah, we've found something new.",
  ["1001072701_42"]="Along with the mentioned issues, the van crashed into a small substation before heading towards the residential area.",
  ["1001072701_43"]="The substation controls the power supply to checkpoints at the city entrances and exits... All the details are listed here.",
  ["1001072701_44"]="With a solemn expression, Qing accepts the reports.",
  ["1001072701_45"]="So, the affected entrances are in four different directions: north, west, southwest, and east?",
  ["1001072701_46"]="If they're aiming to sow chaos and slip away, there couldn't be a better opportunity...",
  ["1001072701_47"]="Could this... be linked to Wushi?",
  ["1001072701_48"]="He's breached into the Bureau of Employment & Social Support and Bureau of Civil Security databases multiple times, even discovering the existence of WeiShi.",
  ["1001072701_49"]="Since we're on the lookout for saboteurs in the city, he's definitely the prime suspect. Maybe he's planning to sabotage the checkpoints and make a run for it!",
  ["1001072701_5"]="I won't say much. I'm sure all of you at this Festival have already felt this positive shift.",
  ["1001072701_50"]="Following a brief moment of reflection, Qing adjusts her glasses.",
  ["1001072701_51"]="I don't think so.",
  ["1001072701_52"]="While he was once our foe and seemed extremely hostile, his actions always had motives. Given that recent event... he wouldn't leave CangLin City at a time like this.",
  ["1001072701_53"]="Let's not dwell on him too much. Assemble a team to repair the breached quarantine zone and another team to inspect all checkpoints. If anything seems off, report to me immediately.",
  ["1001072701_54"]="And then...",
  ["1001072701_55"]="Get Xin and Azi to me right away. If I'm right, they should be at the accident site.",
  ["1001072701_56"]="Hey, hey, Xiaomin? Any leads here?",
  ["1001072701_57"]="...",
  ["1001072701_58"]="Judging by its dense and dark texture, it must be as old as my grandfather.",
  ["1001072701_59"]="Ming's fingers trace along the charred edges, feeling several severed strings.",
  ["1001072701_6"]="Qing pauses momentarily.",
  ["1001072701_60"]="And this wood... has been deliberately crafted and carved into a human form, almost like a piece of handicraft.",
  ["1001072701_61"]="Although I can't jump to conclusions about its purpose just yet...",
  ["1001072701_62"]="While Ming is engrossed in her investigation, the communicator suddenly rings.",
  ["1001072701_64"]="Oh, you're there too, Head Librarian?",
  ["1001072701_65"]="Well, that spot is pretty close to where the Harvest Festival is happening... I apologize for dragging you both into another mess.",
  ["1001072701_67"]="You're too kind.",
  ["1001072701_68"]="Please rest assured. I'll ensure they face the consequences.",
  ["1001072701_69"]="After a brief exchange of pleasantries, I pass the communicator to Xin.",
  ["1001072701_7"]="Lastly, as the Zhi Jing of the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity and a resident of CangLin City, I want to extend my sincere thanks to all citizens and visitors from across the globe.",
  ["1001072701_70"]="Xin and Azi, give me an update on what happened.",
  ["1001072701_71"]="About thirty minutes ago, a van somehow crashed into the hydroponic farming area, smashed through the quarantine barriers, and ended up here.",
  ["1001072701_72"]="This caused quite a stir, with the farm animals getting spooked and running onto the streets.",
  ["1001072701_73"]="Thankfully, we managed to get the animals under control, and no one got hurt... but the quarantine barrier is still broken, and we're trying to figure out how to fix it.",
  ["1001072701_74"]="Great job. Thanks to your quick action, the Harvest Festival can go on smoothly.",
  ["1001072701_75"]="As for the quarantine zone... I've arranged a squad to fix it. You have more pressing matters to attend to.",
  ["1001072701_76"]="Where's the driver of that van?",
  ["1001072701_77"]="...",
  ["1001072701_78"]="...",
  ["1001072701_8"]="From ensuring food supply to maintaining water safety, coordinating logistics, and providing medical care... the challenges we confronted were unprecedented, affecting nearly every facet of everyone's life.",
  ["1001072701_80"]="Upon hearing my account, Qing's expression becomes grave.",
  ["1001072701_81"]="I see...",
  ["1001072701_82"]="Ming and Azi, stay there and make sure no one messes with the scene.",
  ["1001072701_83"]="Our team will be there soon to collect the suspicious object you found. Once that's done, come back to headquarters with everyone.",
  ["1001072701_84"]="As for you, Head Librarian...",
  ["1001072701_86"]="Thank you so much, but that's not necessary. You're a respected guest here, and you've already done so much for us, from CangLin City to Mount Tianque... It'd be impolite to burden you any further.",
  ["1001072701_87"]="Please focus on your plans and leave everything in CangLin City to us.",
  ["1001072701_88"]="If you're bored at the Festival, you might want to check out the Fertile Plains. It's Autumn Equinox, and the views there are stunning... Enjoy your time here.",
  ["1001072701_89"]="Is there a particular place in my mind?",
  ["1001072701_9"]="It's because of your collective efforts that CangLin City was able to overcome these obstacles and bounce back.",
  ["1001072701_90"]="When I first arrived in Qian, my initial memories were of the expansive, green fields.",
  ["1001072701_91"]="And... that amiable elderly man.",
  ["1001072701_92"]="Hah, compared to the whole city, this is just a small garden.",
  ["1001072701_93"]="You'll see in the morning: the entire Fertile Plains is our farmland. Now, that's what I call spectacular, the real granary of the world.",
  ["1001072701_95"]="...",
  ["1001072701_96"]="Mr. Nong... Well, he...",
  ["1001072701_97"]="Silence envelops our conversation.",
  ["1001072701_98"]="Qing's tone remains composed.",
  ["1001072701_99"]="Still, I can sense a hint of indescribable regret and sorrow from the occasional pauses and the subtly trembling inflections.",
  ["1001072801_1"]="Silence persists during my journey.",
  ["1001072801_10"]="The script atop the records appears shaky and hurried, dated to the day the cerulean rain fell.",
  ["1001072801_11"]="Xin picks up the immature rice seedling.",
  ["1001072801_12"]="You know, back when I used to come here to freeload, the old man always said he'd teach me farming if I had the time...",
  ["1001072801_13"]="Then I'd come up with excuses, saying I was clumsy and couldn't handle tasks like planting or tending to crops.",
  ["1001072801_14"]="Finally, when I mustered up the courage to try, I mistook a rice seedling for a weed...",
  ["1001072801_15"]="But the old man reassured me, saying...",
  ["1001072801_16"]="No one is born knowing everything. Making mistakes is a natural part of learning... The key is to pick yourself up after a stumble.",
  ["1001072801_17"]="I didn't realize the old man had kept that rice seedling...",
  ["1001072801_18"]="Almost in response to Xin's words, a sudden breeze slips through the window, causing the papers to drift towards the backyard.",
  ["1001072801_19"]="Hey!",
  ["1001072801_2"]="Once again, I stand in front of this familiar cabin.",
  ["1001072801_20"]="Pursuing the papers, I open the door leading to the backyard...",
  ["1001072801_21"]="The beautiful aspiration harbored since my arrival in Qian is now materializing before my eyes as a golden paradise.",
  ["1001072801_22"]="A hundred acres of seedlings that were mere tufts before have now blossomed into a golden sea of rice.",
  ["1001072801_23"]="A gentle breeze carries the rustle of husks, mingling with the unique aroma of the harvest season.",
  ["1001072801_24"]="This breathtaking scene vividly illustrates why this city is known as \"The Granary of Qian.\"",
  ["1001072801_25"]="I carefully retrieve the papers resting on the grain's undulations.",
  ["1001072801_26"]="Then, I return the papers, as well as the token entrusted to me, to their rightful owner.",
  ["1001072801_27"]="Upon my return to the house, the breeze outside the window has subsided.",
  ["1001072801_28"]="At that moment, I notice Zero in the room, meticulously organizing the reports scattered by the wind.",
  ["1001072801_29"]="I'm not sure what I can still do at time like this...",
  ["1001072801_3"]="Reflecting on my brief journey here, all the incidents and encounters started in this cabin.",
  ["1001072801_30"]="I want to organize things for the homeowner, like I used to do every day at the Library.",
  ["1001072801_31"]="I believe so, too.",
  ["1001072801_32"]="However, while I was sorting through things, I noticed signs that the house had been tidied up.",
  ["1001072801_33"]="Someone else must have visited this cabin recently.",
  ["1001072801_34"]="Zero shakes her head.",
  ["1001072801_35"]="And there's something else worth noting.",
  ["1001072801_36"]="I heard an unusual noise coming from the field, and it's drawing close.",
  ["1001072801_37"]="I'm not certain.",
  ["1001072801_38"]="It's too risky to dash out into the field, and... it might harm the crops.",
  ["1001072801_39"]="I think we should tell Xin about this.",
  ["1001072801_4"]="Why are my memories of that night and the kind old man resurfacing now?",
  ["1001072801_40"]="Upon our return to the backyard, Xin has shifted her posture.",
  ["1001072801_41"]="She squats on the ground, his right hand clutching her spear as if facing an unseen opponent.",
  ["1001072801_42"]="Shh, keep it down... Something's coming our way.",
  ["1001072801_43"]="You mean those contaminated animals?",
  ["1001072801_44"]="Yeah, but it's not that simple, I'm afraid.",
  ["1001072801_45"]="Judging by how they're moving, those animals seem scared of something and are heading towards us.",
  ["1001072801_46"]="What other choice do we have? Let's face them head-on!",
  ["1001072801_47"]="I won't let those beasts destroy the old man's precious plants!",
  ["1001072801_48"]="Mr. Nong, about the thing you asked...",
  ["1001072801_49"]="It's done.",
  ["1001072801_5"]="Qing's hesitant expression already hints at the grim answer.",
  ["1001072801_50"]="We've brought the Harvest Festival back on track.",
  ["1001072801_51"]="That's the best outcome we could hope for.",
  ["1001072801_52"]="Could it have been Qing?",
  ["1001072801_53"]="Could it have been Wushi?",
  ["1001072801_54"]="Could it be contaminated animals?",
  ["1001072801_55"]="Could it be some wildlife?",
  ["1001072801_56"]="Xin?",
  ["1001072801_57"]="What should we do now?",
  ["1001072801_58"]="Shadowed Traces",
  ["1001072801_6"]="Still, I must traverse this neither short nor lengthy path to compose myself and confirm the answer myself.",
  ["1001072801_7"]="As I echo the previous knock, myriad thoughts become a soft sigh.",
  ["1001072801_8"]="Inside the cabin, the windows gleam, suggesting recent cleaning.",
  ["1001072801_9"]="Several observation reports from the test field lie on the desk, placed under a carefully sealed rice seedling.",
  ["1001072802_1"]="With a gentle tug, Yuli prompts her massive puppet to spring forth in graceful arcs, dismantling the foes in front of her.",
  ["1001072802_11"]="That's what makes her so dangerous.",
  ["1001072802_12"]="This puppetmaster is incredibly unpredictable, with a fickle personality, her actions are based entirely on a whim. Even Sue struggles to understand her motives.",
  ["1001072802_13"]="As for this sudden attack... Maybe she sees you as an obstacle to her entertainment.",
  ["1001072802_14"]="Or maybe you're part of her elaborate plan.",
  ["1001072802_15"]="...",
  ["1001072802_16"]="So, you tracked those puppets all the way here, Yuli?",
  ["1001072802_17"]="Yes. According to Sue, instead of blindly chasing the puppetmaster, it's better to uncover the motives behind her intricate web.",
  ["1001072802_18"]="Now it seems our strings have crossed again, Head Librarian.",
  ["1001072802_19"]="Since she's coming after you, please allow me to stay by your side and protect you...",
  ["1001072802_2"]="Head Librarian... Are you okay?",
  ["1001072802_20"]="Before Yuli can finish her sentence, a peculiar sound reverberates across the field.",
  ["1001072802_21"]="Peering down towards the source of the sound, I notice several puppets previously shattered by Yuli.",
  ["1001072802_22"]="Despite having lost their physical integrity, they have not collapsed.",
  ["1001072802_23"]="Instead, they laboriously limp, writhe, and crawl towards us with their damaged bodies.",
  ["1001072802_24"]="Watch out, Head Librarian!",
  ["1001072802_25"]="By the time I hear her voice, a distorted figure concealed in the field has crept to my feet, revealing its murderous eyes.",
  ["1001072802_26"]="A hand emerges from the mud, firmly grasping my ankle.",
  ["1001072802_27"]="...",
  ["1001072802_28"]="Before Yuli's strings arrive, a dagger's characteristic whistle pierces the air.",
  ["1001072802_29"]="As I struggle to realize what has happened, a dagger has plunged into the puppet's forehead.",
  ["1001072802_30"]="Another glint of cold steel flashes, another dagger impaling the puppet's chest before a familiar figure appears beside me.",
  ["1001072802_32"]="...",
  ["1001072802_33"]="Yet, the only response I receive is the edge of steel, devoid of warmth.",
  ["1001072802_34"]="Having decapitated the puppet, Wushi puts his dagger on my neck.",
  ["1001072802_35"]="...!",
  ["1001072802_36"]="You rascal! You haven't had your fill from our last encounter and now you want more trouble?!",
  ["1001072802_37"]="Disregarding Xin's threat, Wushi fixes their gaze on Xin's.",
  ["1001072802_38"]="I'm here to ask you something.",
  ["1001072802_39"]="Once I get the answers I need, I'll leave.",
  ["1001072802_4"]="That's good to hear... If you feel unwell, please let me know.",
  ["1001072802_40"]="If you really want answers, put that dagger down!",
  ["1001072802_41"]="Follow me to our headquarters, and Qing will answer all your questions.",
  ["1001072802_42"]="Tension thickens in the air. The two are locked in a stare-down, indicating a clash looming on the horizon.",
  ["1001072802_43"]="...!",
  ["1001072802_44"]="...",
  ["1001072802_45"]="Witnessing the hesitation on both sides, I raise my hand slightly, signaling for Xin to lower her weapon.",
  ["1001072802_46"]="Then, I glance sideways at Wushi.",
  ["1001072802_47"]="Instead of the silence and murderous intent, his eyes now betray a hint of desperate confusion.",
  ["1001072802_48"]="Tell me, where exactly is she?",
  ["1001072802_49"]="I'm talking about Tiaohua, of course!",
  ["1001072802_5"]="But you seem to be doing just fine, dear Head Librarian.",
  ["1001072802_50"]="Stop playing dumb!",
  ["1001072802_51"]="You're close to WeiShi! How can you not know where she is?!",
  ["1001072802_52"]="...",
  ["1001072802_53"]="That's true. After we bid farewell at Nongsang Pavilion, you went straight to QingYu City.",
  ["1001072802_54"]="I see... If you really knew anything about her, you wouldn't be so calm.",
  ["1001072802_55"]="No, thanks. You're not relevant here, so you won't be of any help.",
  ["1001072802_56"]="Wushi lets out a sigh.",
  ["1001072802_57"]="Releasing the dagger, he maneuvers through us, darting to the field.",
  ["1001072802_58"]="By the time Xin catches up, Wushi has already vanished without a trace.",
  ["1001072802_59"]="Tsk, he's like a sly rabbit darting through the fields!",
  ["1001072802_6"]="Wait—what are you doing here?",
  ["1001072802_60"]="After the encounter, we return to Mr. Nong's cabin.",
  ["1001072802_61"]="Seriously, Wushi is now one of the most dangerous figures in all of CangLin City. I don't think anyone else would be foolish enough like you to negotiate with him.",
  ["1001072802_62"]="After the incident at Nongsang Pavilion, Qing noticed that Wushi didn't escalate things beyond repair, so she let him off the hook temporarily to focus on more urgent matters.",
  ["1001072802_63"]="And Wushi did keep a low profile and stayed out of sight during our time in QingYu City.",
  ["1001072802_64"]="But the peace didn't last long. Not long after the Qingyu City matter was settled, he suddenly started acting crazy again—no one knows what got into him.",
  ["1001072802_65"]="First, he sneaked into the Bureau of Employment & Social Support and the Bureau of Civil Security, rummaging through citizens' profiles. Then he even managed to breach our database!",
  ["1001072802_66"]="Tiaohua is always thoughtful and composed, but how could he, as her brother, be so reckless...?",
  ["1001072802_67"]="Huh? What could he possibly want?",
  ["1001072802_68"]="I just can't understand why he's sneaking around like a thief all day! What's in those records that's worth all this trouble?",
  ["1001072802_69"]="You're close to WeiShi! How can you not know where she is?!",
  ["1001072802_7"]="Back in QingYu City, you mentioned having other matters to attend to and didn't join us... And now you're here in this vegetable garden with us.",
  ["1001072802_70"]="Xin's words only solidify my suspicions.",
  ["1001072802_71"]="Nonsense! We've all been so concerned about her well-being. We've been keeping a close eye on her!",
  ["1001072802_72"]="You know what? I tried to visit her a couple of days ago, but Qing shut it down completely. If it weren't for her interference, I would've...",
  ["1001072802_73"]="A sudden realization halts Xin's words.",
  ["1001072802_74"]="Hold on... Now come to think of it, every time I tried to visit Tiaohua, Qing gave me these vague excuses.",
  ["1001072802_75"]="She's never been like that before.",
  ["1001072802_76"]="Fear and anxiety heighten as Xin mulls over Qing's unusual behaviors that have amassed in her mind, behaviors that would have been ignored in normal circumstances.",
  ["1001072802_77"]="Eventually, an irrefutable conclusion emerges.",
  ["1001072802_78"]="Tiaohua has gone missing.",
  ["1001072802_79"]="Give me the phone! Qing owes me some explanations!",
  ["1001072802_8"]="I was tracking a puppetmaster. She's... somewhere hidden in this city.",
  ["1001072802_80"]="The hospital, the WeiShi headquarters, and Qing... Grasping at straws, Xin dials numbers one after another.",
  ["1001072802_81"]="However, all that greets them is a series of monotonous, cold beeps.",
  ["1001072802_82"]="Yep, I'm fine.",
  ["1001072802_83"]="Not really.",
  ["1001072802_84"]="Why would she come after me?",
  ["1001072802_85"]="I've never even met her, right?",
  ["1001072802_86"]="...Wushi?",
  ["1001072802_87"]="Why are you here, at Mr. Nong's cabin?",
  ["1001072802_88"]="Enough.",
  ["1001072802_89"]="Do you really want to start a fight right outside Mr. Nong's place?",
  ["1001072802_9"]="The puppets that attacked you are her creations.",
  ["1001072802_90"]="If you've got any questions, just go ahead and ask.",
  ["1001072802_91"]="Huh? What's that supposed to mean?",
  ["1001072802_92"]="Who do you mean by \"she\"?",
  ["1001072802_93"]="But isn't she at the hospital?",
  ["1001072802_94"]="You're well aware of my journey, aren't you?",
  ["1001072802_95"]="We haven't met your sister since the incident in CangLin City.",
  ["1001072802_96"]="Wait, what happened to Tiaohua?",
  ["1001072802_97"]="We might be able to help you.",
  ["1001072802_98"]="Maybe Wushi is after something else.",
  ["1001072802_99"]="Because... Tiaohua has gone missing.",
  ["1001072901_1"]="Beep... Beep... Beep...",
  ["1001072901_10"]="According to Sue, the adversary merely performed a surgical-level tampering of our communication system, using our coordinates as a reference...",
  ["1001072901_100"]="The attending doctor suggested that connecting with peers might help her emotionally... Rest assured, that doctor has been with us for a while, and there's never been anything suspicious about him.",
  ["1001072901_101"]="Don't be so jumpy. I've checked the new girl's background. Her parents are from the Jiangyin Region, and she's grown up in CangLin City since childhood. Nothing suspicious there.",
  ["1001072901_102"]="It's probably fine to leave it there. With so many of us keeping an eye on her, what could possibly go wrong?",
  ["1001072901_103"]="...Despite the bumpy ride, I managed to make it to CangLin City safely, all thanks to my brother and Master's help.",
  ["1001072901_104"]="Whew... I haven't talked this much ever since my brother and sister Xin got swamped with work.",
  ["1001072901_105"]="Oh, I hope I didn't bore you. Or... did I, Hongling?",
  ["1001072901_106"]="Not at all! I could listen to your stories all day!",
  ["1001072901_107"]="But if you live in the Western Region, that's quite a trek back home! Just thinking about it gives me a headache...",
  ["1001072901_108"]="Well, don't fret. I'm not that attached to my home, really...",
  ["1001072901_109"]="Home, for me, is wherever my brother is.",
  ["1001072901_11"]="It could be quite a while before anyone notices the problem here.",
  ["1001072901_110"]="Sounds like you have a dependable brother... Care to share more about him?",
  ["1001072901_111"]="About my brother...?",
  ["1001072901_112"]="Yeah... or maybe you'd rather not talk about him?",
  ["1001072901_113"]="No, not at all. It's just that it's rare for someone to be interested in hearing about my brother.",
  ["1001072901_114"]="Well, let's keep it between us. It's just the two of us here... You know, things have been strange since that girl moved in.",
  ["1001072901_115"]="Let me cut to the chase: something's definitely off about that girl named Liu Hongling.",
  ["1001072901_116"]="Wait, really? I checked her medical records, and they match up perfectly with the Civil Security Bureau records from top to bottom.",
  ["1001072901_117"]="But have you looked into the records at the Bureau of Roads & Travel? They show that Liu Hongling left for the Hanze Region with her parents just a couple of days ago.",
  ["1001072901_118"]="So, she hurried back quietly and settled in so quickly in just a matter of days? I don't think a young girl like her could pull that off.",
  ["1001072901_119"]="...Have you mentioned this to anyone else?",
  ["1001072901_12"]="Then what are we waiting for?! If we can't reach Qing, I'll track down Wushi myself for some answers... I won't let him slip away!",
  ["1001072901_120"]="Of course I tried, and more than once, but... it always hits a dead end at some point, no response at all. So, I'm counting on you to pass my message along directly.",
  ["1001072901_121"]="Got it, leave it to me. I'll put together a report and find an opportunity while getting supplies to discreetly inform Secretary Qing.",
  ["1001072901_122"]="By the way, I've been doing all the talking since you got here, Hongling. I haven't heard any of your stories.",
  ["1001072901_123"]="...Is there something you find hard to talk about?",
  ["1001072901_124"]="Not really, it's just that my hometown is in the Jiangyin Region, all about rivers and lakes, not much exciting to share.",
  ["1001072901_125"]="What about your parents?",
  ["1001072901_126"]="You must be dealing with a tough illness like me, but strangely, you've never mentioned your parents, and they've never visited you...",
  ["1001072901_127"]="Well, they're pretty busy, and I shouldn't add to their burden.",
  ["1001072901_128"]="...",
  ["1001072901_129"]="Come on, let's change the topic. How about we play a game, like... hide and seek?",
  ["1001072901_13"]="In a split second, Xin has assumed a poised stance, ready to spring onto the rooftop.",
  ["1001072901_130"]="You hide, and I'll seek. I'll start counting to ten, okay?",
  ["1001072901_131"]="Ten, nine, eight...",
  ["1001072901_132"]="W-wait, let me adjust my wheelchair...",
  ["1001072901_133"]="Recalling that member's comments, I can't shake the eerie feelings evoked by this girl named Liu Hongling.",
  ["1001072901_134"]="Despite her innocence befitting a girl of Tiaohua's age, there is an indescribable sense of displacement in her words and behaviors.",
  ["1001072901_135"]="It feels as if... she's been playing a specific role.",
  ["1001072901_136"]="Found you.",
  ["1001072901_137"]="Upon regaining awareness, I find myself face-to-face with the girl.",
  ["1001072901_138"]="For a moment, my thoughts feel entangled as if bound by strings.",
  ["1001072901_139"]="Are you alright, Head Librarian...? You struggle with your breathing all of a sudden.",
  ["1001072901_14"]="Back off! Get in my way and you'll regret it!",
  ["1001072901_140"]="Alright, game's done!",
  ["1001072901_141"]="Let's switch to playing house now.",
  ["1001072901_142"]="This time, you'll be the brother, and I'll be the sister!",
  ["1001072901_143"]="In the next breath, the girl reverts back to her innocent demeanor as if the previous gaze was a figment of my imagination.",
  ["1001072901_144"]="However, it is at this moment that I truly realize that... I am being watched.",
  ["1001072901_145"]="How did... that thing turn out?",
  ["1001072901_146"]="Why so secretive? What thing are you talking about?",
  ["1001072901_147"]="The thing you mentioned. Any updates from Secretary Qing's end?",
  ["1001072901_148"]="Um... Oh, that thing!",
  ["1001072901_149"]="After writing it, I had second thoughts, and honestly... I think you might be overreacting.",
  ["1001072901_15"]="Tsk...",
  ["1001072901_150"]="So, I ended up tearing up the letter and burning it. You know, some information is just too sensitive to share with anyone else!",
  ["1001072901_151"]="Damn! When did they...?!",
  ["1001072901_152"]="Where are we going, Hongling?",
  ["1001072901_153"]="The doctor says I need to stay here a bit longer, and if I have to go out... I should inform my brother.",
  ["1001072901_154"]="Hongling? Are you listening?",
  ["1001072901_155"]="Didn't you mention wanting to go out someday, Tiaohua? Today seems perfect for an adventure.",
  ["1001072901_156"]="Surveying her surroundings, Tiaohua finally notices the abnormalities around her.",
  ["1001072901_157"]="Everything in the hospital appears to be still, as if frozen in time. Doctors, patients, and even the usual onlookers are noticeably absent.",
  ["1001072901_158"]="Where are the other people in the hospital...? What did you do to them?!",
  ["1001072901_159"]="No... who are you really?!",
  ["1001072901_16"]="Despite her eagerness to retort to my prodding, Xin pauses, recalling the recent chase. When it comes to stealth, Wushi excelled.",
  ["1001072901_160"]="Confronted by Tiaohua's questions, Hongling maintains her usual smile.",
  ["1001072901_161"]="Well, well. It wouldn't be true to character if I answered using my identity as Hongling.",
  ["1001072901_162"]="Anyway, think of this as a regular outing, okay?",
  ["1001072901_163"]="It's just that... we're going to a place even farther than the Northern Region, and grander than the Boundless Mountain.",
  ["1001072901_164"]="There, someone will reveal everything to you, my dear... immortal one.",
  ["1001072901_165"]="*Cough* Just as I feared, they've taken Tiaohua from the hospital.",
  ["1001072901_166"]="But it's not too late. I'll inform Secretary Qing and inform her of the situation here. We can still sort this out...",
  ["1001072901_167"]="Argh! Why won't this call connect?!",
  ["1001072901_168"]="Beep... Beep... Beep...",
  ["1001072901_169"]="The only response is a series of suffocating beeps.",
  ["1001072901_17"]="In the end, Xin vents her frustration with a heavy stomp on the ground.",
  ["1001072901_170"]="Alas, the hide and seek game is up.",
  ["1001072901_171"]="What? You.. you are...!",
  ["1001072901_172"]="Shhh, we're in a hospital, remember? Keep your voice down.",
  ["1001072901_173"]="Before the member can utter a word, invisible threads seal her mouth completely.",
  ["1001072901_174"]="Then a figure emerges, an exact replica of the WeiShi member in physique and facial features.",
  ["1001072901_175"]="Tell me about your duties.",
  ["1001072901_176"]="Watch over things, ensure security, keep in touch with WeiShi regularly, and... leave no traces behind.",
  ["1001072901_177"]="That's my boy. Well, now that everything's set, let's welcome our...",
  ["1001072901_178"]="Last esteemed actor.",
  ["1001072901_179"]="A familiar chill creeps over me.",
  ["1001072901_18"]="What should I do then?! I can't get hold of anyone by phone, and you won't let me chase after Wushi... Are we just going to stand here doing nothing?!",
  ["1001072901_180"]="The moment I sense the gaze, strings start to weigh down my neck, heart, and fingers, enveloping me entirely.",
  ["1001072901_181"]="In this moment, my body and mind freeze, akin to prey ensnared in a spider's web.",
  ["1001072901_182"]="Spying on a girl's secrets isn't a good habit, little rat.",
  ["1001072901_183"]="Hasn't that puppetmaster warned you about that? When you're watching the puppets, they're watching you too.",
  ["1001072901_184"]="Get out of this memory, Head Librarian! This is a...",
  ["1001072901_185"]="Click.",
  ["1001072901_186"]="Yuli's voice abruptly vanishes, extinguishing the last flicker of hope.",
  ["1001072901_187"]="Perfect, no interruptions now.",
  ["1001072901_188"]="Ominous footsteps draw nearer, revealing a jovial figure before my eyes.",
  ["1001072901_189"]="While my little puppet has already greeted you, since this is our first proper meeting, let me introduce myself!",
  ["1001072901_19"]="Ever since the accident at the festival, something hasn't felt right... Every event, every detail we've encountered today seems to have been manipulated by someone behind the scenes, giving me an uneasy feeling that's hard to describe.",
  ["1001072901_190"]="Nice to meet you. I'm Hongxian, meaning \"red string.\"",
  ["1001072901_191"]="Just like your pathetic partner, I'm a puppetmaster skilled in manipulating strings and people's souls.",
  ["1001072901_192"]="Relax, I just want to get to know you better. You are the legendary prophesied one, after all.",
  ["1001072901_193"]="This space is formed from both our consciousnesses. Your struggle to breathe is because our memories are... blending together.",
  ["1001072901_194"]="The strings enveloping my body tighten once more, as if demonstrating her prowess.",
  ["1001072901_195"]="I've skillfully woven many distractions into the puppet's memories, yet you still managed to uncover Tiaohua's secrets.",
  ["1001072901_196"]="If I hadn't looked back one more time... you'd have been a nasty spoiler upon returning to the real world. Perhaps even better than that poor puppet could have done.",
  ["1001072901_197"]="It's not often I get this opportunity. Will you allow me to see what you have foreseen?",
  ["1001072901_198"]="Well, well. I won't take \"no\" for an answer!",
  ["1001072901_199"]="Silent, huh? I'll take that as a yes!",
  ["1001072901_2"]="...",
  ["1001072901_200"]="However, connecting my puppet network directly to your memories might have some side effects.",
  ["1001072901_201"]="You see, when a drop of water falls into the ocean, no matter how it struggles, it simply merges in, right?",
  ["1001072901_202"]="The red strings constrict before my eyes.",
  ["1001072901_203"]="Memories are like a derailed train, unstoppably slipping away in the opposite direction.",
  ["1001072901_204"]="Amidst this critical moment, a familiar presence surfaces in my memories.",
  ["1001072901_205"]="Leave now.",
  ["1001072901_206"]="This realm is not for you to pry.",
  ["1001072901_207"]="My body… the threads… it all feels so heavy. And these memories… are they really bigger than the entire puppet network?",
  ["1001072901_208"]="No... no way! Memory space has always been my domain! How could I be manipulated like a puppet?!",
  ["1001072901_209"]="...",
  ["1001072901_21"]="Yuli contemplatively raises their chin as if a memory has just resurfaced.",
  ["1001072901_210"]="H-hold on! These are...! Ahh... argh...!",
  ["1001072901_211"]="The puppetmaster's pupils dilate, the scarlet hue flickering and shifting, reflecting numerous images, voices, and emotions alien to her.",
  ["1001072901_212"]="She tries to fight it, but the threads in her hands twist into a tangled mess, too weak to hold back the surge of incoming data. She tries to run, but the surrounding information crashes over her like a wave, engulfing her completely.",
  ["1001072901_213"]="When a drop of water falls into the ocean, it simply merges blends in. However, what if the drop contains an entire universe?",
  ["1001072901_214"]="The puppetmaster's malevolent words materialize within her: her voice and appearance dissipate like crushed dust, merging into the torrent.",
  ["1001072901_215"]="Once more, the golden figure and I remain the sole entities in this realm.",
  ["1001072901_216"]="...",
  ["1001072901_217"]="Close your eyes. I'll guide you back to where you belong...",
  ["1001072901_218"]="That ethereal voice exudes absolute authority.",
  ["1001072901_219"]="In the next instant, everything around me flickered like a passing mirage.",
  ["1001072901_22"]="Well, there's something else that caught my attention.",
  ["1001072901_220"]="The strings enveloping my body dissolved into distant ripples.",
  ["1001072901_221"]="Any progress?",
  ["1001072901_222"]="The situation seems...",
  ["1001072901_223"]="It's more complicated than we expected.",
  ["1001072901_224"]="(Stop Xin.)",
  ["1001072901_225"]="Wushi is also searching for Tiaohua.",
  ["1001072901_226"]="Even if we catch him, it won't lead us anywhere.",
  ["1001072901_227"]="Besides...",
  ["1001072901_228"]="Can you really catch up to him?",
  ["1001072901_229"]="Those sabotaged communication devices...",
  ["1001072901_23"]="Although subtle, the tampered parts have strange scents mixed in.",
  ["1001072901_230"]="What else have you found?",
  ["1001072901_231"]="Memories?",
  ["1001072901_232"]="Mark?",
  ["1001072901_233"]="Sounds scary.",
  ["1001072901_234"]="Sounds fascinating.",
  ["1001072901_235"]="(Step forward.)",
  ["1001072901_236"]="(Hesitate.)",
  ["1001072901_237"]="(Steel my will.)",
  ["1001072901_238"]="(Trust my hands to Yuli.)",
  ["1001072901_239"]="So, that sudden car crash...",
  ["1001072901_24"]="These scents are similar to the ones on the puppets that attacked us.",
  ["1001072901_240"]="So, this communication blockage...",
  ["1001072901_241"]="Tiaohua?",
  ["1001072901_242"]="Why is she in these memories?",
  ["1001072901_243"]="...!",
  ["1001072901_244"]="...",
  ["1001072901_245"]="Oh, it's nothing.",
  ["1001072901_246"]="...!",
  ["1001072901_247"]="What do you want?",
  ["1001072901_248"]="But I refuse.",
  ["1001072901_249"]="...",
  ["1001072901_25"]="...",
  ["1001072901_250"]="WeiShi",
  ["1001072901_251"]="Veiled Clarity",
  ["1001072901_252"]="Are you truly prepared, the prophesied one?",
  ["1001072901_253"]="Remember, when you're watching the puppets, they're watching you too. Once you're in, there's no turning back with all these intertwined strings.",
  ["1001072901_254"]="Sue...?",
  ["1001072901_26"]="Nemesis.",
  ["1001072901_27"]="It's Nemesis...",
  ["1001072901_28"]="Cleaned and restored, the once-charred wood reveals its original form.",
  ["1001072901_29"]="It is a wooden humanoid puppet in the size of an adult. Despite the charred remnants from the fire, it showcases intricate mechanisms driven by strings.",
  ["1001072901_3"]="No luck so far. I've tried all the contact details Qing gave us, but...",
  ["1001072901_30"]="Inform our teams to block off all the main roads affected by the substation incident. I'll contact the Bureau of Roads & Travel for additional support soon.",
  ["1001072901_31"]="Everyone, check your terminals for the operation plans. Head to your positions quickly.",
  ["1001072901_32"]="Without any hesitation, everyone in the once quiet hall swiftly springs into action, akin to a fast-forwarded tape.",
  ["1001072901_33"]="Can you reach the Head Librarian, Azi?",
  ["1001072901_34"]="No, I can't get through to the Head Librarian or our members near the agriculture district... and no luck with Xin either.",
  ["1001072901_35"]="Qing furrows her brows, a sudden alertness washing over her.",
  ["1001072901_36"]="Communicator, gather everyone from the agricultural district at the hydroponic farming area. Make sure not to miss any node.",
  ["1001072901_37"]="I'm on it! Almost there...",
  ["1001072901_38"]="Hmm? This is strange. I can't establish any connection from here. Wait... all nodes in the hydroponic farming area went offline an hour ago!",
  ["1001072901_39"]="We've been had. To have them outwitted us on our own turf.",
  ["1001072901_4"]="This is more than just a communication issue, Head Librarian.",
  ["1001072901_40"]="Azi and Ming, it seems like you'll have to head to the agricultural district... Make sure the Head Librarian stays safe no matter what.",
  ["1001072901_41"]="Sure, but there's something I haven't quite figured out yet.",
  ["1001072901_42"]="Go ahead and speak.",
  ["1001072901_43"]="Nemesis didn't appear when the Cerulean Blight was at its worst, but they suddenly showed up after the Beacon was deactivated. I wonder why?",
  ["1001072901_44"]="They must be after something, right?",
  ["1001072901_45"]="With a serious expression, Qing adjusts her glasses.",
  ["1001072901_46"]="\"The Dragon Pillar has fallen, and immortality has been erased. After the crisis in QingYu City was resolved, the flow of time in CangLin City returned to normal, and people recovered from the effects of the Cerulean Water.\"",
  ["1001072901_47"]="To prevent unwanted external queries regarding immorality, we've agreed to inform other organizations in the alliance as such.",
  ["1001072901_48"]="But in reality, there is still one person affected by the Cerulean Water named Tiaohua.",
  ["1001072901_49"]="Wait, are you talking about Xin's friend...?",
  ["1001072901_5"]="Sue and I checked the nearby communication facilities in the area using strings, and we discovered... signs of deliberate sabotage.",
  ["1001072901_50"]="Exactly.",
  ["1001072901_51"]="Tiaohua is suffering from an incurable illness. In an attempt to save her life, her relative got Cerulean Water from an unknown source and gave it to her.",
  ["1001072901_52"]="Therefore, unlike other citizens who were mildly affected, she drank Cerulean Water directly, and her level of immortality... might even rival that of Ji Xia.",
  ["1001072901_53"]="That would certainly be tempting for Nemesis.",
  ["1001072901_54"]="Despite our precautions, Nemesis managed to infiltrate faster than anticipated.",
  ["1001072901_55"]="But... for someone as important as Tiaohua, the organization should have assigned dedicated protection.",
  ["1001072901_56"]="Even Nemesis can't make such a key person disappear without a trace.",
  ["1001072901_57"]="Well... that's where it gets strange.",
  ["1001072901_58"]="The truth is, Tiaohua isn't the only one who's missing.",
  ["1001072901_59"]="All our members who were monitoring and escorting Tiaohua in the entire block vanished at the same time.",
  ["1001072901_6"]="That's absurd! How could Qing miss such a major communication breakdown?!",
  ["1001072901_60"]="Phew... That's the last one!",
  ["1001072901_61"]="Following Yuli's command, we swiftly gather all the puppets that attacked us.",
  ["1001072901_62"]="The puppets, previously fierce, now obediently form a circle under Yuli's guidance, resembling oversized rag dolls.",
  ["1001072901_63"]="Can we really track down those Nemesis scoundrels with these wooden blocks? I'll be furious if all this effort leads to nothing!",
  ["1001072901_64"]="Don't worry. Puppets are guided by memories just like humans. And memories... always leave a mark.",
  ["1001072901_65"]="Have you heard of puppetry? It's a performance where the puppetmaster manipulates puppets to behave like humans.",
  ["1001072901_66"]="These puppets don't have minds of their own. Their emotions and every action are controlled by their master.",
  ["1001072901_67"]="With memories of soldiers, they imitate soldiers wielding weapons; with memories of craftsmen, they act out craftsmen using tools.",
  ["1001072901_69"]="You're making things complex. In reality, you can compare puppets to something similar in nature.",
  ["1001072901_7"]="Upon hearing Xin's words, the puppet behind Yuli appears amused and chuckles.",
  ["1001072901_70"]="If you think of a puppet as a program platform in a computer, memories are the code the puppetmaster writes to achieve specific behaviors.",
  ["1001072901_71"]="Since these puppets were here to attack you, they naturally contain commands related to this behavior.",
  ["1001072901_72"]="Yeah, and Sue can reverse-engineer these puppets to relive everything they've experienced.",
  ["1001072901_73"]="It's just that...",
  ["1001072901_74"]="Yuli pauses, turning her ethereal gaze towards me.",
  ["1001072901_75"]="The memories of these puppets are fragmented. Merely piecing them together would drain most of Sue's energy.",
  ["1001072901_76"]="I'm worried that I alone can't unravel the secrets behind these puppets and uncover the mastermind behind the scenes.",
  ["1001072901_77"]="Head Librarian, would you... join me on this journey?",
  ["1001072901_78"]="You're quite brave to agree so quickly, but...",
  ["1001072901_79"]="Why the hesitation? If you're not up for it, let me handle it! We can't afford to waste any time.",
  ["1001072901_8"]="The Fertile Plains have numerous communication towers. Even if a few go down, it might just seem like a common technical glitch.",
  ["1001072901_80"]="I can do it for you too.",
  ["1001072901_81"]="I hesitate to put Zero in any danger, particularly because she is my most reliable safeguard. As for Xin, she may not be as skilled in managing such delicate tasks. With these considerations in mind, I decide to take the lead and move forward.",
  ["1001072901_82"]="Are you truly prepared, the prophesied one?",
  ["1001072901_83"]="Remember, when you're watching the puppets, they're watching you too. Once you're in, there's no turning back with all these intertwined strings.",
  ["1001072901_84"]="Sue...?",
  ["1001072901_85"]="Got it.",
  ["1001072901_86"]="Please hold my hand, Head Librarian.",
  ["1001072901_87"]="Her touch feels cold, like ceramic. Although the warmth from her palm is evident, a subtle, elusive sensation seeps through.",
  ["1001072901_88"]="Then, please relax.",
  ["1001072901_89"]="Picture yourself in a room, weaving a garment from countless memories...",
  ["1001072901_9"]="Huh? What's she even talking about?",
  ["1001072901_90"]="A sense of emptiness unfolds as my surroundings and tactile sensations gradually fade away like a slideshow.",
  ["1001072901_91"]="Don't worry. Just a minor hiccup, it'll be back up soon. Plus, I'm keeping an eye on things at the substation. If anything goes down in the agricultural district, I'll report it right away.",
  ["1001072901_92"]="Come on, mate! Just swinging by the city for some gas, then back out... Don't fret! I promise not to disrupt the Harvest Festival!",
  ["1001072901_93"]="The fog that clouded my vision dissipates, allowing me to delve deeper into the puppet memories.",
  ["1001072901_94"]="While we're not sure about the cause of your symptoms, your vitals are stabilizing. Some light rehab should help, and you'll be discharged after the observation period.",
  ["1001072901_95"]="Oh, by the way... a new girl will be moving into your ward tomorrow. She's about the same age as you, so maybe you'll get along well.",
  ["1001072901_96"]="Sure, we'll be on good terms...",
  ["1001072901_97"]="This indicates that those puppets disguised as citizens had direct contact with her.",
  ["1001072901_98"]="Please hold on, Head Librarian... I'll gather all the relevant fragments for you.",
  ["1001072901_99"]="This is absurd! We've stressed so many times that Tiaohua is a special patient! Why was she moved to a shared ward?",
  ["1001073001_1"]="My consciousness drifts into vast emptiness.",
  ["1001073001_10"]="While we were exploring those memories, someone... infiltrated this memory.",
  ["1001073001_11"]="Less than a minute...",
  ["1001073001_12"]="But during that time, no matter what Sue tried, she couldn't bring you back to consciousness.",
  ["1001073001_13"]="You suddenly blacked out, sweating and murmuring in your sleep. Yuli was so worried that she almost cried.",
  ["1001073001_14"]="Here, have some water, take a breath, and tell us what you saw.",
  ["1001073001_17"]="So, you're saying that Tiaohua got captured by Hongxian?",
  ["1001073001_18"]="No wonder Qing suddenly ordered us to work in pairs a while back... Something serious must have gone down in the hospital.",
  ["1001073001_19"]="Reflecting on it, I can't help but gasp in astonishment.",
  ["1001073001_2"]="My thoughts resemble a lost ship, adrift amidst the waves in turmoil.",
  ["1001073001_20"]="Now I understand why I had unusual feelings about the car accident at the Festival, the puppet attack, the communication disruption, and the disappearance of Tiaohua.",
  ["1001073001_21"]="Because all these events were orchestrated by Hongxian.",
  ["1001073001_23"]="What you saw were memories from a few days ago. If the worst has happened... that scoundrel has likely taken Tiaohua out of this city.",
  ["1001073001_24"]="Did you catch any glimpses beyond CangLin City, Seer?",
  ["1001073001_26"]="If Hongxian had left the city... she wouldn't have needed to do this.",
  ["1001073001_27"]="So, you mean... those scoundrels are still in the city?",
  ["1001073001_28"]="Definitely. Even now, Sue can sense the presence of those puppets... and Hongxian.",
  ["1001073001_29"]="But why would she remain in the city after abducting Tiaohua? Waiting to be caught by us?",
  ["1001073001_3"]="Head Librarian... Stay with us...",
  ["1001073001_30"]="A true hunter bides their time before striking.",
  ["1001073001_31"]="With that competent Secretary overseeing everything, even a skilled puppetmaster like Hongxian would find it challenging to slip past her vigilant gaze.",
  ["1001073001_32"]="However... if she chooses to act on a day when the city streets are teeming with people, that changes the game.",
  ["1001073001_34"]="Yeah, typically, getting into the city involves strict regulations and special routes. But during the Harvest Festival... it's a whole different story.",
  ["1001073001_35"]="People from every nook and cranny of the globe swarm in during the Festival, which means they ease up on the usual entry and exit rules.",
  ["1001073001_36"]="That's why those Nemesis scoundrels thought it was the perfect opportunity, blending into the crowds and causing distractions to take Tiaohua away!",
  ["1001073001_38"]="That would be a bit tricky.",
  ["1001073001_39"]="While you were unconscious, all the puppets in the room mysteriously went up in flames. Xin and I tried to salvage what we could, but...",
  ["1001073001_4"]="Momentarily, a strand of string drifts through the darkness.",
  ["1001073001_40"]="The puppets, previously arranged in a circle, now lie scattered on the ground, their bodies charred.",
  ["1001073001_41"]="Don't worry. I already backed up their memories when I sensed Hongxian's presence.",
  ["1001073001_42"]="However... it'll take some time to sort through the memories related to your friend from those fragments.",
  ["1001073001_43"]="Since I regain my consciousness, the female puppet beside Yuli has been guiding the strings as if weaving something intricate.",
  ["1001073001_44"]="The jumble of threads is now on the brink of becoming a complete map.",
  ["1001073001_45"]="Speaking of Hongxian, she's a puppetmaster like you, right? What's your connection with her?",
  ["1001073001_46"]="Puppetmaster... Hongxian... I...",
  ["1001073001_47"]="Somehow, Yuli's speech falters as if trying to recall something.",
  ["1001073001_48"]="Sensing Yuli's uneasiness, Sue's fingertips quiver slightly. As the vibrations of the strings settle, Yuli regains her usual composure.",
  ["1001073001_49"]="No, I've never met her, and I don't know where her malice comes from.",
  ["1001073001_5"]="Please... wake up...!",
  ["1001073001_50"]="All I know for sure is that she, like me, comes from an ancient puppetmaster lineage and is a master of puppetry.",
  ["1001073001_52"]="Humans are complex and have different natures. Each person has their own unique traits.",
  ["1001073001_53"]="In human society, you have similar institutions like \"schools,\" right? Even if students are taught by the same instructors and learn the same material...",
  ["1001073001_54"]="Eventually, they may end up on entirely different paths for various reasons.",
  ["1001073001_55"]="Our role as puppets is merely to impart the art of puppetry to those who deserve it. As for where those puppetmasters end up... that's not our concern.",
  ["1001073001_57"]="Yuli seems attuned to my doubts.",
  ["1001073001_58"]="Please don't pay attention to the details. Sue's a puppet, and some of her statements might not align with human logic.",
  ["1001073001_59"]="...Hold on, I've found something.",
  ["1001073001_6"]="As I instinctively grasp the string, my hazy consciousness clears.",
  ["1001073001_60"]="The threads in Sue's hands have been woven into a map, strings intertwining intricately, converging into three distinct strands.",
  ["1001073001_61"]="Sue has pieced together the movement patterns of those puppets. It seems they didn't move together but split in three directions.",
  ["1001073001_62"]="Can we figure out where Tiaohua might be?",
  ["1001073001_63"]="Tiaohua's presence is detected in... all the three directions.",
  ["1001073001_64"]="What did you say?",
  ["1001073001_65"]="It's highly unlikely for a regular person to cover that much ground... and even more so given your friend's condition.",
  ["1001073001_66"]="Regardless, we don't have much choice. This is our only lead on Tiaohua. Even if it's a nasty trap... we'll have to push forward!",
  ["1001073001_67"]="Let's split up. I'll head east, and you two can check the other directions.",
  ["1001073001_69"]="Don't worry. Sue's strings will keep us connected.",
  ["1001073001_70"]="With her words, Yuli retrieves several bamboo tubes from her pocket, each adorned with fine silk threads.",
  ["1001073001_72"]="With these tubes, we can stay in touch even if regular communication fails.",
  ["1001073001_73"]="(Open my eyes.)",
  ["1001073001_75"]="What... just happened?",
  ["1001073001_76"]="How long was I out?",
  ["1001073001_77"]="(Tell them what I saw.)",
  ["1001073001_79"]="We've got to find that puppetmaster soon.",
  ["1001073001_8"]="Thank goodness... you're awake...",
  ["1001073001_81"]="No.",
  ["1001073001_82"]="The memories stopped as they left the hospital.",
  ["1001073001_83"]="The Harvest Festival.",
  ["1001073001_85"]="That makes sense.",
  ["1001073001_86"]="Can we figure out a way to track down Hongxian?",
  ["1001073001_87"]="So, you both learned from the same puppetmaster?",
  ["1001073001_88"]="Why would she want to harm us?",
  ["1001073001_89"]="(Wait, puppets teaching puppetmasters?)",
  ["1001073001_90"]="(Did she mix up the subject and object?)",
  ["1001073001_91"]="But communication is down. Spreading out now could be risky.",
  ["1001073001_93"]="Pursuit",
  ["1001073002_1"]="It's safe now.",
  ["1001073002_11"]="Phew, that's a relief. I've found Tiaohua too.",
  ["1001073002_12"]="Those Nemesis jerks scattered puppets everywhere and stashed her in a hidden spot...",
  ["1001073002_13"]="If I hadn't reacted quickly, they might have taken her!",
  ["1001073002_15"]="Huh? Then who is this girl...? Are there two Tiaohuas?",
  ["1001073002_16"]="What's wrong, sister Xin? You look... concerned?",
  ["1001073002_17"]="At the moment, Yuli's voice reaches her ears via the thread.",
  ["1001073002_18"]="Step away from them! They're not your friend...",
  ["1001073002_19"]="They're puppets controlled by Hongxian!",
  ["1001073002_2"]="Take my hand. We'll get you out of here.",
  ["1001073002_20"]="A shiver runs down my spine.",
  ["1001073002_21"]="Just like your pathetic partner, I'm a puppetmaster skilled in manipulating strings and people's souls.",
  ["1001073002_22"]="It dawns on me that I have overlooked something crucial.",
  ["1001073002_23"]="*Crunch*",
  ["1001073002_24"]="As Yuli's words fade, the girl in the wheelchair emits a mechanical noise akin to gears grinding together.",
  ["1001073002_25"]="You're... not my brother...",
  ["1001073002_26"]="What are you, really?!",
  ["1001073002_27"]="Suddenly, the \"Tiaohua\" before me starts twitching eerily, her limbs contorting inhumanly, crawling swiftly towards me.",
  ["1001073002_29"]="However, the anticipated impact does not occur.",
  ["1001073002_3"]="However, we are met with lusterless eyes.",
  ["1001073002_30"]="Before Zero can stop the puppet, a cold light flashes as the puppet leaps.",
  ["1001073002_31"]="A black dagger precisely pierces the puppet's shell, anchoring itself in the pivotal point where all strings intertwine, securing the puppet in place.",
  ["1001073002_32"]="Turning towards the direction from which the dagger flies, I see that familiar figure once again.",
  ["1001073002_33"]="...",
  ["1001073002_34"]="Looks like she's still reeling from the recent events.",
  ["1001073002_36"]="Everything's going smoothly.",
  ["1001073002_37"]="Tiaohua is safe and sound.",
  ["1001073002_38"]="Wait, you said you found Tiaohua...?",
  ["1001073002_39"]="But isn't she with us now?",
  ["1001073002_4"]="You're... not my brother...",
  ["1001073002_40"]="...!",
  ["1001073002_5"]="I... can't go with you...",
  ["1001073002_6"]="...",
  ["1001073002_8"]="At that moment, Xin's voice resonates through the string.",
  ["1001073002_9"]="Hey, how's it going on your end?",
  ["1001073101_1"]="The puppet is rendered inoperative, but Zero maintains a firm grip on her weapon, vigilantly observing Wushi's movements.",
  ["1001073101_10"]="Since you're here, I assume you've figured out what has happened.",
  ["1001073101_100"]="She hastily implants altered memories into puppets for her own agenda.",
  ["1001073101_101"]="Picture a blend of a soldier's memories with a beast's instincts, stripped of all external influences. What do you get from that mix?",
  ["1001073101_103"]="Exactly, and that's precisely what Hongxian has been doing.",
  ["1001073101_104"]="These puppets attacking us aren't even aware of their actions—they're merely acting on instinct, driven by altered memories.",
  ["1001073101_105"]="Do you recall the memories in the hospital, Head Librarian?",
  ["1001073101_107"]="That's right. Hongxian spent a lot of time with your friend... I'm afraid that's how she absorbed many memories about Tiaohua.",
  ["1001073101_108"]="If it was merely about creating puppets... she wouldn't have gone to such lengths.",
  ["1001073101_110"]="Just then, the long-silent communicator suddenly rings.",
  ["1001073101_111"]="Ugh, when will this device ever connect... Ohhh! It's working! Finally!",
  ["1001073101_113"]="Yep, it's me. How are things on your end? Nothing too terrible, I hope?",
  ["1001073101_114"]="Oh! You won't believe what happened here!",
  ["1001073101_115"]="We ran into a bunch of wooden figures with human faces on the way! To deal with them, we...",
  ["1001073101_116"]="Using the just-repaired emergency line for a chat? Seriously?",
  ["1001073101_117"]="If Qing finds out and gives you an earful... don't blame me for not warning you.",
  ["1001073101_118"]="Following a startling gasp, Azi's voice abruptly vanishes.",
  ["1001073101_12"]="I can tell if it's my sister or just a fake.",
  ["1001073101_120"]="It's urgent, so let's keep it short.",
  ["1001073101_121"]="When Azi reported the communication issue, Qing realized it was intentionally blocked and dispatched a repair team.",
  ["1001073101_122"]="Despite the twists and turns, they managed to get the job done.",
  ["1001073101_123"]="Additional support is on the way. Communication in this area should be back to normal soon.",
  ["1001073101_125"]="Well... that's not my area of expertise. I'll pass the call on to my colleagues.",
  ["1001073101_126"]="Everyone has their strengths. I'll relay this to Secretary Qing.",
  ["1001073101_127"]="Thanks for your help.",
  ["1001073101_128"]="(Remain silent.)",
  ["1001073101_129"]="These puppets look exactly like Tiaohua.",
  ["1001073101_13"]="They're puppets with a human resemblance... I chased them all the way here and took down every one of them.",
  ["1001073101_130"]="I didn't think you'd... have the heart to do that.",
  ["1001073101_131"]="Do puppets have their own thoughts?",
  ["1001073101_132"]="Do puppets have their own emotions?",
  ["1001073101_133"]="Aren't puppets just tools to be manipulated?",
  ["1001073101_139"]="A killing machine.",
  ["1001073101_14"]="No two leaves are the same, but they're not completely different either.",
  ["1001073101_142"]="Hongxian...",
  ["1001073101_143"]="Tiaohua...",
  ["1001073101_147"]="Whatever her motives may be...",
  ["1001073101_148"]="We can't let her have her way anymore.",
  ["1001073101_149"]="Azi?",
  ["1001073101_15"]="Imitation is a puppet's nature. Even for someone with Vision, telling those puppets apart from the real Tiaohua is no easy feat.",
  ["1001073101_151"]="How did you find out about the situation here?",
  ["1001073101_152"]="You're quicker than I thought.",
  ["1001073101_153"]="About Nemesis...",
  ["1001073101_154"]="About Wushi...",
  ["1001073101_155"]="Puppet",
  ["1001073101_16"]="Those poor little ones are probably just bait...",
  ["1001073101_17"]="...",
  ["1001073101_18"]="At that moment, a burst of hurried footsteps resonates from nearby, heading straight for Wushi.",
  ["1001073101_19"]="Hey, when did you arrive...? Stop right there!",
  ["1001073101_2"]="...",
  ["1001073101_20"]="I have no time for games.",
  ["1001073101_21"]="Without waiting for Xin's approaching footsteps, Wushi leaps up, disappearing like at the end of the street like a shadow.",
  ["1001073101_23"]="At this moment, on the other side of CangLin City.",
  ["1001073101_24"]="A van is driving steadily along the highway away from the city.",
  ["1001073101_25"]="Hey, hey. Are you awake?",
  ["1001073101_26"]="She's been out for ten minutes. Is she still breathing?",
  ["1001073101_27"]="Are you kidding me? I've put so much effort into this operation, and now it might fall apart if my partner is killed...",
  ["1001073101_28"]="Gwaah...",
  ["1001073101_29"]="As if to reassure Carmine, the long-dormant Hongxian shudders, emitting a low murmur as she struggles to speak.",
  ["1001073101_3"]="Stay there. Don't come any closer.",
  ["1001073101_30"]="Ah, she's alive.",
  ["1001073101_31"]="How... can a mere human reach that level... Is it because of that old woman?",
  ["1001073101_32"]="No, not even she can handle such a massive amount of information... That was an insanely huge data load! Come on, that's unfair!",
  ["1001073101_33"]="Hah, first time I've seen you gritting your teeth... Did you mess up?",
  ["1001073101_34"]="None. Of. Your. Business!",
  ["1001073101_35"]="Hongxian glares fiercely at her companion, then swiftly reverts to her usual casual demeanor.",
  ["1001073101_36"]="Let's get to the point. What happened while I was out?",
  ["1001073101_37"]="Good news and bad news.",
  ["1001073101_38"]="Good news is, your puppet diversion worked like a charm.",
  ["1001073101_39"]="The C.A.V.E. guys took the bait and went the wrong way... It'll take them a while to figure out where we are now.",
  ["1001073101_4"]="Zero's gaze fixes on Wushi, the tense atmosphere palpable even from a distance.",
  ["1001073101_40"]="And the bad?",
  ["1001073101_41"]="Well, those puppets not only attracted the C.A.V.E. guys, but also the brother of your VIP guest.",
  ["1001073101_42"]="Not a big deal. That's why I've set up enough decoys in all directions to keep him occupied for a while.",
  ["1001073101_43"]="Well, here's the bad news: her brother went wild and wrecked all the puppets you left behind.",
  ["1001073101_44"]="What did you say?",
  ["1001073101_45"]="Even worse, he's ditched all distractions and is speeding our way. He'll be here in less than ten minutes, I'm afraid.",
  ["1001073101_46"]="That wasn't part of your original plan, was it?",
  ["1001073101_47"]="Hongxian appears unsurprised, simply blinking.",
  ["1001073101_48"]="Doesn't matter... Just a bit faster than expected.",
  ["1001073101_49"]="In that case, let's kick off the climax early... Get ready for a showdown, my little mercenary.",
  ["1001073101_5"]="However, I vaguely sense that Wushi means no harm this time.",
  ["1001073101_50"]="Huh? Seriously?",
  ["1001073101_51"]="Have you forgotten the contract we signed? My role is to set up the venue, prepare the manpower, and capture the girl without alerting WeiShi...",
  ["1001073101_52"]="We never agreed I'd be dealing with a mysterious masked man tossing flying daggers!",
  ["1001073101_53"]="What's with all the fuss? It's not like you're new to this mercenary gig.",
  ["1001073101_54"]="Let me get this straight. WeiShi has locked down almost all the entrances and exits of CangLin City, and I'm the only one who knows a few hidden passages.",
  ["1001073101_55"]="So, if you don't want to end up behind bars, you better stick to the plan and play it straight!",
  ["1001073101_56"]="Carmine smirks, meeting Hongxian's gaze directly.",
  ["1001073101_57"]="Heh, you've got me wrong. I'm not planning to bail out halfway through.",
  ["1001073101_58"]="I mean, this Wushi guy is a tough nut to crack. If you want me to handle him, you'll have to...",
  ["1001073101_59"]="Pay. More.",
  ["1001073101_61"]="Immediately after Wushi departs, Xin follows in a stride, pursuing him through the streets and alleys.",
  ["1001073101_62"]="By the time we caught up, all we saw was Xin's frustrated expression.",
  ["1001073101_63"]="Sorry, lost him.",
  ["1001073101_64"]="I was close to catching him, but just as I was about to strike, some puppets halted me in my tracks.",
  ["1001073101_65"]="By the time I dealt with those dummies... he was nowhere to be seen.",
  ["1001073101_66"]="Venting her frustration, Xin ruthlessly kicks one of the puppets lying on the ground.",
  ["1001073101_67"]="*Crunch*",
  ["1001073101_68"]="Wait... why did this scrap come back to life?!",
  ["1001073101_69"]="Perhaps due to the sudden external force, the dormant puppet starts convulsing once more.",
  ["1001073101_7"]="You're welcome.",
  ["1001073101_70"]="...",
  ["1001073101_71"]="Hold on. Please, don't harm it.",
  ["1001073101_72"]="This little one... isn't a threat anymore.",
  ["1001073101_73"]="Following Yuli's gaze, I notice that the puppet's limbs and joints have been broken in the previous battle. At present, it is struggling to extend its arms as if driven by instinct.",
  ["1001073101_74"]="Rather than a monster struggling for survival, it resembles more a confused and helpless child.",
  ["1001073101_75"]="Where's my brother...? I... I can't see anything... It's so dark...",
  ["1001073101_76"]="I-I'm scared... Don't leave me alone...",
  ["1001073101_77"]="No worries... I'm here with you.",
  ["1001073101_78"]="The young puppetmaster sets aside the strings in her hand, embracing the fragile figure in her arms.",
  ["1001073101_79"]="All I remember is... I've been trekking from the Western Region to CangLin City... for what seems like an eternity...",
  ["1001073101_8"]="...",
  ["1001073101_80"]="My body's gotten weary, but I can't see... the end of my journey...",
  ["1001073101_81"]="Let's rest here. We're... back home.",
  ["1001073101_82"]="You... you're not my brother. Still... thank you...",
  ["1001073101_83"]="The final sound before the gears cease spinning is crystal clear.",
  ["1001073101_84"]="The puppet leans forward slightly, then comes to a complete halt as if sleeping in peace.",
  ["1001073101_85"]="Its final expression resembles a heartfelt smile without any regrets.",
  ["1001073101_87"]="...You've probably realized it, right?",
  ["1001073101_88"]="Puppets are driven by memories. They mimic and replay their memories, reliving the emotions embedded within them.",
  ["1001073101_89"]="Take this puppet, for example... It believe it was the girl named \"Tiaohua\" until the very moment its gears stopped.",
  ["1001073101_9"]="I've settled the debt I owed you at Mr. Nong's place.",
  ["1001073101_90"]="So, I wish for this little one to depart without suffering. It's the final act of kindness I can offer as a puppetmaster.",
  ["1001073101_91"]="No wonder those puppets looked so expressive when they saw me...",
  ["1001073101_92"]="Is this how you puppetmasters bring them to life?",
  ["1001073101_93"]="Yuli offers no explanation, only shaking her head.",
  ["1001073101_94"]="To puppets, puppetmasters are merely memory sculptors.",
  ["1001073101_95"]="Newborn puppets are like infants. They can't recognize colors, languages, or emotions... They act only when the puppetmaster pulls the strings.",
  ["1001073101_96"]="Yet, they're not lifeless objects—each tug weaves a unique memory into them.",
  ["1001073101_97"]="Gradual changes lead to evolution. As memories accumulate, puppets start to understand actions, eventually discovering their true selves, like Sue did.",
  ["1001073101_98"]="A hint of sorrow crosses Yuli's face as she speaks.",
  ["1001073101_99"]="But Hongxian... rather than guiding puppets, she prefers to dominate them.",
  ["1001073201_1"]="Thank you for the intelligence, Head Librarian.",
  ["1001073201_10"]="Despite the risks of encountering those contaminated animals, they seem to be making a desperate move... Typical Nemesis.",
  ["1001073201_12"]="Exactly. If they're gearing up for a desperate struggle, we'll have them cornered.",
  ["1001073201_13"]="I've sent you their location. Follow this highway straight ahead, and you should be able to pick up their trail.",
  ["1001073201_15"]="Once again, thank you for your invaluable assistance. WeiShi... no, the entire CangLin City will grant you our support.",
  ["1001073201_16"]="I've rallied all the nearby personnel to encircle them. We're aiming to block off every possible escape route they might have.",
  ["1001073201_17"]="Just as I prepared to put away the communicator, another voice suddenly reaches my ears.",
  ["1001073201_18"]="Hold up, don't hang up just yet.",
  ["1001073201_19"]="Pass me the communicator. I've got a few questions for her.",
  ["1001073201_2"]="We've got Nemesis' movements on lock now, and we've blocked the exits and started thorough inspections. We might not be able to completely stop the puppet infiltration right away, but we can definitely slow them down a bit.",
  ["1001073201_21"]="Thanks.",
  ["1001073201_22"]="Having anticipated my action, Xin swiftly snatches the communicator before I can press the button.",
  ["1001073201_23"]="...",
  ["1001073201_24"]="Don't play dumb, Qing. You know what I'm about to ask.",
  ["1001073201_25"]="I... I do owe you an apology for what happened to Tiaohua. Once this is over, I'll give you a proper explanation.",
  ["1001073201_26"]="In contrast to her usual decisive tone, her voice carries a rare tinge of hesitation.",
  ["1001073201_27"]="You are a pure soul, Xin. If you had known the truth about Tiaohua's disappearance, you would've pursued it relentlessly no matter what, but Tiaohua...",
  ["1001073201_28"]="She's tangled up in a web of conspiracies involving multiple factions: Nemesis, Wushi, and other forces eyeing the Cerulean Water... The slightest misstep could drag you into danger.",
  ["1001073201_29"]="Many of our colleagues are out of contact, their fate uncertain, all because of my mistakes... If you end up like them, I...",
  ["1001073201_3"]="Now, about Wushi...",
  ["1001073201_30"]="That's what annoys me the most.",
  ["1001073201_31"]="If you didn't spill the beans because of some confidentiality rules, I wouldn't have batted an eye.",
  ["1001073201_32"]="But saying you feared I'd act recklessly... What's that supposed to mean? Am I just a dumb girl in your eyes who can never do things right?",
  ["1001073201_33"]="...",
  ["1001073201_34"]="I admit, I've made many stupid mistakes, but I'm also part of WeiShi! I understand the importance of certain matters and our priorities!",
  ["1001073201_35"]="Just like how you taught me to trust others, I just hope you can do the same for me, too.",
  ["1001073201_36"]="Xin...",
  ["1001073201_37"]="Xin cuts in before Qing can say anything.",
  ["1001073201_38"]="Alright, I've said my piece, I'm done being angry. Let's leave it at that.",
  ["1001073201_39"]="And save your apologies. If you really feel bad, take me out to eat after this, and we'll be square.",
  ["1001073201_4"]="The voice on the other end of the line stutters slightly.",
  ["1001073201_40"]="As for now...",
  ["1001073201_41"]="Xin ends the call, drawing her weapon and tossing the communicator to my hand.",
  ["1001073201_42"]="It's time for those sneaky rats to get their beating.",
  ["1001073201_43"]="Are they thinking of making a run for it through there?!",
  ["1001073201_45"]="Then we can't afford to lose the upper hand here.",
  ["1001073201_47"]="Leave it to us.",
  ["1001073201_48"]="We won't let them slip away.",
  ["1001073201_49"]="(Pass the communicator to Xin.)",
  ["1001073201_5"]="If what he said is true about being able to tell real from fake Tiaohua, then his next move could be a crucial piece of the puzzle.",
  ["1001073201_50"]="(Hang up.)",
  ["1001073201_51"]="Confrontation",
  ["1001073201_6"]="According to the public surveillance system of the Bureau of Civil Security, Wushi's path seems to be closely following a truck that's gone off its planned route, both heading towards a secluded highway branching off from the main road.",
  ["1001073201_7"]="To add to the complexity, that highway cuts through the hydroponic farming area, where a lot of farm animals affected by the Cerulean Blight are residing.",
  ["1001073201_9"]="Yes, due to those contaminated farm animals, our security forces haven't been able to secure that remote area completely.",
  ["1001073202_1"]="With each step forward, the uneasiness in my heart intensifies.",
  ["1001073202_10"]="So, before I draw my daggers, I'll give you one last warning.",
  ["1001073202_11"]="Out of my way!",
  ["1001073202_13"]="You're talking about Tiaohua's immortality, right?",
  ["1001073202_14"]="I found out about it from the WeiShi database.",
  ["1001073202_15"]="And you still have the nerve to face Tiaohua?",
  ["1001073202_16"]="...",
  ["1001073202_17"]="Well, take this water and give it to her.",
  ["1001073202_18"]="This all started with me, and I have to finish... what I started.",
  ["1001073202_19"]="Besides, I never intend to hand my sister in the first place.",
  ["1001073202_2"]="The roadside is scattered with fallen farm animals, damaged puppets, and scorched tire marks on the asphalt.",
  ["1001073202_20"]="In your eyes, Tiaohua is no longer an innocent girl, but rather an \"anomaly\" with the secrets of immortality that need monitoring and sealed away.",
  ["1001073202_21"]="In that light, you're no different from Nemesis...",
  ["1001073202_22"]="I don't want her stuck in your gilded cage for eternity.",
  ["1001073202_23"]="What are you even saying...? Don't lump us in with those lunatics.",
  ["1001073202_24"]="If that's Qing's plan, she'll have to deal with me first!",
  ["1001073202_25"]="But how can you ensure that others are as righteous as you and won't harbor any desire for immortality?",
  ["1001073202_26"]="Eternal life, since ancient times, countless have ultimately sought but never to obtain. Today, it may be just Nemesis drives you on the run... but among those who seeking immortality, many of the most powerful and malevolent will always exist.",
  ["1001073202_27"]="When that day come, how will you protect Tiaohua from those grasping hands?",
  ["1001073202_28"]="...",
  ["1001073202_29"]="Just as Xin hesitates, Yuli's voice emanates from the string.",
  ["1001073202_3"]="At the end of the road, that familiar dark figure appears once again.",
  ["1001073202_30"]="Please stay there, Xin. Don't get any closer.",
  ["1001073202_31"]="The girl he's carrying is not your friend at all.",
  ["1001073202_32"]="Only then do I realize that since Wushi's appearance, Yuli has steadfastly kept her gaze fixed behind him.",
  ["1001073202_33"]="If this is your way of trying to get me to hand over Tiaohua...",
  ["1001073202_34"]="Your little trick is pathetically crude.",
  ["1001073202_35"]="As Wushi steps forward, a surge of murderous intent emerges in his once-calm eyes.",
  ["1001073202_36"]="This is not a persuasion, it's a warning",
  ["1001073202_37"]="The thing on your back... will kill you.",
  ["1001073202_38"]="Ha.",
  ["1001073202_39"]="A sense of familiar unease quietly creeps down my spine.",
  ["1001073202_4"]="Tiaohua on his back remains ominously silent, her face as pallid as a withering white flower.",
  ["1001073202_40"]="In a trance, I feel as if seeing that pair of malevolent, crimson eyes once again.",
  ["1001073202_41"]="We can't wait any longer, Yuli.",
  ["1001073202_42"]="I see.",
  ["1001073202_43"]="...!",
  ["1001073202_44"]="In the next moment, a rapid flash of metal clashing fills my vision.",
  ["1001073202_45"]="The duel between Yuli and Wushi lacks intensity, with only a few exchanges leaving the latter visibly fatigued.",
  ["1001073202_46"]="The days of pursuit and the car accident have taken a toll on Wushi's body.",
  ["1001073202_47"]="Yuli can distinctly feel that with each clash, the force coming to her strings diminishes slightly.",
  ["1001073202_48"]="Eventually, the sharp dagger has reached its limit.",
  ["1001073202_49"]="The results are evident.",
  ["1001073202_5"]="...",
  ["1001073202_50"]="Amidst a chilling hum, Wushi senses a sudden lightness in his back as Tiaohua's slender figure falls to the ground as if pulled by a string.",
  ["1001073202_51"]="With just a flick of the fingertips, Sue can easily pierce the ominous shadow lurking behind Wushi.",
  ["1001073202_52"]="However, the humanoid puppet, along with its smooth movements, abruptly halts at this moment.",
  ["1001073202_53"]="Don't hold back, Yuli.",
  ["1001073202_54"]="No, this won't do.",
  ["1001073202_55"]="He's shielding that puppet with his body. If I retract my strings now... he'll die too.",
  ["1001073202_56"]="...",
  ["1001073202_57"]="Spare me your thoughts.",
  ["1001073202_58"]="I don't need your pity.",
  ["1001073202_59"]="Noticing this brief pause, Wushi swiftly strikes back, wielding his dagger to intercept the strings encircling him.",
  ["1001073202_6"]="You're Tiaohua's brother. I don't want to fight you.",
  ["1001073202_60"]="At that instant, the metallic hum that filled the air fades away.",
  ["1001073202_61"]="Oh no... these threads won't pull back.",
  ["1001073202_62"]="...",
  ["1001073202_63"]="Once the strings cease flowing, they'll only become a static net that restrains the puppetmaster.",
  ["1001073202_64"]="The outcome of this battle becomes clear when the circumstances are reversed.",
  ["1001073202_65"]="Holding onto his dagger's hilt, Wushi makes a direct slash towards the puppetmaster.",
  ["1001073202_66"]="To sever the strings and get Tiaohua back.",
  ["1001073202_67"]="What?!",
  ["1001073202_68"]="However, as his dagger descends, the direction of the strings unexpectedly reverses.",
  ["1001073202_69"]="Almost as if acting on its own will, the massive puppet breaks loose from the strings, advancing towards Wushi like a specter.",
  ["1001073202_7"]="Put her down... She's badly hurt and needs treatment now.",
  ["1001073202_70"]="Sue?",
  ["1001073202_71"]="For a puppetmaster, their strings are like their mind and soul.",
  ["1001073202_72"]="Once the strings are out, there's no need for hesitation.",
  ["1001073202_73"]="The threads still connect Yuli and Sue, but this time the puppet seems to be in control.",
  ["1001073202_74"]="At that moment, Yuli appears to relinquish control of her own body.",
  ["1001073202_75"]="Following the guidance of the strings, she moves almost instinctively, directing the puppet towards the shadow behind Wushi and delivering a fatal blow.",
  ["1001073202_76"]="Tiaohua's body collapses to the ground like a wilting flower.",
  ["1001073202_77"]="At that instant, all noises—whether Wushi's cries, Xin's steps, or the clashing of weapons—suddenly fall silent.",
  ["1001073202_78"]="Tick.",
  ["1001073202_79"]="Silence reigns.",
  ["1001073202_8"]="Instead of slowing down, Wushi reveals a hint of ruthlessness in his tone.",
  ["1001073202_80"]="Tick, tick.",
  ["1001073202_81"]="The sole sound discernible is...",
  ["1001073202_82"]="Tick, tick, tick.",
  ["1001073202_83"]="The rhythmic thud of someone's heartbeat.",
  ["1001073202_84"]="However, the sound is too steady and mechanical, resembling not a heartbeat but rather the ticking of a second hand.",
  ["1001073202_85"]="Ahh, looks like I've messed up...",
  ["1001073202_86"]="No crimson blood flows from the \"wound\" on Tiaohua's chest.",
  ["1001073202_87"]="Like a clockwork puppet, the critically injured \"Tiaohua\" slowly stands up.",
  ["1001073202_88"]="Thought I'd enjoy an intense showdown, all pumped up and everything.",
  ["1001073202_89"]="But it ended without a drop of blood... How utterly disappointing.",
  ["1001073202_9"]="You're her friend. I don't want to hurt you either.",
  ["1001073202_90"]="Tiao... hua?",
  ["1001073202_91"]="Wushi's gaze is filled with despair.",
  ["1001073202_92"]="Before him stands the familiar girl speaking in a manner he recognizes all too well.",
  ["1001073202_93"]="Yet, her appearance emanates an unfamiliar coldness.",
  ["1001073202_94"]="Hey, why the shocked?",
  ["1001073202_95"]="Weren't you searching for me, my dear \"brother\"?",
  ["1001073202_97"]="Tiaohua's situation is complex.",
  ["1001073202_98"]="You can't handle this alone.",
  ["1001073202_99"]="The results are evident.",
  ["1001073301_1"]="The puppet is a mere three steps away from Wushi.",
  ["1001073301_10"]="Teehee! You want me to stop? Well, I won't!",
  ["1001073301_11"]="Let me guess... You could strike decisively before because the small puppets I released were merely crude imitations of familiar faces—not meant for close inspection.",
  ["1001073301_12"]="But the puppet before you is different. Her figure, appearance, voice, even the look in her eyes when rescued—everything mirrors your closest loved one exactly as you remember.",
  ["1001073301_13"]="That's why... you can't bring yourself to harm her.",
  ["1001073301_14"]="Enough!",
  ["1001073301_15"]="With his roar, several cold gleams streak by.",
  ["1001073301_16"]="However, the response he receives is the sound of iron clashing against threads.",
  ["1001073301_17"]="Amidst the dark red threads, the girl across from him discards her facade, revealing her true self with a mocking grin.",
  ["1001073301_18"]="Because you're starting to realize that those characteristics you used to distinguish your sister from the puppets are actually quite vague.",
  ["1001073301_19"]="The lingering smell of hospital disinfectant from a long stay, the leg issue from the trek from the Western Region, and the habit of speaking with her head down due to limited interaction...",
  ["1001073301_2"]="At this close range, even through instinct alone, Wushi could easily reap the foe before him.",
  ["1001073301_20"]="All those traits you thought were unique to Tiaohua can actually be copied.",
  ["1001073301_21"]="That's why you're feeling afraid... Oh, you're so scared.",
  ["1001073301_22"]="Because...",
  ["1001073301_23"]="You've taken a puppet that looks, talks, and behaves like her... as your beloved kin!",
  ["1001073301_24"]="So, from the start, Tiaohua has...",
  ["1001073301_25"]="Exactly! Thanks to your recklessness, we've attracted the entire city's attention here.",
  ["1001073301_26"]="Those WeiShi folks are sharp. Puppets resembling Tiaohua alone won't fool them.",
  ["1001073301_27"]="But add an anxious brother to the mix? Voila!",
  ["1001073301_28"]="Wushi's pupils suddenly contract.",
  ["1001073301_29"]="Unseen threads have subtly entwined since he cleaved the initial puppet, tightening beyond his recognition...",
  ["1001073301_3"]="...",
  ["1001073301_30"]="All due to his fixation on his closest family member.",
  ["1001073301_31"]="But hey, don't blame yourself. Human memory is unreliable, you know?",
  ["1001073301_32"]="All it takes is a subtle nudge, a seemingly unique hint, and you'll rush toward it like moths to a flame.",
  ["1001073301_33"]="And for us puppetmasters... that's the art of manipulation.",
  ["1001073301_34"]="Enough.",
  ["1001073301_35"]="An icy voice interrupts Hongxian's monologue.",
  ["1001073301_36"]="You don't deserve the title of a puppetmaster, Hongxian.",
  ["1001073301_37"]="Puppetry was never meant for manipulating people or sowing hatred.",
  ["1001073301_38"]="Hongxian makes a casual gesture, donning the same sardonic grin.",
  ["1001073301_39"]="Aha, that familiar arrogance. So typical of you.",
  ["1001073301_4"]="Yet, it is this proximity that offers a clear view of the figure standing before him.",
  ["1001073301_40"]="...Don't act like you know me well.",
  ["1001073301_41"]="Let me repeat. I've never met you before, and I want no association with someone like you.",
  ["1001073301_42"]="Hmm, that hurts, you know?",
  ["1001073301_43"]="If I'm just a complete stranger, why the hostility?",
  ["1001073301_44"]="A Nemesis member, a rogue puppetmaster, and a deceitful villain... but in the end, you learned everything about me from others, right?",
  ["1001073301_45"]="Hongxian's words are met with ruthless silver strings.",
  ["1001073301_46"]="Save your breath.",
  ["1001073301_47"]="What's happened today is enough to make you my enemy.",
  ["1001073301_48"]="Ahh, how pathetic. Looks like Sue didn't spill the beans in the end.",
  ["1001073301_49"]="...",
  ["1001073301_5"]="Despite the tightening grip on the hilt, he hesitates to throw his dagger.",
  ["1001073301_50"]="Sue?",
  ["1001073301_51"]="Hah, gotcha!",
  ["1001073301_52"]="Seizing Yuli's moment of hesitation, Hongxian's expression turns grim.",
  ["1001073301_53"]="Like scissors cutting through paper, a crimson hue slices through the scene before her, poised to sever Yuli's strings.",
  ["1001073301_54"]="Enough.",
  ["1001073301_55"]="However, the guardian puppet stands firm like an unyielding barrier, deflecting all incoming attacks.",
  ["1001073301_56"]="Your tricks won't work on Sue.",
  ["1001073301_57"]="Hmph, you're just a puppet following orders. What's there to be so arrogant about?",
  ["1001073301_58"]="Next time, I'll set up a stage tailored just for you. As for this situation...",
  ["1001073301_59"]="I'll have \"her\" handle it.",
  ["1001073301_6"]="Those puppets looked just like your sister, but you swiftly destroyed them all, didn't you?",
  ["1001073301_60"]="Don't think you can run away... Huh?!",
  ["1001073301_61"]="Before Xin can react, a carmine figure swiftly moves, blocking her path.",
  ["1001073301_62"]="It becomes evident that the atmosphere has grown eerily silent for some time now.",
  ["1001073301_63"]="All the sounds heard on the way there, from the creatures' calls to the caravan's engines, have inexplicably vanished.",
  ["1001073301_64"]="In their place, a sequence of enraged footsteps echo.",
  ["1001073301_65"]="Two Eme-an, a girl wielding a lance, and a puppetmaster lugging a piece of wood.",
  ["1001073301_66"]="Wasn't it agreed we'd only deal with the knife-throwing guy? Where did these extras suddenly come from?!",
  ["1001073301_67"]="Relax. Since I'm assigning you this urgent task, you'll naturally get your fair share of the payment.",
  ["1001073301_68"]="Didn't Magnifico fill you in? Once everything's done, my share of the payment will be all yours.",
  ["1001073301_69"]="Really? Like... for real?",
  ["1001073301_7"]="Why the hesitation now?",
  ["1001073301_70"]="Oh, come on... Have I ever lied to you before?",
  ["1001073301_71"]="Upon Hongxian's reassurance, the vexation that clouded Carmine's face instantly dissipates.",
  ["1001073301_72"]="What follows is a starkly brutal display of violence, unsettling in its bluntness.",
  ["1001073301_73"]="Ohhh! Why didn't you just said so?",
  ["1001073301_74"]="Since the extra payment is in, from now on...",
  ["1001073301_75"]="Your enemies are my enemies, Your Ladyship.",
  ["1001073301_76"]="Solitary Stage",
  ["1001073301_8"]="Stop mimicking Tiaohua's voice...",
  ["1001073301_9"]="His words only provoke a louder chuckle from the puppet.",
  ["1001073302_1"]="The confrontation between the strings and the sword unfolds with heightened intensity.",
  ["1001073302_10"]="Yet, she is met with intense pain induced by Xin's lance.",
  ["1001073302_11"]="Just give up already.",
  ["1001073302_12"]="Your reddish partner ran off ages ago.",
  ["1001073302_13"]="Tsk, crafty bastard... I just knew it would end up like this.",
  ["1001073302_14"]="A glint of resolve flickers in Carmine's eyes as she raises her sword above her head, resembling a beast poised for one final desperate struggle.",
  ["1001073302_15"]="Overwhelmed by the scarlet radiance, even Xin involuntarily steps back.",
  ["1001073302_16"]="Huh? Still trying to lunge at us now?!",
  ["1001073302_17"]="However, Carmine loosens her grip in the next moment.",
  ["1001073302_18"]="With a muffled sound, the sword slips from her grasp.",
  ["1001073302_19"]="Alright, no more fighting.",
  ["1001073302_2"]="The long sword in Carmine's hand resembles a scarlet storm sweeping the battlefield.",
  ["1001073302_20"]="I surrender. You've won.",
  ["1001073302_21"]="A-are you kidding me?!",
  ["1001073302_22"]="Surrendering won't cut it. Grab your sword and face me!",
  ["1001073302_23"]="You've caused so much harm! Do you think a simple \"I surrender\" will absolve you?!",
  ["1001073302_24"]="Hey, I'm not the real culprit here, you know?",
  ["1001073302_25"]="If you're truly after justice, go find that puppetmaster.",
  ["1001073302_26"]="Me? I'm just a hired hand. Offing me won't do you any good.",
  ["1001073302_27"]="You...",
  ["1001073302_28"]="Please calm down, Miss Xin. Let's handcuff her first.",
  ["1001073302_29"]="Secretary Qing will decide what happens next.",
  ["1001073302_3"]="Despite standing at the eye of the storm, the young puppetmaster displays no hint of fear.",
  ["1001073302_30"]="You're right... I won't waste my breath on this jerk.",
  ["1001073302_31"]="Stay there! Keep your hands still!",
  ["1001073302_32"]="This is... weird... Why are my hands... shaking?",
  ["1001073302_33"]="P-payment... not enough... I must... sever... kill!",
  ["1001073302_34"]="Just as the handcuffs are about to restrain Carmine's wrists, she starts convulsing violently, her previously casual expression twisting into a wry smile.",
  ["1001073302_35"]="Without warning, she suddenly wields the weapon, thrusting towards the nearby Xin as if her body is controlled by an unseen force.",
  ["1001073302_36"]="...!",
  ["1001073302_37"]="Stay still, Xin.",
  ["1001073302_38"]="Almost instantly, Yuli makes her move. Guided by her strings, Sue lunges at Carmine like a leaf in a gust of wind.",
  ["1001073302_39"]="Carmine arcs through the air, crashing heavily to the ground.",
  ["1001073302_4"]="As if she is crafting an intricate design with remarkable precision and speed.",
  ["1001073302_40"]="Darn it! What the heck is wrong...",
  ["1001073302_41"]="Trailing Xin's gaze, I see Carmine's body contorted in an unusual posture.",
  ["1001073302_42"]="\"Her\" head tilts, lips still bearing that eerie smile with a derisive touch.",
  ["1001073302_43"]="From her mouth emits lifeless, mechanical creaks unique to puppets.",
  ["1001073302_5"]="Gradually, the meandering silver hue tightens, the sharp sound of the sword slicing through the air fading away.",
  ["1001073302_6"]="When Carmine finally realizes her situation, the sword in her grasp has become unbearably weighty.",
  ["1001073302_7"]="The results are evident.",
  ["1001073302_8"]="Hongxian...? Hongxian!",
  ["1001073302_9"]="Quit fooling around and cut those strings!",
  ["1001073401_1"]="Several days later, inside WeiShi.",
  ["1001073401_10"]="Qing adjusts her glasses and glances towards Azi.",
  ["1001073401_101"]="Delphic Oracle is a member of our alliance located in Delphi Academy. Due to intricate historical reasons, they hold the most anomalies and Beacons within the alliance.",
  ["1001073401_102"]="Unlike other organizations that take a conservative approach to anomalies, they use radical methods to explore, analyze, and even apply usage to those anomalies rather than sealing them away.",
  ["1001073401_103"]="Of course, as long as it doesn't disrupt the mundane world.",
  ["1001073401_104"]="While many in the alliance frown upon their approach, Delphic Oracle is undeniably a leading authority figure in anomaly research.",
  ["1001073401_105"]="Remember General Sarvis from the Library? He founded the Florentine family.",
  ["1001073401_106"]="His lineage has been overseeing Japheth's history for generations. Compared to other organizations, they're more well-tuned in resolving issues through political intrigue and diplomacy, and they wield significant influence in the world's banking industry.",
  ["1001073401_107"]="Division Zero is a covert organization in Cyril with matchless intelligence capabilities. If you need someone to track down Nemesis, they're the best choice.",
  ["1001073401_108"]="Despite belonging to the C.A.V.E. in name, Division Zero is an intelligence department of Cyril... Its nature makes it completely different from Eme-an or WeiShi.",
  ["1001073401_109"]="Because of this, the relationship between Division Zero and other C.A.V.E. organizations has been... delicate. I wouldn't advise direct contact with them.",
  ["1001073401_11"]="How's it going with dealing with the puppets on your end, Azi? Need more hands on deck?",
  ["1001073401_111"]="...",
  ["1001073401_112"]="Just as I ponder my next move, a knock sounds at the door.",
  ["1001073401_113"]="I'm sorry for bothering you at a time like this, Head Librarian.",
  ["1001073401_115"]="I believe I owe you an explanation for what's happened...",
  ["1001073401_116"]="I came to CangLin City precisely to stop Hongxian and her puppets, and to limit the incident's impact to be as minimal as possible.",
  ["1001073401_117"]="But because of my oversight, I inadvertently involved you and many citizens... putting you in danger multiple times...",
  ["1001073401_119"]="That was too close... Hongxian was almost able to access your memories.",
  ["1001073401_12"]="Not at all. Everything is going smoothly on my end.",
  ["1001073401_120"]="Yes... Sue said the same thing.",
  ["1001073401_121"]="So... to prevent such incidents in the future, I've prepared something for you.",
  ["1001073401_122"]="With that, Yuli carefully passes a doll-sized puppet into my hands.",
  ["1001073401_123"]="While the materials used are far from extravagant, they exude a unique simplicity and elegance, embodying the creator's dedication and skills in the meticulous stitches and distinctive cuts.",
  ["1001073401_124"]="This is the \"gift\" I promised back in QingYu City.",
  ["1001073401_125"]="Anything that conveys my feelings would be perfect; that's what you said.",
  ["1001073401_126"]="For us puppetmasters, threads are like our lifeblood. I personally selected all the materials for this doll, from the strings to the fabric. I really hope you like it...",
  ["1001073401_128"]="Hehe... as long as you like it...",
  ["1001073401_129"]="Great. That's a relief. One important task checked off the list.",
  ["1001073401_13"]="With little Yuli's help, clearing out these hidden puppets is a breeze!",
  ["1001073401_130"]="You might not know this, Head Librarian, but creating this little one took Yuli days and nights of meticulous needlework.",
  ["1001073401_131"]="Every stitch she made, she'd ask, \"Will the Head Librarian like this color?\" or \"What do you think of this pattern?\" It was nerve-wracking, to be honest.",
  ["1001073401_132"]="...Sue!",
  ["1001073401_134"]="Yes, this little one is no ordinary doll.",
  ["1001073401_135"]="Sue snipped off some of Hongxian's hair during that battle, and I used those strands as some threads for this doll.",
  ["1001073401_136"]="Just like leaves and branches are extensions of trees, for us puppetmasters, our hair is seen as an extension of ourselves.",
  ["1001073401_137"]="If Hongxian ever reappears, this little one will be the first to warn you, protecting you from her disguises.",
  ["1001073401_138"]="However, there's one thing I'd like you to pay special attention to...",
  ["1001073401_139"]="Yuli's eyes flickers momentarily as she speaks of this.",
  ["1001073401_14"]="We just followed the strings she left behind and easily uncovered all those puppets. Soon, we'll rid the city of those Nemesis infiltrators.",
  ["1001073401_141"]="Please... take good care of her during your journey.",
  ["1001073401_142"]="Even a puppet... can feel lonely.",
  ["1001073401_143"]="If possible, please spend some time with her, have a little chat every couple of days.",
  ["1001073401_145"]="Anything would do.",
  ["1001073401_146"]="Share your travel stories, the sights you encounter, or even just the everyday things in your life... As long as it's about your life, she'll be all ears.",
  ["1001073401_148"]="Thank you.",
  ["1001073401_149"]="Oh, and there's one more thing I've got for you.",
  ["1001073401_15"]="But it's a bit disappointing... I was planning to treat little Yuli to a celebratory meal, but as before, she vanished before I could invite her.",
  ["1001073401_150"]="Her tone becomes more serious.",
  ["1001073401_151"]="After casting a quick glance around to ensure no outsiders are present, she retrieves a letter from Sue's hidden compartment.",
  ["1001073401_152"]="Master Yuanquan instructed me to pass this letter to you in a secure place.",
  ["1001073401_153"]="Please... take good care of it.",
  ["1001073401_154"]="The letter bears an ornate frame. Although I've never seen such a letter before, the emblem on it emits an unexpected air of familiarity.",
  ["1001073401_155"]="Is this... the crest of the Florentine family?",
  ["1001073401_156"]="...",
  ["1001073401_158"]="We can't stay here forever.",
  ["1001073401_159"]="We need to find a way to... save everyone at the Tower of Babel.",
  ["1001073401_16"]="That is fine. She has her own consideration as a puppetmaster, and we shouldn't meddle.",
  ["1001073401_160"]="Perhaps by then...",
  ["1001073401_161"]="Can we reach out to other organizations for help?",
  ["1001073401_162"]="Tell me more about Delphic Oracle.",
  ["1001073401_163"]="I need more details about the Florentine family.",
  ["1001073401_164"]="What exactly is Division Zero?",
  ["1001073401_165"]="I'm pretty familiar with all of them.",
  ["1001073401_166"]="What's the matter?",
  ["1001073401_168"]="Danger? I never felt it.",
  ["1001073401_169"]="Let's look ahead instead of dwelling on the past.",
  ["1001073401_17"]="She came to CangLin City for that Nemesis puppetmaster... Now that Hongxian has left, she has no reason to stay any longer.",
  ["1001073401_170"]="It's pretty impressive.",
  ["1001073401_171"]="It's so unique.",
  ["1001073401_172"]="But, this doll...",
  ["1001073401_173"]="It's more than just an ordinary doll, right?",
  ["1001073401_174"]="What is it?",
  ["1001073401_176"]="What should we talk about?",
  ["1001073401_178"]="Absolutely, I promise.",
  ["1001073401_179"]="Then I'll consider her my doll companion.",
  ["1001073401_18"]="Besides... now is not the time to let our guard down.",
  ["1001073401_180"]="Silent Finale",
  ["1001073401_19"]="A touch of gravity crosses Qing's expression.",
  ["1001073401_2"]="Qing, we've found those missing individuals. They were locked up in a medicine warehouse.",
  ["1001073401_20"]="This Nemesis infiltration was on an unprecedented scale. Judging by their secrecy and speed of their method make this is one of the most severe incidents CangLin City has faced recently, second to the Cerulean Blight.",
  ["1001073401_21"]="Thanks to everyone's swift response and teamwork, along with the Head Librarian's dedicated help, we've managed to minimize the damage.",
  ["1001073401_22"]="But let's not forget... Tiaohua is still in their hands.",
  ["1001073401_23"]="...",
  ["1001073401_24"]="They stay hidden for decades and caused quite a commotion upon their sudden return.",
  ["1001073401_25"]="If you ask me, those Nemesis members are... surprisingly patient.",
  ["1001073401_26"]="C.A.V.E. and Nemesis are two sides of the same coin. While we carefully oversee human history, they stir it within the shadow.",
  ["1001073401_27"]="Their ambitions and fixation on anomalies seem only to deepen over time, hidden from our view.",
  ["1001073401_28"]="I have a feeling that this incident is just the beginning. Nemesis... won't stop here.",
  ["1001073401_29"]="What about Tiaohua's brother? Any news on him?",
  ["1001073401_3"]="If we include those we found in the East Street warehouse yesterday... we've accounted for all the missing WeiShi members and citizens.",
  ["1001073401_30"]="Unfortunately, no. Despite our efforts to find him, he remains elusive.",
  ["1001073401_31"]="But there's one thing for certain... Once he learned Tiaohua had been taken out of the city, he also vanished without a trace.",
  ["1001073401_32"]="Nevertheless, our focus should be on the whereabouts of Nemesis.",
  ["1001073401_33"]="According to the information we gathered about their movements, they started their operation soon after you deactivated the Beacon.",
  ["1001073401_34"]="Meanwhile, downstream of the Fertile Plains.",
  ["1001073401_35"]="Quietly, an unassuming ship is making its way along the final currents of the Grandeur River towards the Boundless Ocean.",
  ["1001073401_36"]="Heh, I didn't expect the officials at the Bureau of Roads & Travel to be so accommodating... A front for offshore fishery is all it took.",
  ["1001073401_37"]="Because Magnifico has handled everything.",
  ["1001073401_38"]="Let's keep moving east. For safety, we shouldn't stop until we reach the ship picking us up.",
  ["1001073401_39"]="How intriguing. It's rare to see you so cautious. What? WeiShi got you rattled?",
  ["1001073401_4"]="How are they doing physically? Any unusual symptoms?",
  ["1001073401_40"]="Not WeiShi, but you. I should be extra careful when working with a lunatic like you, or it could cost more than a few lives.",
  ["1001073401_41"]="By the way, where's the puppet you created using my memories? You've gotten rid of it, right?",
  ["1001073401_42"]="I leave no traces. That puppet of yours? I got rid of it through the hands of WeiShi.",
  ["1001073401_43"]="Or would you rather have a clone who looks just like you and talks in your voice wandering around?",
  ["1001073401_44"]="Nah, I'm just worried you might misuse that puppet, like... creating some kind of Carmine-themed personal army or something.",
  ["1001073401_45"]="You're overthinking it.",
  ["1001073401_46"]="Hongxian mutters and grunts.",
  ["1001073401_47"]="First things first, the puppet I made based on you isn't like the usual ones. That style is unique, and I don't have many resources for crafting them.",
  ["1001073401_48"]="If it weren't for the contract clause ensuring my companion's safety, I wouldn't have used it for covering an outsider like you.",
  ["1001073401_49"]="And besides... do you really think a puppet modeled after you is a good idea?!",
  ["1001073401_5"]="Doctors have checked on them multiple times. They're generally okay, though some have been unconscious for a while and are a bit malnourished. They'll need IVs for a few more days.",
  ["1001073401_50"]="For those regular puppets, a little tweak and they're completely obedient to me.",
  ["1001073401_51"]="But your particular model? Completely disobedient, stubborn beyond belief! If I want it to perform even the smallest task, I have to personally coax it—unless I resort to threats or bribery, it refuses to budge!",
  ["1001073401_52"]="Greedy and stubborn, it's definitely one of the worst puppets ever! I swear I won't use it again, no matter what!",
  ["1001073401_53"]="Well, should I... thank you?",
  ["1001073401_54"]="By the way, if I recall correctly, the guy in charge of Qian is called... the Sower, right? Wasn't he quite influential?",
  ["1001073401_55"]="According to Magnifico, he made it very clear at the round table that you and your cohort were never to act against Qian.",
  ["1001073401_56"]="You guys made solid promises, and then you immediately broke them right after the incident in QingYu City.",
  ["1001073401_57"]="Have you ever thought about what might have happened if the Sower hadn't actually died and retaliated?",
  ["1001073401_58"]="\"The Sower is bound to fail. He will perish along with the hesitation that has lingered for millennia.\"",
  ["1001073401_59"]="That's the promise from that Retributor.",
  ["1001073401_6"]="There's something strange though... None of them, whether our members or regular citizens, can remember what happened before they blacked out.",
  ["1001073401_60"]="I believe even a temporary member like you has heard about his achievements... What he promises is like an unerring prophecy.",
  ["1001073401_61"]="And this time is no exception.",
  ["1001073401_62"]="Yeah, sounds cool. That skill must be quite handy when buying lottery tickets.",
  ["1001073401_63"]="After a brief pause, the mercenary seems to recall something.",
  ["1001073401_64"]="By the way, what about that VIP guest named Tiaohua...? What are you planning to do with her?",
  ["1001073401_65"]="The contract only covers helping you take her to the high seas, and then our deal is done, but if you need more... maybe we can sign an additional contract or something?",
  ["1001073401_66"]="Are you trying to get me to divulge something, my little mercenary?",
  ["1001073401_67"]="Heh, why so harsh? It's just a friendly exchange of information.",
  ["1001073401_68"]="Well, it doesn't hurt to tell you, but... since you brought it up, you have to show me your sincerity first.",
  ["1001073401_69"]="Alright, I promise to share everything I know.",
  ["1001073401_7"]="Their memory loss must be linked to that Hongxian.",
  ["1001073401_70"]="I heard that you went to Obed just for the Library of Babel?",
  ["1001073401_71"]="What? You're interested in that desert land?",
  ["1001073401_72"]="The usual smile on Hongxian's face fades.",
  ["1001073401_73"]="In its place is a grim expression not seen before.",
  ["1001073401_74"]="No, I'm interested in their Head Librarian.",
  ["1001073401_75"]="Tell me about that person's background, experiences, relationships... anything related to that Seer!",
  ["1001073401_76"]="Amidst the dark waves, the distant ferry's siren pierces the sky.",
  ["1001073401_77"]="Carrying undisclosed intrigues and secrets, the ship slowly sails into the distance, disappearing beyond the horizon.",
  ["1001073401_78"]="Once again, I find myself back in the familiar lounge.",
  ["1001073401_79"]="All the incidents in QingYu City and CangLin City have concluded. However, I feel no sense of relief within me, as if my burden has not been lifted.",
  ["1001073401_8"]="During this time, I've combed through all the reports about her in the archives.",
  ["1001073401_80"]="Two Eme-an, a girl wielding a lance, and a puppetmaster lugging a piece of wood.",
  ["1001073401_81"]="Just like your pathetic partner, I'm a puppetmaster skilled in manipulating strings and people's souls.",
  ["1001073401_82"]="Yeah, you heard it right. I'm a spy for Nemesis.",
  ["1001073401_84"]="Recalling everything we have been through, I can hardly shake the feeling of uneasiness.",
  ["1001073401_85"]="Wherever we went, faint traces of Nemesis lingered. They were like shadows in the sunlight, always a step ahead of us.",
  ["1001073401_86"]="Zero seems to see completely through my thoughts and is quietly look at me.",
  ["1001073401_87"]="Have faith in our WeiShi companions.",
  ["1001073401_88"]="For millennia, they've been safeguarding this land. Their wisdom and skills should be enough to handle the Nemesis threat.",
  ["1001073401_9"]="Infiltration, impersonation, and memory erasure... Those are her MO. Every time she acts, she induces collective memory loss to cover her tracks.",
  ["1001073401_90"]="...",
  ["1001073401_91"]="I agree. Though Master Yuanquan and WeiShi members are generous with their support... they're not Eme-an after all.",
  ["1001073401_92"]="Nemesis, Ereshan, and the Beacon in your possession... There are still too many mysteries surrounding the Library incident.",
  ["1001073401_93"]="However... with the current strength of Eme-an, we're still far from uncovering the truth.",
  ["1001073401_94"]="Eme-an is merely the secret society watching over Obed. There are other organizations that share our ideals.",
  ["1001073401_96"]="...",
  ["1001073401_97"]="That makes sense. If the Library incident is tied to Nemesis, the other members are likely aware of it.",
  ["1001073401_98"]="Would you like me to brief you on the other organizations, Seer?",
  ["1001073401_99"]="A few names vaguely surface in my mind",
  ["100205101_1"]="Difference Engine",
  ["100205101_10"]="Those Eme-ans from the last century were really into machines designed to save labor. You set your question and parameters, and the machine does the calculating for you automatically.",
  ["100205101_11"]="And this one is no different. It's chugging away on some question, but...",
  ["100205101_12"]="Seems like it hasn't quite cracked the answer yet.",
  ["100205101_13"]="Let me take a look at it...",
  ["100205101_14"]="Enki tilts his head, intrigued.",
  ["100205101_15"]="Well, well, this is interesting. The creator of this machine designed it for long-term operation. Judging by the wear and tear, it's been working for almost a hundred years!",
  ["100205101_16"]="I wonder what it's been trying to calculate?",
  ["100205101_17"]="Enki unfastens the clasp between two connecting parts, and with a slight tremor, the casing of the machine falls off, revealing its intricate inner structure.",
  ["100205101_18"]="Hold on! What the heck is this mess?",
  ["100205101_19"]="Machine parts of all sizes scatter like pebbles on a riverbank.",
  ["100205101_2"]="The light from the carbide lamp flickers slightly.",
  ["100205101_20"]="The layers of copper components and gears are way beyond \"complicated.\"",
  ["100205101_21"]="Seriously, I can't wrap my head around what those idiots were thinking a hundred years ago.",
  ["100205101_22"]="I mean, they wanted to simplify calculations, but why did they make it so darn complicated?",
  ["100205101_23"]="Trying to figure out the original question from this pile of industrial junk is like trying to read the minds of whimsical fools. How am I supposed to make sense of their designs?",
  ["100205101_24"]="Should I just stand here and wait for it to find the answer?",
  ["100205101_25"]="Obviously, this incarnation of curiosity is not known for his patience.",
  ["100205101_26"]="Enki rolls his eyes as an idea strikes him.",
  ["100205101_27"]="Well, if the slow calculation is the only problem here...",
  ["100205101_28"]="Why not give it a little power boost and speed up the calculations?",
  ["100205101_29"]="Enki removes the nuts, adds some resin, and swaps the copper core.",
  ["100205101_3"]="The boy casually strolls through the room, surrounded by a pale golden glow.",
  ["100205101_30"]="Before long, the clunky machine makes a sound like an engine igniting.",
  ["100205101_31"]="Awesome! It's working!",
  ["100205101_32"]="Like I said, handling this machine is a piece of cake!",
  ["100205101_33"]="Under the boy's eager gaze, the messy gears start spinning at a rapid pace.",
  ["100205101_34"]="The boy is so thrilled that he doesn't notice the pressure pointer on the difference engine has already hit its limit.",
  ["100205101_35"]="So, that's how you messed with someone else's invention and caused an explosion in the end?",
  ["100205101_36"]="Come on, what's the big deal? I stumbled upon a functioning difference engine and just gave it a little boost, that's all!",
  ["100205101_37"]="A boost that resulted in an explosion?",
  ["100205101_38"]="It's not my fault! I did all the calculations!",
  ["100205101_39"]="The gears I tweaked were fully compatible with the machine's power system, and even the thermal expansion of the components was well within safe limits! It was supposed to work flawlessly!",
  ["100205101_4"]="This room is just like all the other rooms he's seen in the Library, with bookshelves arranged in a chaotic or organized manner, creating another familiar scene alongside the tiles and walls.",
  ["100205101_40"]="How was I supposed to know this thing was packed with dust? And by pure chance, a couple of specks flew right into the steam furnace, causing the whole thing to go kaboom!",
  ["100205101_41"]="Ninsar shakes her head as black smoke billows out of the machine.",
  ["100205101_42"]="Well, can't you just sit back and wait for the machine to finish its calculations?",
  ["100205101_43"]="No way!",
  ["100205101_44"]="This machine has been running for more than a century! Who knows how much longer it'll take to get the answer?!",
  ["100205101_45"]="Enki's voice softens as he speaks.",
  ["100205101_46"]="Seriously, I didn't mean to break it...",
  ["100205101_47"]="Could you please help me fix the machine, sis? Pretty please?",
  ["100205101_48"]="Ninsar is surprised by Enki's request.",
  ["100205101_49"]="But I thought fixing the machine would be a piece of cake for you?",
  ["100205101_5"]="Huh?",
  ["100205101_50"]="Well, how should I put it?",
  ["100205101_51"]="Fixing the machine itself is easy-peasy, but the real challenge is restoring its calculation data.",
  ["100205101_52"]="Calculation data?",
  ["100205101_53"]="Enki pulls out a charred punched tape.",
  ["100205101_54"]="The burn marks vaguely make out a string of characters that have not fully revealed their true meaning yet.",
  ["100205101_55"]="A difference engine is basically a question-and-answer machine, and the idea behind it is super simple.",
  ["100205101_56"]="Honestly, physically putting it back together wouldn't take more than a few minutes, but that only gets it up and running to answer new questions.",
  ["100205101_57"]="So, if I restart the machine, it'll just wait for someone to ask a new question instead of continuing its previous calculations.",
  ["100205101_58"]="And that means we'll have no clue what it was crunching numbers for or what answer it was about to spit out...",
  ["100205101_59"]="Unless...",
  ["100205101_6"]="What was that sound?",
  ["100205101_60"]="Unless someone painstakingly restores every screw and gear to its pre-explosion state.",
  ["100205101_61"]="Enki blinks and looks at Ninsar with hopeful eyes.",
  ["100205101_62"]="So, my dear sis... Could you please lend me a hand?",
  ["100205101_63"]="Just think about it! This antique machine has been ticking away for a whole century!",
  ["100205101_64"]="You've never tinkered with a machine that's a hundred years old, right, sis? I'm sure you're curious about the answer it'll cough up!",
  ["100205101_65"]="...",
  ["100205101_66"]="Ninsar does not utter a word, but her expression says, \"I couldn't care less.\"",
  ["100205101_67"]="Eventually, she glances at the difference engine and lets out a sigh.",
  ["100205101_68"]="Fine, I guess I'm used to these things by now.",
  ["100205101_69"]="I'll fix the machine for you.",
  ["100205101_7"]="But unlike the other rooms he has been in, this room emits a low, rhythmic buzzing sound.",
  ["100205101_70"]="Enki's face instantly lights up with joy.",
  ["100205101_71"]="Yeah! Awesome!",
  ["100205101_72"]="You're the best, sis!",
  ["100205101_73"]="However.",
  ["100205101_74"]="I have one condition.",
  ["100205101_75"]="Ninsar pauses for a moment.",
  ["100205101_76"]="As a punishment for your reckless tinkering, I'll only handle the final part.",
  ["100205101_77"]="You'll do all the legwork—gather information, find materials, and everything else.",
  ["100205101_8"]="As he tracks the noise, he spots a contraption made of copper columns and gears.",
  ["100205101_9"]="Judging from its shape, it must be a difference engine.",
  ["100205201_1"]="The Meaning of Difference",
  ["100205201_10"]="The machine beside her has been scrubbed clean of the burn marks from the explosion, and all the damaged parts have been carefully put back together.",
  ["100205201_100"]="Each digit in this string of numbers represents a standard day, so the whole thing refers to 42,042 days exactly.",
  ["100205201_101"]="Hearing Ninsar's explanation, Enki strokes his chin, lost in thought.",
  ["100205201_102"]="42,042 days... That's 115 years and 67 days.",
  ["100205201_103"]="If we go back from the day this machine was invented...",
  ["100205201_104"]="Wouldn't that be tomorrow?!",
  ["100205201_105"]="But the date itself doesn't reveal much much than just a number.",
  ["100205201_106"]="So, all we've got is another elusive answer...",
  ["100205201_107"]="To unravel the meaning of the answer, you might need to put yourself in the questioner's shoes.",
  ["100205201_108"]="For us, it might be a vague answer or just a regular date, but for Tuttle, this date holds the key to his life's pursuit.",
  ["100205201_109"]="Enki nods, finally grasping the idea.",
  ["100205201_11"]="However, those are the basic steps for restoring this intricate contraption.",
  ["100205201_110"]="That makes sense. If anyone knows the meaning of the answer, it would be the creator himself.",
  ["100205201_111"]="He poured so much into this contraption, all in an effort to solve a particular question in his research.",
  ["100205201_112"]="If I can somehow decipher the question, maybe I'll figure out the machine's secrets, too.",
  ["100205201_113"]="Well, looks like you're finally catching on.",
  ["100205201_12"]="Let's take a break.",
  ["100205201_13"]="Ninsar looks up. Before she knows it, there's a huge pile of books next to the machine.",
  ["100205201_14"]="Her brother Enki is sprawled in the piles of book, flipping through the books on the shelf.",
  ["100205201_15"]="What a rare sight. Last time I saw you buried in books like this was three sectors ago.",
  ["100205201_16"]="Yeah, all because my mean sis won't let me touch that machine.",
  ["100205201_17"]="So, since I've got nothing to do, I'm just skimming through these books to see if those idiots left anything useful about difference engines.",
  ["100205201_18"]="Found anything interesting?",
  ["100205201_19"]="Nah, not really.",
  ["100205201_2"]="The calculus of differences is a way of converting complicated equations into simpler ones and solving them step by step.",
  ["100205201_20"]="The accounts from the past librarians about the difference engine can be divided into two categories.",
  ["100205201_21"]="Some of them are all about the machine's construction, while others focus on what it actually calculates.",
  ["100205201_22"]="The first category is filled with records like weights, dimensions, patent info, gear structures, material analysis, and all kinds of messy stuff.",
  ["100205201_23"]="It's super detailed, but not helpful at all.",
  ["100205201_24"]="And as for the others? Any valuable insights?",
  ["100205201_25"]="Enki shakes his head.",
  ["100205201_26"]="Not even I can make heads or tails of it. How could those idiots have figured out the answer?",
  ["100205201_27"]="It's all just gibberish like, \"The sixty columns represent the flow of time,\" or \"The irregular punches on the punched cards solve for irrational numbers,\" or some stupid nonsense like that.",
  ["100205201_28"]="The rest of them just gave up thinking and claimed this machine calculates everything in the universe. It's more like they're writing fiction than making scientific guesses!",
  ["100205201_29"]="Well, as the saying goes, the Library has no shortage of two things: knowledge and idiots.",
  ["100205201_3"]="That is the whole idea behind a difference engine.",
  ["100205201_30"]="As Enki grumbles, the sound of flipping books fills the air. The girl delicately picks up the chisel from the table.",
  ["100205201_31"]="With precision, she removes the casing of the machine, revealing numerous mechanical parts held together by blackened cast iron.",
  ["100205201_32"]="This machine was created during a time of great minds, including Watt and Babbage.",
  ["100205201_33"]="Back then, people believed in absolute space-time, that light and objects were composed of particles, and God had not started playing dice yet.",
  ["100205201_34"]="The world was seen as predictable, and the accumulation of knowledge was progressing steadily. All they had to do was follow in the footsteps of their predecessors.",
  ["100205201_35"]="And librarian Tuttle was one of them.",
  ["100205201_36"]="She meticulously disassembled the core of the arithmetic library, constructing a massive clock-like assembly of thousands of gears.",
  ["100205201_37"]="He poured immense effort into building this difference engine.",
  ["100205201_38"]="Because he firmly believed that mechanical arithmetic held the answers to all questions, and all he needed to do was focus on improving craftsmanship and computational efficiency.",
  ["100205201_39"]="\"Ask it about the height of the Tower of Babel, and it will measure every brick until it adds them all up to the heavens.\"",
  ["100205201_4"]="Ask it about the height of the Tower of Babel, and it will measure every brick until it adds them all up to the heavens.",
  ["100205201_40"]="\"Ask it about the location of a sword on the seabed, and it will drain every drop of water and shovel every inch of soil until it uncovers the sword.\"",
  ["100205201_41"]="However, it never occurred to him that the tower had already crumbled or that the sword had rusted away before the machine could complete its calculation.",
  ["100205201_42"]="Librarian Tuttle never obtained the answer before taking his last breath.",
  ["100205201_43"]="The machine was left running for a hundred years, gradually fading into obscurity.",
  ["100205201_44"]="The girl extends her finger and turns the pulley.",
  ["100205201_45"]="With the force of kinetic energy, the gears from a century ago emit a soft and smooth operating sound.",
  ["100205201_46"]="Huh? Is it finally working?",
  ["100205201_47"]="Not quite yet.",
  ["100205201_48"]="I've restored most of its basic features, but there's one final part missing.",
  ["100205201_49"]="By the way, how is it going on your end?",
  ["100205201_5"]="Ask it about the location of a sword on the seabed, and it will drain every drop of water and shovel every inch of soil until it uncovers the sword.",
  ["100205201_50"]="Ninsar looks down and sees Enki arranging books like he is playing dominos.",
  ["100205201_51"]="You were talking about searching for information on difference engines.",
  ["100205201_52"]="Have you lost interest already?",
  ["100205201_53"]="Nah, it's not me. It's those stupid librarians who lost interest over time.",
  ["100205201_54"]="I've gone through the rest of the books. They're all piled up here now.",
  ["100205201_55"]="As time went on, people cared less and less about that difference engine and its dim-witted inventor.",
  ["100205201_56"]="In the past decade or so, they didn't even bother mentioning it and just called it an \"antique machine.\"",
  ["100205201_57"]="Like Enki says, librarians have their own research priorities.",
  ["100205201_58"]="In Eme-an, where theoretical advancements occur hourly, Tuttle's story and his difference engine are simply one of thousands of insignificant puzzles.",
  ["100205201_59"]="The machine, which had been operational for a century, was destined to be forgotten, along with its era.",
  ["100205201_6"]="Therefore, no matter how complex a difference engine may seem, it always follows the rule of \"simplify the complexity and solve the calculation step by step.\"",
  ["100205201_60"]="Until an intrepid explorer and an unexpected explosion brought new life to it.",
  ["100205201_61"]="The girl tightens the final nut and carefully aligns the remaining columns of the machine.",
  ["100205201_62"]="Soon, the machine resumes its soothing hum.",
  ["100205201_63"]="There we go. All fixed up now.",
  ["100205201_64"]="I've kept the modifications you made earlier, so this machine will finish its calculation in no time.",
  ["100205201_65"]="In an instant, a thin wisp of smoke rises from the machine's top, and a paper tape with the answer unravels as the gears turn.",
  ["100205201_66"]="What are you waiting for? Just spit out the answer already!",
  ["100205201_67"]="I'll just pull it out!",
  ["100205201_68"]="Enki swiftly grabs the partially ejected paper, holding it up in the air with excitement.",
  ["100205201_69"]="So, what's the answer?",
  ["100205201_7"]="Therefore, to revive this broken machine...",
  ["100205201_70"]="Hey, don't spoil the fun!",
  ["100205201_71"]="Enki clutches the paper tape tightly, like a kid with a brand-new toy.",
  ["100205201_72"]="You're not gonna ruin the fun! Let me figure it out first!",
  ["100205201_73"]="Ghaaa... Whoaaah!",
  ["100205201_74"]="What the heck is this machine trying to figure out?!",
  ["100205201_75"]="Within a mere five minutes, Enki's mood takes a wild ride from excitement to frustration and finally to despair.",
  ["100205201_76"]="He plops down on the floor, hanging his head low, looking totally defeated.",
  ["100205201_77"]="Ninsar comes over to him.",
  ["100205201_78"]="Need a hand?",
  ["100205201_79"]="Please, don't!",
  ["100205201_8"]="We'll need some good old-fashioned patience.",
  ["100205201_80"]="Enki's eyes flicker with a hint of hesitation.",
  ["100205201_81"]="Ah... never mind...",
  ["100205201_82"]="Fine, take a look at it...",
  ["100205201_83"]="Reluctantly, Enki hands over the crumpled paper tape to Ninsar.",
  ["100205201_84"]="The tape is filled with several numbers punched into it.",
  ["100205201_85"]="<color=#fec66b>\"42042\"</color>",
  ["100205201_86"]="I was trying to work backward from the answer and figure out the question, but... but...",
  ["100205201_87"]="But this answer is so darn vague!",
  ["100205201_88"]="Enki's face turns red.",
  ["100205201_89"]="I've only been doing the math for like five minutes, and I've already come up with a hundred different explanations that could match this five-digit number.",
  ["100205201_9"]="Slowly, the girl puts down her tools.",
  ["100205201_90"]="The cosmic constant, the size of planets, even the number of stars in a nebula... it could be anything!",
  ["100205201_91"]="That stupid librarian... He didn't even label what unit it's in! Who knows what these numbers are supposed to represent?!",
  ["100205201_92"]="Ninsar takes the tape and skims over it.",
  ["100205201_93"]="But this time, even she seems unsure.",
  ["100205201_94"]="Unfortunately, I can't figure out the question from its answer.",
  ["100205201_95"]="But... I can tell that the string of numbers represents a specific time.",
  ["100205201_96"]="What kind of time?",
  ["100205201_97"]="Enki's head perks up.",
  ["100205201_98"]="Is it some fancy numeration system popular a hundred years ago? Or maybe it's a cryptic time spot?",
  ["100205201_99"]="It's actually simpler than you'd expect.",
  ["100217101_1"]="Emergency Evacuation",
  ["100217101_10"]="Actually, I had something urgent to discuss with Xin when I called her.",
  ["100217101_11"]="Ever since we received the analysis results from Delphic Oracle, we've been working to contain the Cerulean Blight.",
  ["100217101_12"]="Unfortunately, the contaminated water from the Grandeur River has already caused irreversible effects on the Fertile Plains.",
  ["100217101_13"]="Many beasts and livestock affected by the Cerulean Blight have become unusually aggressive, and we've received numerous accident reports... To ensure the safety of those people, we need to evacuate the area.",
  ["100217101_14"]="I'm entrusting this task to you, Xin.",
  ["100217101_15"]="Upon hearing those words, Xin's expression turns serious.",
  ["100217101_16"]="Evacuation? Let me see what's going on there.",
  ["100217101_17"]="Leaving those words, Xin takes the map from the table and swiftly reads it.",
  ["100217101_18"]="When her gaze settles on a particular spot, a grim expression emanates from her face.",
  ["100217101_19"]="Hold on! Isn't this Peace Community where Xiaoyun lives?",
  ["100217101_2"]="Two days after we were attacked by the giant bear, Xin receives a call from Qing.",
  ["100217101_20"]="Xiaoyun? You mean the girl from the cram school...",
  ["100217101_21"]="She's not far from here, just a few blocks away... Xiaoyun lives there alone, Qing. I need to go check on her.",
  ["100217101_22"]="Time is ticking! I'm on my way!",
  ["100217101_23"]="Xin! Don't rush in!",
  ["100217101_24"]="Before Qing can finish her words, Xin vanishes in the blink of an eye.",
  ["100217101_25"]="...",
  ["100217101_26"]="Please pardon her impatience, Head Librarian.",
  ["100217101_27"]="Xin is always so hurried.",
  ["100217101_28"]="So, Xin is overseeing the evacuation...",
  ["100217101_29"]="Can she really handle it?",
  ["100217101_3"]="Being present at the time, I follow her lead and arrive at WeiShi.",
  ["100217101_30"]="Please don't worry, Head Librarian. While Xin can be impulsive, her dedication matches mine.",
  ["100217101_31"]="However... given the importance of the evacuation, it might not be wise to let her go solo.",
  ["100217101_32"]="Zero is still recovering from her injuries, and I have no other pressing matters.",
  ["100217101_33"]="Maybe I can go along to support her?",
  ["100217101_34"]="In that case, thank you so much, Head Librarian. With your help, I feel more at ease.",
  ["100217101_35"]="But please do be careful, especially after the recent attack on you.",
  ["100217101_36"]="Sure thing, I'll keep that in mind.",
  ["100217101_37"]="I'll get my camouflage gear ready.",
  ["100217101_4"]="The once serene and refined hall is now brimming with tension and gravity. Upon learning the truth about Cerulean Blight, everyone engages in a race against time.",
  ["100217101_5"]="Only when I reach the center of the hall does Qing notice my arrival.",
  ["100217101_6"]="Oh, Head Librarian... You're here too.",
  ["100217101_7"]="Sorry for not welcoming you properly. I've been swamped with urgent matters.",
  ["100217101_8"]="Your voice sounded urgent...",
  ["100217101_9"]="Is it something urgent?",
  ["100217102_1"]="Following the evacuation of the nearby neighborhood, the barricades are restored.",
  ["100217102_10"]="The WeiShi member takes a notebook and meticulously cross-checks it.",
  ["100217102_11"]="No, she isn't on the evacuation list, but I remember seeing her name in another notebook... Let me double-check.",
  ["100217102_12"]="Yeah, it seems she's not included in the evacuees.",
  ["100217102_13"]="Wait! Are you sure about this? How could this happen?!",
  ["100217102_14"]="The community committee identified residents who are currently out of the city and excluded them from the evacuation. Look here, her family is away on a trip and doesn't need evacuation.",
  ["100217102_15"]="Upon hearing this, Xin's face immediately turns pale.",
  ["100217102_16"]="Only her parents are away! Xiaoyun has been here the whole time, in the city!",
  ["100217102_17"]="I met her at the cram school just last week.",
  ["100217102_18"]="Upon hearing her words, he hastens to investigate further.",
  ["100217102_19"]="You're right. The committee is working on a family basis. If what you're saying is true, this is a major oversight on our part.",
  ["100217102_2"]="As I glance over them, the previously scattered residents at the evacuation spot have queued up in an orderly manner, evacuating under WeiShi's coordination.",
  ["100217102_20"]="As he realizes this error, sweat beads begin to form on his forehead.",
  ["100217102_21"]="My apologies. I'll immediately cross-check similar cases and update the list.",
  ["100217102_22"]="I'll call for reinforcements and begin the rescue operation as soon as possible. Before that, Xin, could you...?",
  ["100217102_23"]="Call for reinforcements? How long will that take?",
  ["100217102_24"]="No, I'm not waiting around! I'll go get her myself, even if it means fighting through those beasts!",
  ["100217102_25"]="Ignoring the others, Xin leaps over the barricade and ventures into the block alone.",
  ["100217102_26"]="I... I haven't finished explaining...",
  ["100217102_27"]="The sudden turn of events leaves the male member frozen in place, wearing expressions of resignation.",
  ["100217102_28"]="Ah, she's just as impulsive as always.",
  ["100217102_29"]="You don't seem surprised.",
  ["100217102_3"]="Thanks for your help! Without you, the locals would have been stuck here for quite a while!",
  ["100217102_30"]="You've grown used to it, haven't you?",
  ["100217102_31"]="Xin's always been like that. I knew she'd react that way.",
  ["100217102_32"]="The signal tower here was damaged by a beast, so it might take some time to fix it.",
  ["100217102_33"]="Our reinforcements won't be here soon, but I doubt Xin will sit still. I was actually planning to let her go ahead.",
  ["100217102_34"]="But it's too risky for her to go alone...",
  ["100217102_35"]="I approach the member and take the notebook from the table.",
  ["100217102_36"]="Could you tell me where Xiaoyun lives?",
  ["100217102_4"]="Don't mention it! Those critters weren't even a warm-up!",
  ["100217102_5"]="Yeah, if there's nothing else, you can head back to HQ.",
  ["100217102_6"]="Once we've relocated the residents to safety, we'll lock down the area.",
  ["100217102_7"]="Upon hearing his words, Xin appears to recollect something as she swiftly surveys the line of evacuated residents.",
  ["100217102_8"]="Have you met a girl named Xiaoyun among the residents here?",
  ["100217102_9"]="Xiaoyun... Hold on, let me check.",
  ["100217201_1"]="Having swiftly dealt with the beast, Xin sprints towards the entrance of the building, ascending the steps and turning the handle on the door.",
  ["100217201_10"]="If you got hurt by those mindless beasts, Qing would give me an earful!",
  ["100217201_11"]="I can take care of myself just fine.",
  ["100217201_12"]="Are you really sure you can handle this alone?",
  ["100217201_13"]="Huh?! What are you talking about? Who do you think took on those beasts along the way?",
  ["100217201_14"]="Alright, if you're that capable...",
  ["100217201_15"]="Then why are you standing here, stuck outside the door?",
  ["100217201_16"]="H-hey! It's... it's because...",
  ["100217201_17"]="Xin flushes with awkwardness.",
  ["100217201_18"]="Because the door is locked! I knocked but nobody answered, so here I am!",
  ["100217201_19"]="I can't just barge in, right? If I did that, how am I any different from those frenzied beasts...?",
  ["100217201_2"]="*Clunk*",
  ["100217201_20"]="I've marked her place on this map. Just follow this street, and you'll find it.",
  ["100217201_21"]="Oh, and take this spare key. Her parents left it with the community before they left.",
  ["100217201_22"]="Recalling the male member's words, I take out the spare key from my pocket.",
  ["100217201_23"]="With a crisp \"click,\" the door swings open.",
  ["100217201_24"]="You... you... Where did you get that key?",
  ["100217201_25"]="That member gave it to me.",
  ["100217201_26"]="He wanted you to take it.",
  ["100217201_27"]="But you left before he finished speaking.",
  ["100217201_28"]="Well, I... alright...",
  ["100217201_29"]="Upon entering Xiaoyun's house, we find her lying unconscious on the bed in her bedroom.",
  ["100217201_3"]="The only sound is the clinking of the lock. The door does not budge.",
  ["100217201_30"]="Her eyes closed, complexion pallid, emitting labored breaths.",
  ["100217201_31"]="Her forehead... it's really hot! Is she running a fever?",
  ["100217201_32"]="Qing said for a cold or fever, you need to get some fever medicine first...",
  ["100217201_33"]="Without delay, Xin begins rummaging through the cabinets.",
  ["100217201_34"]="All these cabinets are full of clothes... And this box... No, what do these words mean? I can't read them!",
  ["100217201_35"]="Oh no... What should I do? Her forehead is getting hotter!",
  ["100217201_36"]="Hey, calm down.",
  ["100217201_37"]="Rising quickly, I gently move Xin's hand aside.",
  ["100217201_38"]="Find a tower and dampen it with cold water...",
  ["100217201_39"]="While waiting for Zero to awaken in the motorhome, I read books on first aid. Recalling from memory, I roughly complete cold compresses to reduce the fever.",
  ["100217201_4"]="Huh?",
  ["100217201_40"]="Although Xiaoyun has not fully awakened, her complexion has visibly improved.",
  ["100217201_41"]="Xin, standing by her bedside, has also put aside her previous hostility.",
  ["100217201_42"]="Wow, I-I didn't expect you to be so good at handling a fever like that...",
  ["100217201_43"]="And yeah, and if you hadn't brought the key... I'd still be stuck outside...",
  ["100217201_44"]="A-anyway... Th-thank you... yeah...",
  ["100217201_45"]="Xin's voice trails off, eventually dwindling to a whisper akin to the chirping of a bird.",
  ["100217201_46"]="You are welcome.",
  ["100217201_47"]="Oh, sorry, I missed that. Could you say it again?",
  ["100217201_48"]="You... Let's just f-forget I said anything!",
  ["100217201_49"]="By the way...",
  ["100217201_5"]="Following the map, I swiftly navigate through the neighborhood.",
  ["100217201_50"]="Why did you insist on coming alone?",
  ["100217201_51"]="Wouldn't it have been better to wait for reinforcements?",
  ["100217201_52"]="When you can handle things on your own, why ask for help?",
  ["100217201_53"]="Instead of waiting around for reinforcements that might take forever, I'd rather take action myself... At least I can help Xiaoyun right away.",
  ["100217201_54"]="Your colleagues are all working hard to complete the evacuation.",
  ["100217201_55"]="Maybe you could trust them a little more.",
  ["100217201_56"]="But what if they let you down?",
  ["100217201_57"]="I don't want to risk my friend's safety by relying on others. I'd rather do what I can by myself.",
  ["100217201_58"]="Leaving those words, Xin shows a somewhat somber expression.",
  ["100217201_59"]="This is the first time I have witnessed such an emotional display from her.",
  ["100217201_6"]="While I was prepared for a fierce encounter, all I see along the way is incapacitated beasts on both sides of the road.",
  ["100217201_60"]="What's happening?",
  ["100217201_61"]="Just, forget it. I remembered something, that's all.",
  ["100217201_62"]="What is it?",
  ["100217201_63"]="Why do you want to know? It's not really a tale worth telling. You...",
  ["100217201_64"]="Tell me more. Maybe I can help.",
  ["100217201_65"]="How could you possibly help...?",
  ["100217201_66"]="Actually... Alright, fine.",
  ["100217201_67"]="Transitioning from a grim expression to one of hesitation, Xin eventually releases a heavy sigh. Rarely does she show such hesitation, indicating the seriousness of this matter in her mind.",
  ["100217201_68"]="...Well, back then, I went through something similar.",
  ["100217201_69"]="It was when I was in the Xiji Region with my parents still around.",
  ["100217201_7"]="Upon arriving at Xiaoyun's residence, I faintly glimpse Xin's figure.",
  ["100217201_70"]="I made a mistake... and trusted the wrong people...",
  ["100217201_8"]="Huh? What brings you here?",
  ["100217201_9"]="I told you I could handle this on my own.",
  ["100217301_1"]="Remote Western Region",
  ["100217301_10"]="From snowy fields to rivers, then back to the wilderness.",
  ["100217301_100"]="You can take all these things!",
  ["100217301_101"]="Just give us something to eat... You can have whatever you want...",
  ["100217301_102"]="At times, it surfaced as avarice.",
  ["100217301_103"]="No, this won't do.",
  ["100217301_104"]="Your sheep are too thin. This is all I can offer.",
  ["100217301_105"]="Not interested? Fine, leave as you wish.",
  ["100217301_106"]="But mark my words, things are only pricier on the other side of the mountains.",
  ["100217301_107"]="And at times, it manifested as malice.",
  ["100217301_108"]="Come to me, guys! Those folks have something juicy!",
  ["100217301_109"]="You two, head over there!",
  ["100217301_11"]="She followed the sheep faithfully, moment by moment.",
  ["100217301_110"]="The rest of you, follow me. Let's block their path!",
  ["100217301_111"]="Don't let those sheep run away!",
  ["100217301_112"]="Cold, hunger, illness, and disasters wrought by humans...",
  ["100217301_113"]="When they finally return to the village, their herd had significantly dwindled, with only a few emaciated sheep remaining.",
  ["100217301_114"]="The once verdant pastures in the village had turned into barren fields, and the previously bountiful pear trees now stood as shriveled husks.",
  ["100217301_115"]="Equally somber were the souls of the inhabitants on this land.",
  ["100217301_116"]="Go back. We won't sell our grain.",
  ["100217301_117"]="But we've come all the way from the far north...",
  ["100217301_118"]="A \"no\" is a \"no.\" Where you're from won't change that.",
  ["100217301_119"]="It's another year of drought, and no one has extra grain to spare for you herders.",
  ["100217301_12"]="Only during autumn and winter would her parents return her to the village of her birth, concluding their year-long migration.",
  ["100217301_120"]="If you want grain, try trading some of our sheep for it.",
  ["100217301_121"]="But this... this won't work...",
  ["100217301_122"]="As herders, Xin's family depended on the sheep for sustenance, and the new lambs each year were just enough to maintain the herd.",
  ["100217301_123"]="To them, every sheep represented a glimmer of hope, and parting with them would mean forsaking the promise of a future.",
  ["100217301_124"]="However, a seasoned voice emerged from behind her.",
  ["100217301_125"]="Go fetch the sheep, Xin.",
  ["100217301_126"]="But Dad...",
  ["100217301_127"]="Our supplies are running low. We need to get ready for winter.",
  ["100217301_128"]="Plus, the land here is much harsher. Our sheep won't make it through this winter.",
  ["100217301_129"]="It might be best to sell them all together.",
  ["100217301_13"]="Why are you sitting here alone, dear? Come on, have an autumn pear.",
  ["100217301_130"]="But we can't! Without those sheep, how will we survive next year...",
  ["100217301_131"]="I get it, Xin.",
  ["100217301_132"]="But we need to focus on today, or we might not even make it to next year.",
  ["100217301_133"]="Her father's demeanor remained as carefree as usual.",
  ["100217301_134"]="Yet, as he took the rope, Xin keenly noticed his trembling hands... Her father had watched these sheep grow, understanding their significance all too well.",
  ["100217301_135"]="At that instant, however, they had no other choice.",
  ["100217301_136"]="Reflecting back, that specific year witnessed more turmoil in the village compared to previous ones.",
  ["100217301_137"]="Nights were filled with clamor and unrest—wolves occasionally descended from the mountains, and gunshots echoed through the air.",
  ["100217301_138"]="Whenever they returned to the village, she noticed the residents gripping farm tools vigilantly... as if guarding against a threat more menacing than wild animals.",
  ["100217301_139"]="It was the night before winter.",
  ["100217301_14"]="Xin shook her head, declining the autumn pear from her father.",
  ["100217301_140"]="The moon gleamed cold and clear, lighting the way for the sheep to graze on the dry grass.",
  ["100217301_141"]="Following her routine, she guided the sheep out of the sheepfold, passing the time by counting the stars...",
  ["100217301_142"]="Until a pair of eerie green eyes appeared behind her.",
  ["100217301_143"]="Get away! Go!",
  ["100217301_144"]="Quick! Or the wolves will catch us!",
  ["100217301_145"]="Hastily, she herded the flock back home, but the eyes multiplied, closing in rapidly, almost catching up...",
  ["100217301_146"]="Hurry, Xin!",
  ["100217301_147"]="Just as the wolves' howls drew nearer, a blaze flickered ahead.",
  ["100217301_148"]="Dad, behind me... there are all wolves!",
  ["100217301_149"]="Don't worry. With this torch, those wolves won't come any closer.",
  ["100217301_15"]="Did those kids give you a hard time?",
  ["100217301_150"]="But Dad... you said we mustn't light a fire!",
  ["100217301_151"]="Because that would attract something much dangerous than wolves!",
  ["100217301_152"]="Fearfully, Xin glanced behind.",
  ["100217301_153"]="Apart from the wolves, she heard a constant rustling in the forest she had crossed.",
  ["100217301_154"]="Forget it, Xin.",
  ["100217301_155"]="There are too many wolves. If we don't light a fire, they'll devour all the sheep.",
  ["100217301_156"]="Mom and Dad will stay here to guard. Just head back to the village, Xin... and don't worry about anything else.",
  ["100217301_157"]="But... I can't...",
  ["100217301_158"]="Those wolves are still behind us. What if they...",
  ["100217301_159"]="Don't fret, Xin.",
  ["100217301_16"]="Xin nodded with a sense of grievance.",
  ["100217301_160"]="Follow the light of the fire back to the village. The wolves won't bother you.",
  ["100217301_161"]="Just go... and don't look back.",
  ["100217301_162"]="Without hesitation, Xin sprinted all the way back to the village.",
  ["100217301_163"]="Alerting the villagers about the wolves down the mountain, she guided them towards the foothills.",
  ["100217301_164"]="There it is! Once we get down this mountain, it's our pasture.",
  ["100217301_165"]="Why... stop?",
  ["100217301_166"]="For some reason, upon glimpsing the firelight, the villagers started exchanging whispers.",
  ["100217301_167"]="Their pace gradually slowed until they came to a stop, refusing to move any further.",
  ["100217301_168"]="There are so many of us. Even if there are wolves below, they'll run when they see us.",
  ["100217301_169"]="...",
  ["100217301_17"]="It's been a year, and they don't even remember me anymore!",
  ["100217301_170"]="Hurry! Stop waste time! Mom and Dad could be in danger!",
  ["100217301_171"]="Anxiously, Xin peered downhill. The once modest fire had grown more radiant, accompanied by sporadic sharp noises.",
  ["100217301_172"]="No, it's not the wolves. It's the poachers attracted by the fire.",
  ["100217301_173"]="...Poachers?",
  ["100217301_174"]="The villager exhibited mixed emotions.",
  ["100217301_175"]="They're a gang of criminals from the Western Region, poaching wildlife and doing other crimes.",
  ["100217301_176"]="After the harsh drought, many areas were left unguarded... so they grew more daring... even robbing and killing travelers.",
  ["100217301_177"]="But... but aren't they even more dangerous than wolves?",
  ["100217301_178"]="That's why we must help Mom and Dad...",
  ["100217301_179"]="Bang!",
  ["100217301_18"]="The adults all say things like, \"Oh, you've grown taller, Jin!\" or \"Hey, you've become prettier, Kin!\"... None of them get my name right...",
  ["100217301_180"]="A sudden gunshot cut short Xin's cries.",
  ["100217301_181"]="She had not anticipated that the distant echoes of gunfire from her memory would reverberate so close, at the base of the mountain.",
  ["100217301_182"]="Boo... boo-hoo...",
  ["100217301_183"]="Nor had she foreseen the weightiness of fear.",
  ["100217301_184"]="At the echo of gunfire, her feet involuntarily rooted, her body instinctively recoiling.",
  ["100217301_185"]="Don't light a fire, Xin. That could attract something much more dangerous than wolves.",
  ["100217301_186"]="At that moment, Xin recalled her father's words.",
  ["100217301_187"]="Don't let your parents' efforts be in vain...",
  ["100217301_188"]="Let's go down the mountain once the gunshots stop.",
  ["100217301_189"]="Upon arriving home, Xin was taken aback by a scene that evoked a sense of suffocation.",
  ["100217301_19"]="I bet our sheep would recognize me faster than they do!",
  ["100217301_190"]="Pillaged residences and sheepfold, with livestock either taken or slaughtered, met their gaze.",
  ["100217301_191"]="Her father, with a memory as enduring as a mountain, now lay amidst the wreckage, cradling his mother, whose life had faded away.",
  ["100217301_192"]="Xin...? Is that you?",
  ["100217301_193"]="Xin clung tightly to her father's hand, yearning to preserve that warmth, yet sensing the inevitable chill creeping into her fingertips.",
  ["100217301_194"]="I'm sorry, Dad... I'm so sorry...",
  ["100217301_195"]="I went back to the village and brought everyone here...",
  ["100217301_196"]="But...",
  ["100217301_197"]="Upon hearing his daughter's cries, her father displayed an expression of relief as he glanced towards the empty sheepfold at home.",
  ["100217301_198"]="It's alright. You're safe, that's what matters...",
  ["100217301_199"]="How's our livestock...? Check it for me. I can't see well...",
  ["100217301_2"]="The remote Western Region is distinguished by its vast barren lands.",
  ["100217301_20"]="Her father grinned, patting her little head.",
  ["100217301_200"]="The sheepfold they had meticulously constructed now stood vacant, devoid of even a single lamb.",
  ["100217301_201"]="Witnessing his father's pallor, however, Xin resolutely bit her lips and nodded in silence.",
  ["100217301_202"]="It's all fine...",
  ["100217301_203"]="Ahh, good to know.",
  ["100217301_204"]="This way, I'm relieved...",
  ["100217301_205"]="The man's glassy eyes showed a hint of solace.",
  ["100217301_206"]="You once asked me when we'd find a place to settle down... I used to tend to our livestock, haggling with the merchants...",
  ["100217301_207"]="Back then, I dreamed of the day we could sell them for a good price, so I could take you to town and find you a good teacher...",
  ["100217301_208"]="But things didn't go as planned... with this unexpected drought...",
  ["100217301_209"]="No, I don't want to go to town anymore... I mean it...",
  ["100217301_21"]="Come on, kiddo... They don't remember you because you're still so young.",
  ["100217301_210"]="You promised me... as long as we keep moving, the drought will end someday... I don't want anything. I just want you and Mom here with me...",
  ["100217301_211"]="Raindrops of sorrow continued to fall, tracing paths down the man's face.",
  ["100217301_212"]="Despite his desire to wipe away those tear-like droplets, his arms felt weak, disobedient to his command.",
  ["100217301_213"]="Summoning the last of his strength, he managed a faint smile of reassurance.",
  ["100217301_214"]="This Western Region... Neither our parents nor us could leave it.",
  ["100217301_215"]="I wonder, how much farther does this place stretch... to the end...",
  ["100217301_216"]="Sell those sheep, Xin... They'll fetch a good price in this drought...",
  ["100217301_217"]="This is where my journey ends... You'll do well on your own...",
  ["100217301_218"]="Subsequent events blurred in Xin's memory.",
  ["100217301_219"]="She could only recall encountering the villagers again after sorting through everything. They stood in a group, exchanging words one after the other.",
  ["100217301_22"]="Keep visiting them as you grow up, and they'll start to remember you.",
  ["100217301_220"]="Those ruthless bandits... They didn't spare even two simple herders...",
  ["100217301_221"]="How will a young girl like her survive in the future...?",
  ["100217301_222"]="We never saw this coming... If only we had known...",
  ["100217301_223"]="Perhaps they were filled with anger, sorrow, or maybe guilt.",
  ["100217301_224"]="But Xin could no longer discern the emotions.",
  ["100217301_225"]="They... can't have gone too far.",
  ["100217301_226"]="Will you help me avenge Mom and Dad?",
  ["100217301_227"]="After a brief silence, those voices once again filled with uncertainty, dissent, and contention.",
  ["100217301_228"]="But they have guns... we...",
  ["100217301_229"]="That's not something you should think about, little one...",
  ["100217301_23"]="Xin shook her head, shrugging off her father's hand as if causing a scene.",
  ["100217301_230"]="They're just some herders outside the village. Why bother about them...?",
  ["100217301_231"]="A pervasive coldness, a numbing sensation.",
  ["100217301_232"]="Yet, for an inexplicable reason, Xin found herself unsurprised by this outcome.",
  ["100217301_233"]="...",
  ["100217301_234"]="Indeed, she had expected it.",
  ["100217301_235"]="Just give us something to eat... You can have whatever you want...",
  ["100217301_236"]="But mark my words, things are only pricier on the other side of the mountains.",
  ["100217301_237"]="Hey, follow me! We'll block that path!",
  ["100217301_238"]="The inhabitants of this land had endured too much to concern themselves with others. Like withered grass in a sandstorm, they struggled to survive.",
  ["100217301_239"]="...Pretty much like herself now.",
  ["100217301_24"]="You're lying, Dad!",
  ["100217301_240"]="Dad always used to say, just keep moving...",
  ["100217301_241"]="So that all the suffering I've endured will end somewhere...",
  ["100217301_242"]="I'll just keep going... until I can't walk anymore...",
  ["100217301_243"]="Whether driven by a desire for vengeance or to avoid witnessing the vacant gazes of the villagers...",
  ["100217301_244"]="Xin could no longer distinguish.",
  ["100217301_245"]="All that remained vivid was the memory of walking along the pastoral path at dawn.",
  ["100217301_246"]="The golden sunlight illuminated her face, yet instead of warmth, it carried a sharp chill.",
  ["100217301_247"]="Silently retrieving the staff left by her father, she left behind the warmth of the past and the echoing voices.",
  ["100217301_25"]="After today, we'll have to move again...",
  ["100217301_26"]="Yeah, we've been in this village for a while now.",
  ["100217301_27"]="Time flies, and once your mom finishes making the cheese curd, it's time for us to move on.",
  ["100217301_28"]="I don't get why we have to keep moving like this.",
  ["100217301_29"]="Why can't we just stay in the village all the time?",
  ["100217301_3"]="When Xin reflects on her past in the Western Region, the primary memory that emerges is not of the mountains or desolate expanses.",
  ["100217301_30"]="The girl silently gazed at the mountain meadow nestled between the peaks and the village.",
  ["100217301_31"]="In stark contrast to the desolation she witnessed en route, the village always boasted lush pastures and pear trees.",
  ["100217301_32"]="Naturally, the period of returning to her home village marked the most delightful time of the year for her, free from the toils of shepherding under the sun and rain.",
  ["100217301_33"]="However, this respite lasted only half a month. When the autumn pears ripened, she would need to say goodbye to the warm, fertile pastures and venture back into the desolate and solitary wilderness.",
  ["100217301_34"]="There's plenty of space for us our sheep and cattle, and we'll have a cozy house and delicious autumn pears...",
  ["100217301_35"]="I just don't get why we have to herd the sheep in the cold, windy wilderness, sometimes going hungry...",
  ["100217301_36"]="If I could have stayed here a bit longer, maybe the villagers would remember my name.",
  ["100217301_37"]="Her father pondered for a moment before gesturing towards the towering mountains beyond the pasture.",
  ["100217301_38"]="Can you see those peaks over there, Xin?",
  ["100217301_39"]="Following her father's gesture, Xin shifted her gaze to the distant northern mountains, draped in a delicate white veil.",
  ["100217301_4"]="Instead, it is the winding pastoral trails weaving through the mountains.",
  ["100217301_40"]="Is that mountain... covered in snow?",
  ["100217301_41"]="Yes, the first snow has arrived up north.",
  ["100217301_42"]="Autumn doesn't last long in the Western Region. In a month, this snow will reach the south. So, once these autumn pears ripen, we'll have to leave.",
  ["100217301_43"]="But snow isn't so bad, right? We've got warm cotton clothes and plenty of firewood in the village, so we'll be fine even in winter.",
  ["100217301_44"]="As you said, we'll be fine.",
  ["100217301_45"]="But what about our sheep?",
  ["100217301_46"]="They...",
  ["100217301_47"]="Xin hesitated, observing the lively lambs in the pasture.",
  ["100217301_48"]="She knew well that the lambs born in spring had not yet developed thick wool to withstand the snow.",
  ["100217301_49"]="It's not just the lambs. Even the grown sheep will have a tough time.",
  ["100217301_5"]="Hailing from a herder's family, Xin has traversed these dirt paths for as long as memory serves.",
  ["100217301_50"]="Once the snow comes, most of the pasture will wither, leaving the sheep with nothing to eat no matter how much they search.",
  ["100217301_51"]="Many of the sheep and cattle will get sick and hungry, and most of them won't make it through the winter.",
  ["100217301_52"]="Can't we figure it out?",
  ["100217301_53"]="Like finding a piece of grassland that stays green all year round...",
  ["100217301_54"]="I know you love the village, Xin... but sometimes things just don't go the way we want.",
  ["100217301_55"]="Even the grass here goes through the winter rest, the snow melting in spring, the sunny summer days, completing all four seasons before turning green and lush again.",
  ["100217301_56"]="It's just like tending to the sheep.",
  ["100217301_57"]="They give birth in spring, bulk up in summer, come back home in autumn, and move in winter.",
  ["100217301_58"]="We're herders, making a living on this land and depending on what nature provides.",
  ["100217301_59"]="Only by following the rhythms of this land can we thrive.",
  ["100217301_6"]="As a baby, she lay cradled in her mother's arms, observing the grass swaying in the breeze.",
  ["100217301_60"]="Therefore, alongside her parents and their herd, Xin continued to tread the winding pastoral path.",
  ["100217301_61"]="In late autumn, they left the village before the first snowfall, traveling southward to the wilderness.",
  ["100217301_62"]="And in late spring, they journeyed back through the valley, enduring the winds and sun, returning to their homeland in the north of the Western Region.",
  ["100217301_63"]="Diligently and methodically, they followed the cycle of the seasons in the Western Region.",
  ["100217301_64"]="Xin vividly remembers an unusually warm winter one year, with no snow until the onset of winter.",
  ["100217301_65"]="Unaware of this anomaly, Xin enthusiastically called her father's attention, pointing towards the snowless peaks to the north.",
  ["100217301_66"]="Look, Dad! Those mountains over there aren't covered in snow!",
  ["100217301_67"]="Maybe we won't have to endure the cold this year!",
  ["100217301_68"]="To his surprise, her father stood still, his face marked with sorrow, eventually releasing a long sigh.",
  ["100217301_69"]="Things about to change...",
  ["100217301_7"]="As a toddler, she sat on her father's shoulders, watching geese soar across the sky.",
  ["100217301_70"]="Subsequently, the rainy season shortened while the dry period lengthened. With reduced snowmelt, the landscape became significantly barren along their route.",
  ["100217301_71"]="Once-flowing streams dried up into riverbeds, and previously lush meadows transformed into desolate wastelands.",
  ["100217301_72"]="At that moment, Xin believed this was just the beginning of the summer rains.",
  ["100217301_73"]="Despite the intense heat, the anticipated rainfall would eventually nourish the land.",
  ["100217301_74"]="However, what followed was not the sweet rain, but famine.",
  ["100217301_75"]="Dad, another wolf got into the sheepfold last time.",
  ["100217301_76"]="I tried scaring it off with a stick, but it still managed to snatch one...",
  ["100217301_77"]="Those beasts have been so hungry that they've lost their fear of people.",
  ["100217301_78"]="Next time you face something like that, Xin, come get us. Don't try to handle it alone.",
  ["100217301_79"]="Why go through all that trouble...? Even if they're not scared of people anymore, they're still afraid of fire, right?",
  ["100217301_8"]="As she grew elder, her mother made shoes for her, allowing her to accompany the sheep as they roamed the mountains.",
  ["100217301_80"]="Can't we use fire to scare them off, like we did before?",
  ["100217301_81"]="Her father only offered her a wry smile.",
  ["100217301_82"]="Don't light a fire, Xin. That could attract something much more dangerous than wolves.",
  ["100217301_83"]="At that time, she did not fully grasp what her father meant by \"something much more dangerous than wolves.\"",
  ["100217301_84"]="She silently endured the pangs of hunger, persisting in her journey.",
  ["100217301_85"]="Despite the desolation of the West Pole, it offered vast expanses capable of containing all sorrows...",
  ["100217301_86"]="As long as she kept moving forward, the answer would eventually become clear.",
  ["100217301_87"]="...That was Xin's steadfast belief at that time.",
  ["100217301_88"]="However, in the Western Region, the seasons remained fixed like an unyielding millstone, stuck in that dry, warm winter, refusing to change.",
  ["100217301_89"]="The famine, stemming from the drought, gradually materialized in various forms.",
  ["100217301_9"]="From the wilderness to the peaks, from river valleys to meadows.",
  ["100217301_90"]="At times, it presented as silence.",
  ["100217301_91"]="Hello? Is anyone there?",
  ["100217301_92"]="We'd like to trade something...",
  ["100217301_93"]="Receiving no response, Xin cautiously pushed the wooden door.",
  ["100217301_94"]="However, all she encountered was the aftermath of a ransacked house and traces of dried blood.",
  ["100217301_95"]="...",
  ["100217301_96"]="This family...",
  ["100217301_97"]="At times, it emerged as pleas.",
  ["100217301_98"]="Please...",
  ["100217301_99"]="Don't leave... please...",
  ["100217401_10"]="We gave her some medicine and talked for a while, but she hasn't woken up yet...",
  ["100217401_11"]="Placing my hand on Xiaoyun's forehead, I note a slight improvement, but her fever persists.",
  ["100217401_12"]="The medicines here can only do so much.",
  ["100217401_13"]="To really help her, we'll need some fever reducers.",
  ["100217401_14"]="Fever reducers... That shouldn't be a problem. There's a hospital nearby.",
  ["100217401_15"]="Just wait here. I'll be back in a moment!",
  ["100217401_16"]="Hold on.",
  ["100217401_17"]="Do you know what fever reducers look like?",
  ["100217401_18"]="O-of course I do!",
  ["100217401_19"]="It's like... a box labeled \"fever reducers\"...?",
  ["100217401_2"]="Xin and Xiaoyun",
  ["100217401_20"]="But then again, what do the words \"fever reducers\" even look like?",
  ["100217401_21"]="...I should go with you.",
  ["100217401_22"]="Let's make sure you don't end up bringing the wrong medicine.",
  ["100217401_23"]="Alright, come along.",
  ["100217401_24"]="The evacuation zone is a mess thanks to the Cerulean Blight. There are likely to be tons of frenzied beasts along the way... We can't risk leading them to Xiaoyun's house. Stick with me and let's try not to stir them up.",
  ["100217401_3"]="Xin's words lack sorrow or hatred; they resonate with a strange serenity.",
  ["100217401_4"]="It feels as if the girl who had witnessed the death of her most cherished ones is not herself but some fictional character in a distant tale.",
  ["100217401_5"]="Hey, why are you giving me that look?",
  ["100217401_6"]="It's all water under the bridge... And look, I've been doing well since Qing brought me here, right?",
  ["100217401_7"]="I have enough to eat. Just need to put up with a bit of nagging now and then.",
  ["100217401_8"]="Leaving these words, Xin shifts her gaze to Xiaoyun on the bed.",
  ["100217401_9"]="Let's not dwell on that... By the way, how is Xiaoyun doing?",
  ["100217402_1"]="After overcoming various challenges, we eventually find the fever reducers at the hospital.",
  ["100217402_10"]="The girl lying in bed shakes her head.",
  ["100217402_11"]="It's not, sister Xin...",
  ["100217402_12"]="I just remembered... someone outside was advising everyone to evacuate... I need to hurry over there.",
  ["100217402_13"]="I must move... Mom and Dad always said not to be a burden on others...",
  ["100217402_14"]="Don't worry about that now! You're a patient, and your focus should be on getting better.",
  ["100217402_15"]="Plus, it's already nighttime. The people handling evacuations have likely called it a day.",
  ["100217402_16"]="Only then does Xiaoyun notice the twinkling stars outside.",
  ["100217402_17"]="Ohh... have I been asleep all this time?",
  ["100217402_18"]="Don't fret! When I fell ill, I slept a whole day and night, waking up only when Qing arrived and nudged me awake with her paintbrush...",
  ["100217402_19"]="Anyway, don't stress about it now. We'll get you to the evacuation spot in the morning.",
  ["100217402_2"]="With all the beasts drawn to the hospital, our return is almost unimpeded.",
  ["100217402_20"]="Yeah...",
  ["100217402_21"]="Upon hearing Xin's reassurance, Xiaoyun quietly retreats beneath the covers.",
  ["100217402_22"]="Sister Xin...",
  ["100217402_23"]="Can you tell me a bedtime story like you used to?",
  ["100217402_24"]="Ah, a bedtime story...",
  ["100217402_25"]="Xin casts a helpless glance at me and blinks repeatedly.",
  ["100217402_26"]="Judging from her expression, it likely conveys, \"Just come up with something!\"",
  ["100217402_27"]="As I reflect on the challenges I have faced, a story begins to take shape in my mind.",
  ["100217402_28"]="I'll tell you one.",
  ["100217402_29"]="It's a story of saving a tower across time and space.",
  ["100217402_3"]="Upon our return to Peace Community, we administer the fever reducers to Xiaoyun.",
  ["100217402_30"]="It's a tale of traveling back to the past and search for the sun.",
  ["100217402_31"]="Although I don't fully understand it, it sounds like a good one...",
  ["100217402_32"]="And then what happened? Did they repair the tower? And where did the Seer go?",
  ["100217402_33"]="I thought these tales would swiftly lull Xiaoyun to sleep.",
  ["100217402_34"]="Yet, to my surprise, even as my throat grows dry, her eyes remain bright with curiosity, eager for more content.",
  ["100217402_35"]="That's where the tale ends...",
  ["100217402_36"]="Can... can you tell me another story? I want to hear more!",
  ["100217402_37"]="Yeah, yeah! Tell us more! What happened to the giant and the sun in the tower?",
  ["100217402_38"]="Xin...",
  ["100217402_39"]="Hey, are you a kid at heart too?",
  ["100217402_4"]="Under Xin's attentive care, Xiaoyun's condition significantly improves. Seeing this, I release a sigh of relief and settle into a seat.",
  ["100217402_40"]="Ahaha...",
  ["100217402_41"]="Sorry, I got too carried away with the story...",
  ["100217402_42"]="Well then, I'll share another story.",
  ["100217402_43"]="It's a story about... the wilderness, yeah!",
  ["100217402_44"]="Xin clears her throat and gazes out of the window.",
  ["100217402_45"]="Back then, I was in the Western Region, around the same age as you are now...",
  ["100217402_5"]="By the time Xiaoyun awakens, night has already fallen.",
  ["100217402_6"]="Sister Xin...",
  ["100217402_7"]="And your friend?",
  ["100217402_8"]="Xiaoyun extends her hand, seemingly attempting to rise from the bed.",
  ["100217402_9"]="Hey, take it easy... Just lay down on the bed and rest up... If you feel hungry or thirsty, just give us a shout.",
  ["100217501_1"]="First Encounter with Tiaohua",
  ["100217501_10"]="At that moment, a rustle of fabric through the underbrush interrupted her.",
  ["100217501_100"]="Xin, you mentioned you're from a herdsman family. Have you ever ridden a horse?",
  ["100217501_101"]="No, horses are rarer than sheep and cows. They're not as easy to come by.",
  ["100217501_102"]="They eat a lot but don't give wool or meat like sheep or cows... My dad never bothered with them.",
  ["100217501_103"]="I used to sneak off to the sheepfold and pick a sturdy sheep to ride in my free time, and in the end...",
  ["100217501_104"]="You learned to ride?",
  ["100217501_105"]="No, all the sheep became aware of me and would trot up whenever they saw me.",
  ["100217501_106"]="Haha! You're quite the character, sister Xin...",
  ["100217501_107"]="Apart from cattle and sheep, we had an orchard of autumn pears near our house, but they all went to waste over the years... I wonder how those trees are doing now.",
  ["100217501_108"]="Autumn pears... How are they different from regular pears?",
  ["100217501_109"]="They're sweet with a touch of sourness... If I get the chance, I'll get some for you to taste!",
  ["100217501_11"]="She halted her movements, fixating her gaze on the withered grass with the intensity of a beast.",
  ["100217501_110"]="Yeah... Thank you, sister Xin.",
  ["100217501_111"]="On sunny days, Tiaohua would occasionally retrieve books from the ash-covered goods.",
  ["100217501_112"]="During these moments, Xin would always wear a puzzled expression.",
  ["100217501_113"]="What's this? A... book? Will it fetch a good price, too?",
  ["100217501_114"]="When we went to the east to restock, I got these books from some good people at the Bureau of Health & Welfare. They said kids in other regions loved this \"I Wonder Why\" series.",
  ["100217501_115"]="I have a few extra copies here. Want to read them, sister Xin?",
  ["100217501_116"]="Nah, I'll pass. I can't read.",
  ["100217501_117"]="Don't worry. I'll read them for you.",
  ["100217501_118"]="No, stop it! I just hate books...",
  ["100217501_119"]="So... with these \"drought-resistant crops,\" even if it doesn't rain for a month, the fields can still yield crops?",
  ["100217501_12"]="Relax, it's just me.",
  ["100217501_120"]="With Tiaohua's gentle persuasion, Xin eventually gave up her resistance and approached the books with curiosity.",
  ["100217501_121"]="It's not just that! Look here, it says under certain conditions, you can launch shells into the sky to trigger rainfall! They call it \"artificial rainfall.\"",
  ["100217501_122"]="Once the path is clear, they'll bring in these supplies.",
  ["100217501_123"]="I don't quite get it...",
  ["100217501_124"]="Anyway, does it mean everyone will have clothes and food?",
  ["100217501_125"]="Yeah, the good people in CangLin City told us that...",
  ["100217501_126"]="*Cough* *Cough*...",
  ["100217501_127"]="Tiaohua's contemplation of the future was abruptly interrupted by a violent cough.",
  ["100217501_128"]="Tiaohua?! Are you okay...?",
  ["100217501_129"]="Concerned for Tiaohua, Xin hurried to her side, patting her back, yet Tiaohua's cough persisted.",
  ["100217501_13"]="It's market day today, and I've come to collect pelts from you.",
  ["100217501_130"]="The carriage halted, and the merchant, wearing an impatient expression, retrieved the medication and handed it to Tiaohua.",
  ["100217501_131"]="After taking the medicine, Tiaohua rested for a while until her breathing stabilized.",
  ["100217501_132"]="Come on, you money-loser! Why are you falling ill again?",
  ["100217501_133"]="We still have a week's journey to the village out west. We don't have much time, and you're still here fiddling with those useless papers?",
  ["100217501_134"]="Just get better soon and take my place, money-loser!",
  ["100217501_135"]="Upon hearing this, Xin clenched her teeth in indignation.",
  ["100217501_136"]="Money-loser?",
  ["100217501_137"]="She's your daughter! What does money have to do with anything?",
  ["100217501_138"]="Huh? You have quite the nerve, you little bandit! She's my daughter, and it's none of your business what I call her!",
  ["100217501_139"]="Since when did pelt hunters poke their noses into others' family business?",
  ["100217501_14"]="The various parcels behind the merchant eased the girl's wariness.",
  ["100217501_140"]="You...!",
  ["100217501_141"]="Just as Xin teetered on the edge of losing her temper, Tiaohua stepped in between them, shaking her head.",
  ["100217501_142"]="Silently, she walked to the front and took hold of the reins.",
  ["100217501_143"]="At that moment, Xin suddenly realized the state of Tiaohua's health.",
  ["100217501_144"]="The journey had been challenging, and whenever the night grew cold or temperatures dropped, Tiaohua would suffer from recurring coughing spells.",
  ["100217501_145"]="Despite this, the merchant showed no concern. Instead, he frequently compelled Tiaohua to take the reins, exposing her to the elements.",
  ["100217501_146"]="From hair color to personality traits and speech patterns, Tiaohua and the merchant appeared to have little in common... Reflecting on these observations, Xin began to realize something.",
  ["100217501_147"]="Seizing a brief moment of respite, she called out to the merchant.",
  ["100217501_148"]="Hey, there's something I want to ask you.",
  ["100217501_149"]="What's the deal between Tiaohua and you? Are you two related?",
  ["100217501_15"]="The mountain paths in the Western Region were inaccessible by carriage, relying heavily on traveling merchants to facilitate the exchange of goods among villages.",
  ["100217501_150"]="With a \"tsk,\" the merchant responded.",
  ["100217501_151"]="I'm her father, of course! What other relationship could there be?",
  ["100217501_152"]="You're her father, but you don't care if she's doing well and call her money-loser?",
  ["100217501_153"]="You... snatched her from another family, didn't you?",
  ["100217501_154"]="Initially taken aback, the merchant quickly reverted to his cunning demeanor.",
  ["100217501_155"]="Snatch? Oh, now you're laying all the blame on me, huh?",
  ["100217501_156"]="Back then, it was her parents kneeling before me, saying their daughter was smart and educated, asking me to take her so she could have a better life.",
  ["100217501_157"]="I thought she could help with my accounts, so I agreed.",
  ["100217501_158"]="But guess what? My good intentions were wasted. They told me nothing about her illness! They handed over a sick girl who coughs all the time! Wouldn't you call her a money-loser?",
  ["100217501_159"]="You're from a herdsman family, right? If you bought a sick sheep from a seller, you'd call it a money-loser too, wouldn't you?",
  ["100217501_16"]="During the first three days of autumn, traveling merchants frequented this area to gather pelts.",
  ["100217501_160"]="But Tiaohua is no livestock! Don't try to equate the two!",
  ["100217501_161"]="I'm covering all her bills, and now I can't even complain about her?!",
  ["100217501_162"]="You...",
  ["100217501_163"]="As darkness descended and coughs continued to resonate from the front of the carriage, the merchant cursed and took over from Tiaohua at the reins.",
  ["100217501_164"]="Upon returning to the carriage, Tiaohua was met by Xin's somber expression.",
  ["100217501_165"]="Sister Xin, did you and Dad... have an argument?",
  ["100217501_166"]="Dad?",
  ["100217501_167"]="You're still calling him \"Dad\" after how he's been treating you?!",
  ["100217501_168"]="I see... You've figured it out, sister Xin...",
  ["100217501_169"]="My father used to scold me, and even beat me up... But even in the hardest times, he made every effort to keep me well-fed! And he never called me a money-loser.",
  ["100217501_17"]="Everything is ready here.",
  ["100217501_170"]="You know what? That man is a bastard... and your parents are cruel to entrust you to such scum.",
  ["100217501_171"]="Without a word, Tiaohua quietly settled beside Xin.",
  ["100217501_172"]="I was so young when I was sent away. Now that I think of it, I don't remember much about my mom and dad.",
  ["100217501_173"]="But even so, I remember how hard they worked every day just to keep my brother and me fed and sheltered.",
  ["100217501_174"]="Farming, trading, pawning, begging... They did everything they could for us.",
  ["100217501_175"]="I know... those were tough years for everyone...",
  ["100217501_176"]="Upon hearing this, Xin lowered her head.",
  ["100217501_177"]="I think... my mom and dad sent me away because they were desperate... They hoped I'd find a better life somewhere else.",
  ["100217501_178"]="So please, sister Xin... Don't speak ill of them...",
  ["100217501_179"]="...",
  ["100217501_18"]="Bring me what I need, and the pelts are yours.",
  ["100217501_180"]="Suppressing tears, Tiaohua managed a smile.",
  ["100217501_181"]="So I don't blame my parents, or that merchant, or you, sister Xin...",
  ["100217501_182"]="This harsh world left us no choice but to live like this...",
  ["100217501_19"]="Where's my stuff?",
  ["100217501_2"]="The Western Region is notorious for its treacherous terrain.",
  ["100217501_20"]="The traveling merchant narrowed his eyes, inspecting the pelts on the stakes before retrieving a stitched bag from his belongings.",
  ["100217501_21"]="The bulges in the bag suggested it was roughly half full.",
  ["100217501_22"]="Hey, this isn't the deal we agreed on!",
  ["100217501_23"]="Didn't we settle on a whole bag of grain?",
  ["100217501_24"]="Nah, market prices have gone up.",
  ["100217501_25"]="The Western Path got blocked by rocks a few days back, and it's still impassable.",
  ["100217501_26"]="No goods are coming in, and I have to adjust my prices accordingly... So, naturally, your pelts are now worth only half a bag of grain.",
  ["100217501_27"]="You merchants... Promise one thing, and deliver another.",
  ["100217501_28"]="You think you can suddenly change the terms like this?",
  ["100217501_29"]="Xin arched her eyebrows.",
  ["100217501_3"]="Following the drought, the Bureau of Health & Welfare promptly allocated resources from all regions to assist the Western Region.",
  ["100217501_30"]="Alright, I've got a story for you too.",
  ["100217501_31"]="The beasts in these mountains scattered a few days ago. I couldn't find much prey here... So naturally, I'll have to raise my prices.",
  ["100217501_32"]="As for the price hike... Well, it just covers the missing grain.",
  ["100217501_33"]="Before finishing her words, Xin swiftly seized the bag from the merchant's grip.",
  ["100217501_34"]="What the heck are you doing?!",
  ["100217501_35"]="Consider this a deposit.",
  ["100217501_36"]="You want these pelts? Hand over the other bag of grain.",
  ["100217501_37"]="The merchant's expression soured as he reached for the machete at his belt.",
  ["100217501_38"]="I'm not in the mood to haggle. Give back my bag now!",
  ["100217501_39"]="Arrgh!",
  ["100217501_4"]="However, the narrow, muddy paths and hazardous mountain routes presented significant challenges.",
  ["100217501_40"]="Before his fingers could grasp the hilt, the back of his hand was sharply struck by the staff wielded by the girl.",
  ["100217501_41"]="Emitting a pained cry, the merchant staggered back, rubbing his swollen hand.",
  ["100217501_42"]="You... you!",
  ["100217501_43"]="Give back my stuff... This trade is off!",
  ["100217501_44"]="The merchant stepped back, met by two resolute steps forward from Xin, causing him to fall to the ground.",
  ["100217501_45"]="Looking up, he found the dagger affixed to the staff already before his eyes.",
  ["100217501_46"]="The trade's off? No, that won't fly.",
  ["100217501_47"]="You'll have to buy my pelts, whether you like it or not!",
  ["100217501_48"]="Now you're talking like a bandit, huh? You little scoundrel. Trying to kill me because the trade isn't going your way?!",
  ["100217501_49"]="At the mention of \"bandit,\" a hint of displeasure briefly crossed Xin's face.",
  ["100217501_5"]="Surrounded by mountains, the Western Region, in its time of need, could only rely on human effort to transport supplies.",
  ["100217501_50"]="I'm nothing like you.",
  ["100217501_51"]="Bring me what's missing, and I'll let you off.",
  ["100217501_52"]="Just as the two confronted each other, the creak of a door opening resounded from the carriage.",
  ["100217501_53"]="Upon hearing the sound, Xin halted her confrontation with the merchant, tightening her grip on her weapon.",
  ["100217501_54"]="Another hunter? Or reinforcement for the merchant? Or a genuine bandit?",
  ["100217501_55"]="She focused her gaze on the carriage, observing every movement.",
  ["100217501_56"]="Calm down, you two!",
  ["100217501_57"]="To her surprise, the person emerging from the carriage was a girl of her age.",
  ["100217501_58"]="Breathless from her sprint, she stood between Xin and the merchant.",
  ["100217501_59"]="Let's talk this out... No need for violence...",
  ["100217501_6"]="Despite their efforts, the threat of famine still loomed over the land.",
  ["100217501_60"]="We'll find a way to make up for the missing items for you, sister Xin!",
  ["100217501_61"]="Well...",
  ["100217501_62"]="So, your dad wasn't fibbing? The road to the eastern mountain is really wrecked?",
  ["100217501_63"]="Yeah, rocks blocked the road. No supplies could make it in.",
  ["100217501_64"]="We went through a few villages but couldn't gather what we promised you...",
  ["100217501_65"]="I'm truly sorry about that...",
  ["100217501_66"]="To make amends for the goods, we can give you a ride, sister Xin... We're heading west for business anyway.",
  ["100217501_67"]="Not just a ride. You'll have to provide my food and drinks along the way.",
  ["100217501_68"]="With a cold intensity, Xin's gaze swept over the girl in the carriage.",
  ["100217501_69"]="In contrast to the shrewd merchant who often squinted, the girl's eyes revealed no hint of suspicion or deceit.",
  ["100217501_7"]="In the eastern part of the Western Region, beyond the desolate expanse...",
  ["100217501_70"]="This distinct difference left Xin somewhat surprised.",
  ["100217501_71"]="Well, but then again...",
  ["100217501_72"]="Aren't you scared to invite me into your carriage?",
  ["100217501_73"]="What's there to fear, sister Xin?",
  ["100217501_74"]="You know? To get these pelts, I hunted around the mountain for a whole week... but all I got in return was a bag of grain.",
  ["100217501_75"]="Now this carriage holds many more things more precious than grain.",
  ["100217501_76"]="Aren't you worried I might kill you both while your dad is driving and snatch all the goods?",
  ["100217501_77"]="No, I'm not.",
  ["100217501_78"]="With a composed demeanor, the girl continued to organize the pelts.",
  ["100217501_79"]="All the pelts you gave us are neatly cut and dried with care, sister Xin... I've met my fair share of hunters, none as meticulous as you.",
  ["100217501_8"]="A red-haired figure was skillfully processing her recent hunt with a rudimentary dagger.",
  ["100217501_80"]="I can tell you genuinely wanted to trade fairly with us. You had no intention of forcing us to buy your pelts.",
  ["100217501_81"]="...",
  ["100217501_82"]="Her sincere reaction left Xin flustered.",
  ["100217501_83"]="H-hey, I'm not as kind as you think...",
  ["100217501_84"]="I was just bored waiting for you, so I worked on that leather just to pass the time.",
  ["100217501_85"]="But you know, all the hunters we met traveled in groups. It's rare to meet someone like you traveling solo.",
  ["100217501_86"]="Sister Xin, aren't you worried you might run into... bad people?",
  ["100217501_87"]="Bad people? Heh, they're just a bunch of hungry and desperate folks.",
  ["100217501_88"]="If I run into them, I'll just play the bandit and beat them at their own game!",
  ["100217501_89"]="Even the tough folks back off when they see you mean business, just like how your dad chickens out when faced with really tough ones.",
  ["100217501_9"]="Though dulled with use, the blade moved with the precision of a scalpel in her hands, expertly dissecting the beast.",
  ["100217501_90"]="Sister Xin...",
  ["100217501_91"]="Have you always been living like this?",
  ["100217501_92"]="Yeah, it's simple: sheep eat grass, and wolves eat sheep. That's just how it goes out here.",
  ["100217501_93"]="So, sister Xin... Are you a sheep or a wolf?",
  ["100217501_94"]="Confronted by the girl's earnest gaze, Xin found herself at a loss for words.",
  ["100217501_95"]="After a brief pause, she looked away as if searching for an escape.",
  ["100217501_96"]="...I don't really mind.",
  ["100217501_97"]="As long as I'm not the one getting eaten, I'm good.",
  ["100217501_98"]="Perhaps the rugged mountain path offered little excitement, or perhaps encounters with peers were infrequent...",
  ["100217501_99"]="Following that evening, Xin gradually opened up to Tiaohua, engaging in occasional conversations with her.",
  ["100217601_1"]="Desperate Attempt",
  ["100217601_10"]="You risked it all to save Xiaoyun...",
  ["100217601_11"]="It's all tied to those memories, right?",
  ["100217601_12"]="Yeah, maybe... Maybe I just can't bear to see my friend all alone like Tiaohua was, so I acted before I could think of anything else.",
  ["100217601_13"]="Besides, over all these years, I've gotten used to handling problems on my own.",
  ["100217601_14"]="Speaking of this, Xin's eyes darkened slightly.",
  ["100217601_15"]="How can I be certain that others won't let me down?",
  ["100217601_16"]="What if they were like those villagers, just standing by and doing nothing?",
  ["100217601_17"]="Or maybe like that scum, never paying any attention to Tiaohua's suffering...",
  ["100217601_18"]="You know they're not like that.",
  ["100217601_19"]="Yeah, I... I know it for sure.",
  ["100217601_2"]="When Xin finishes her story, it is already late into the night.",
  ["100217601_20"]="Despite the frenzied beasts, they arrived early in the morning, risking their own lives. They can't be bad people.",
  ["100217601_21"]="Reflecting on this, Xin crosses her arms, leaning against the wall.",
  ["100217601_22"]="I just...",
  ["100217601_23"]="I just don't want to experience something like... what happened to Mom, Dad, and Tiaohua again.",
  ["100217601_24"]="Rather than rely on others, I'd prefer to handle things with my own hands.",
  ["100217601_25"]="But sooner or later, you'll meet problems that you can't handle on your own.",
  ["100217601_26"]="But sooner or later, you'll have to rely on others for support.",
  ["100217601_27"]="Xin appears contemplative upon hearing my words, though not entirely in agreement.",
  ["100217601_28"]="That makes sense... but we haven't run into anything like that, right?",
  ["100217601_29"]="No worries, if things get really tricky, I'll turn to people I trust for help.",
  ["100217601_3"]="Xiaoyun drifted into asleep listening to just half of it. Now, her peaceful breathing fills the serene room.",
  ["100217601_30"]="By the way, I've got something more important to tell you.",
  ["100217601_31"]="We can't follow the same way back. We've got to take a detour.",
  ["100217601_32"]="Because of those barricades?",
  ["100217601_33"]="Exactly. By this time, the exit for this block is already sealed off. If we head back, we'll be stuck outside the gate.",
  ["100217601_34"]="But Qing mentioned a backup route when I left...",
  ["100217601_35"]="It's located at the intersections.",
  ["100217601_36"]="We'll head out at dawn tomorrow.",
  ["100217601_4"]="Phew, she's finally asleep...",
  ["100217601_5"]="While the story is finished, Xin's words lingers in my mind.",
  ["100217601_6"]="The slim figure wandering through the wilderness in my thoughts starts to merge with the girl before me.",
  ["100217601_7"]="What happened later?",
  ["100217601_8"]="Why are you still dwelling on the past?",
  ["100217601_9"]="Like I said, it's water under the bridge. Why bother delving into it?",
  ["100217602_1"]="The Cerulean Crystals lining the road resemble towering forests emerging from the earth, obstructing the path ahead.",
  ["100217602_2"]="Their hue mirrors aged patina, blocking the route to the exit.",
  ["100217602_3"]="Noticing her companions have already escaped, Xin sighs in relief, despite being left alone.",
  ["100217602_4"]="Heh, this feels oddly familiar, like deja vu...",
  ["100217602_5"]="This is not the first time she has risked her life trying to rescue someone.",
  ["100217602_6"]="In Xin's vision, the two figures running away gradually overlap with the figure in her memory unfolding at sunrise on an autumn day.",
  ["100217701_1"]="An Escape at Night",
  ["100217701_10"]="Those figures, gripping their farming tools, fixed their gaze on the carriage following the traveling merchant.",
  ["100217701_100"]="Tiaohua, concealed herself in an old hut, cautiously peered out of the window.",
  ["100217701_101"]="The figures seemed to search for something.",
  ["100217701_102"]="Her \"dad\" had promised to return for her after loading the carriage, instructing her to pacify the villagers with the grain in the bag.",
  ["100217701_103"]="However, only half the bag held grain. When the villagers discovered the hidden stone, their expressions turned horrifying.",
  ["100217701_104"]="Were it not for the cover of the night, Tiaohua might not have made it into this hut.",
  ["100217701_105"]="Were the words from her \"dad\" a pledge or a deception? The truth had already revealed itself.",
  ["100217701_106"]="The noises... they're getting closer...",
  ["100217701_107"]="Outside, the initially coaxing and indistinct sounds escalated into angry curses and the noise of rummaging.",
  ["100217701_108"]="Memories of the night she was sent away flooded her mind.",
  ["100217701_109"]="Mom, dad... and brother...",
  ["100217701_11"]="Damn it! They never planned to buy the grain... They're setting up an ambush for food!",
  ["100217701_110"]="I don't want to be left alone anymore...",
  ["100217701_111"]="Thoughts of the villagers' gazes brought tears of fear to her eyes.",
  ["100217701_112"]="The commotion outside the hut intensified, hinting at an imminent encirclement.",
  ["100217701_113"]="Just at that moment, a resounding sound of hooves pierced the air.",
  ["100217701_114"]="The hoofbeats were clear and purposeful, resembling a carriage yet more definitive.",
  ["100217701_115"]="Accompanying the sounds was a familiar voice.",
  ["100217701_116"]="Are you there, Tiaohua? Shout if you can hear me!",
  ["100217701_117"]="Sister Xin!",
  ["100217701_118"]="Mustering her courage, Tiaohua pushed open the gate.",
  ["100217701_119"]="Almost simultaneously, the red-haired girl noticed the shout and swiftly rode towards the hut.",
  ["100217701_12"]="Xin tightened her grip on her weapon and swiftly scanned the villagers around. In the moonlight, she faintly discerned their fatigued faces.",
  ["100217701_120"]="Grab my hand!",
  ["100217701_121"]="Taking hold of Tiaohua's trembling arm, she lifted her onto the horse's back with a strong tug.",
  ["100217701_122"]="Sister Xin, the path ahead is blocked... The villagers are gathering there! The carriage... it's going to tip!",
  ["100217701_123"]="Don't worry. I have a plan to get through!",
  ["100217701_124"]="Xin adjusted the carriage's course and cut the rope connecting the carriage, sending the laden box flying backward.",
  ["100217701_125"]="Bags of various sizes spilled to the ground with a splash. Observing this scene, the villagers, who had formed a human barrier, eagerly rushed toward the scattered goods.",
  ["100217701_126"]="The horse, unburdened, hastened its pace, soon vanishing into the night.",
  ["100217701_127"]="Silence prevailed during their escape.",
  ["100217701_128"]="Only the rustle of the wind and the steady rhythm of the horse's hooves accompanied them.",
  ["100217701_129"]="After a prolonged silence, Tiaohua finally broke the quietness.",
  ["100217701_13"]="Their gaunt features lacked vitality. Famine had taken its toll on these people.",
  ["100217701_130"]="Why, sister Xin...?",
  ["100217701_131"]="Why are you risking so much to help me...?",
  ["100217701_132"]="Because I made a promise to you.",
  ["100217701_133"]="I promised to take you to my hometown to taste the autumn pears. How could I break that promise?",
  ["100217701_134"]="Just because of that? But you left an entire carriage of cargo behind...",
  ["100217701_135"]="Whether it's half a carriage or a full one, it doesn't matter to me... Math was never my strong suit, you know!",
  ["100217701_136"]="Anyway, I wouldn't leave you there alone... I know how tough it is to be left alone.",
  ["100217701_137"]="Don't call yourself a \"money-loser\" anymore... I traded a whole load of goods just for you!",
  ["100217701_138"]="You're as daring as ever, sister Xin...",
  ["100217701_139"]="But hey, I didn't drop everything yet.",
  ["100217701_14"]="Well, desperate times call for desperate measures... Maybe you pushed them too hard with your prices last time.",
  ["100217701_140"]="Xin proudly patted the bag on the horse's back.",
  ["100217701_141"]="I kept a bag for us. Yeah, the bag of grain I traded for pelts.",
  ["100217701_142"]="If you have somewhere in mind, just say the word. We have enough food to share on the journey.",
  ["100217701_143"]="I... don't really have a destination.",
  ["100217701_144"]="I've messed up everything. I can't return to the merchant... I have nowhere to go now.",
  ["100217701_145"]="But maybe... just maybe...",
  ["100217701_146"]="Tiaohua paused briefly, as if recalling something.",
  ["100217701_147"]="I want... I want to find my mom, dad, and brother.",
  ["100217701_148"]="Your mom and dad, right?",
  ["100217701_149"]="A blend of regret and nostalgia welled in Xin's eyes.",
  ["100217701_15"]="Why not just give them the grain to ensure a safe exit?",
  ["100217701_150"]="Okay, let's go together. Tell me where you live.",
  ["100217701_151"]="If I remember correctly, we need to take a mountain road from the east side of the mountain...",
  ["100217701_152"]="Another dawn broke.",
  ["100217701_153"]="Xin raised her head slightly, the pale golden light akin to ripe rice cresting the horizon, illuminating her face... This time, it felt unusually warm.",
  ["100217701_154"]="Yeah, you're right, dad.",
  ["100217701_155"]="Now... I've finally found my own path.",
  ["100217701_156"]="Except this one truth, nothing in this wasteland could keep her in restrain.",
  ["100217701_157"]="The land beneath her resembled the herding trail she once set foot on - silent, desolate, with no trees nor soil to be seen.",
  ["100217701_158"]="But somehow... something put her at ease, like the long await reunion.",
  ["100217701_159"]="She held Tiaohua's hand and kept on walking toward the sun... as weightless as a passing breeze.",
  ["100217701_16"]="No chance!",
  ["100217701_17"]="If they find out about the goods on this carriage, we won't be able to leave at all... You might slip away, but I definitely won't.",
  ["100217701_18"]="Heh, if you're feeling daring, feel free to make a run for it. Let's see who's faster, your cargo-laden horse, or those hungry villagers.",
  ["100217701_19"]="Observing the gathering figures, the merchant grits his teeth.",
  ["100217701_2"]="It had been a week since Xin joined Tiaohua on the journey.",
  ["100217701_20"]="If they block our path, we're trapped... Damn it! Guess I'll have to do this.",
  ["100217701_21"]="Hey, money-loser! Come help me unload the grain from the carriage... I'll take it to those outlaws.",
  ["100217701_22"]="And you, get on the carriage. While I'm busy with the grain, you make a quiet getaway. And keep those goods hidden!",
  ["100217701_23"]="Why do I have to help you?",
  ["100217701_24"]="Because if you don't, that money-loser girl will end up driving the carriage, and if she starts coughing midway...",
  ["100217701_25"]="Xin pursed her lips tightly. Indeed, that was an undeniable reason.",
  ["100217701_26"]="...Fine, I'll help for Tiaohua's sake.",
  ["100217701_27"]="But just to be clear, I've never driven a carriage before, so don't blame me if it tips over.",
  ["100217701_28"]="You get in the carriage first. I have something to discuss with that money... with Tiaohua.",
  ["100217701_29"]="Sister Xin...",
  ["100217701_3"]="Venturing westward, the land along the road became increasingly barren, and the price of grain surged.",
  ["100217701_30"]="Are you done talking to that guy?",
  ["100217701_31"]="Yeah, we've done talking...",
  ["100217701_32"]="Thank you for looking after me these days, sister Xin...",
  ["100217701_33"]="I... I...",
  ["100217701_34"]="Tiaohua's voice gradually faded into a murmur resembling sobs.",
  ["100217701_35"]="Hey, it's okay. I'm here.",
  ["100217701_36"]="Those people aren't bandits. They're just hungry and desperate... That guy can handle it.",
  ["100217701_37"]="Head back to the carriage and rest up. We'll be moving soon.",
  ["100217701_38"]="Soon, a heavy footstep resonated from the rear of the carriage, causing the wooden board to creak under pressure.",
  ["100217701_39"]="The abrupt sound starkly contrasted with Tiaohua's typical light steps.",
  ["100217701_4"]="Hence, the merchant transported the grain from the east to the villages west of the mountains.",
  ["100217701_40"]="She must be really tense...",
  ["100217701_41"]="Xin reached a conclusion without lingering on it.",
  ["100217701_42"]="Once the creaking ceased, she took hold of the reins and urged the horse forward.",
  ["100217701_43"]="The journey progressed more smoothly than Xin had expected.",
  ["100217701_44"]="Despite a few villagers noticing the unusual scene, the carriage continued without hindrance.",
  ["100217701_45"]="Soon, the village disappeared into the distance.",
  ["100217701_46"]="Phew, this ride is rough...",
  ["100217701_47"]="Want to stop for a break, Tiaohua? They won't catch up at this distance.",
  ["100217701_48"]="Tiaohua...?",
  ["100217701_49"]="Despite Xin's questions, the carriage remained silent.",
  ["100217701_5"]="However, upon reaching the village, they were met with a desolate scene under the veil of night.",
  ["100217701_50"]="The howling wind filled Xin's ears, stirring a sense of foreboding.",
  ["100217701_51"]="Tiaohua had been unusually quiet, unresponsive to Xin's questions, not even coughing.",
  ["100217701_52"]="Realizing that something was amiss, Xin abruptly yanked the reins.",
  ["100217701_53"]="The carriage came to a sudden stop, accompanied by the horse's neighs, clatter of goods, and a shout.",
  ["100217701_54"]="Ugh...",
  ["100217701_55"]="The merchant, concealed among the cargo, tumbled out onto the ground.",
  ["100217701_56"]="Recalling the sudden departure, Tiaohua's farewell, and the strange creaking inside the carriage, Xin pieced together the truth.",
  ["100217701_57"]="Fueled by fury, she dismounted and pressed her dagger against the merchant's neck.",
  ["100217701_58"]="You! Why are you doing this?!",
  ["100217701_59"]="It should have been evident earlier. How could a calculated merchant, known for haggling over pelts, endanger himself in such a manner?",
  ["100217701_6"]="Huh? What's going on here? Last time I checked, they had enough food for a month... Why is their village empty now?",
  ["100217701_60"]="Truth is, the merchant had swapped places with Tiaohua when Xin took the reins, leaving her to face the villagers alone.",
  ["100217701_61"]="Why? Because my cargo is more precious than that money-loser!",
  ["100217701_62"]="I've shelled out a fortune just to get doctors for her, so why must I keep her around now?",
  ["100217701_63"]="She's been with you for years! And you're just ditching her like unwanted cargo?!",
  ["100217701_64"]="If I hadn't taken her in, that money-loser would have died of starvation or sickness! She knew that, so she chose to stay there!",
  ["100217701_65"]="You scum!",
  ["100217701_66"]="Gritting her teeth, Xin sheathed her dagger and sprinted towards the carriage. Killing the merchant there would only sully her weapon with his blood fouler than any beast's.",
  ["100217701_67"]="Are you out of your mind?!",
  ["100217701_68"]="We got out of the village by fooling them! If they see you back, they'll take everything! They might even keep you there!",
  ["100217701_69"]="While the merchant's words held a deceptive edge, they carried a logical weight. Returning unharmed would prove challenging for Xin.",
  ["100217701_7"]="Hold on, there are still footprints here. Could it be...?",
  ["100217701_70"]="Noting Xin's hesitation, the merchant resumed his cunning demeanor.",
  ["100217701_71"]="How long have you known that money-loser? Five days? Or a week...? You're not even friends, right? Is it worth risking everything?",
  ["100217701_72"]="I know you've lost your parents and been wandering. You've seen what this place is like, right?",
  ["100217701_73"]="Do you think I've never wanted to do good things and help others? I've shared grain with refugees and taken in kids like Tiaohua.",
  ["100217701_74"]="And you know what happened? Those scoundrels eyed my supplies! Once they were fed, they tried to rob me! And those parents tried to take advantage of my kindness! They dumped their sick kids, ones they couldn't save, on me!",
  ["100217701_75"]="Your parents, I imagine, faced a similar fate, huh?",
  ["100217701_76"]="...",
  ["100217701_77"]="Xin bowed her head, offering no rebuttal.",
  ["100217701_78"]="Well, how about we settle it like this?",
  ["100217701_79"]="You let me go. Then you can take whatever you need from my carriage, and we're even.",
  ["100217701_8"]="At that moment, the sound of footsteps trailed behind them.",
  ["100217701_80"]="Xin glanced at the carriage.",
  ["100217701_81"]="The cargo in the carriage was enough to help her endure the drought.",
  ["100217701_82"]="A few bags could spare her from the struggle of fighting feral beasts for sustenance.",
  ["100217701_83"]="Yet, the fate of Tiaohua lingered as an unanswered question.",
  ["100217701_84"]="Reflecting on this, Xin chuckled unexpectedly.",
  ["100217701_85"]="Perhaps it's just as what he said: Sheep eat grass, and wolves eat sheep. It's just how things are out here...",
  ["100217701_86"]="So, even if I go for more excessive actions, it's quite natural here, isn't it?",
  ["100217701_87"]="With a mocking laugh, Xin withdrew the dagger from her staff, her gaze turning cold.",
  ["100217701_88"]="What do you say? If you keep hesitating, I'll withdraw my offer.",
  ["100217701_89"]="Wait... why are you drawing that dagger again? Stay right there...! Don't come any closer!",
  ["100217701_9"]="When they realized the situation, the carriage was already surrounded by dark figures.",
  ["100217701_90"]="Two years might seem brief, but they were sufficient for people to change.",
  ["100217701_91"]="It was enough to shape a once-naive girl into a feral beast in the wilderness.",
  ["100217701_92"]="I can take as much as I want, right?",
  ["100217701_93"]="That's a good deal, but moving all this cargo can be a pain, so here's a simpler idea...",
  ["100217701_94"]="...I'll just take everything from you and your carriage.",
  ["100217701_95"]="Amidst the merchant's cries, faint echoes of familiar words resonated in Xin's ears.",
  ["100217701_96"]="Dad always used to say, \"Just keep going...\"",
  ["100217701_97"]="So that all the suffering I've endured will end somewhere...",
  ["100217701_98"]="Is this... where my journey ends?",
  ["100217701_99"]="*Sob*",
  ["100217801_1"]="New Dawn",
  ["100217801_10"]="Everyone else, round up all standby team members now.",
  ["100217801_11"]="Send out the evacuation route to everyone's devices. We'll start the rescue in five minutes.",
  ["100217801_12"]="Most of our people are here, but...",
  ["100217801_13"]="The member appears hesitant.",
  ["100217801_14"]="Speak up if you run into any problems.",
  ["100217801_15"]="There's a situation at the entrance.",
  ["100217801_16"]="The girl Xin saved has come back to the evacuation spot and filled in the neighbors on what happened.",
  ["100217801_17"]="The residents heard Xin was still trapped there and gathered at the entrance on their own, saying they want to help with the rescue.",
  ["100217801_18"]="...But this throws a curve ball into our rescue plan.",
  ["100217801_19"]="Are they all gathered at the entrance now?",
  ["100217801_2"]="After settling Xiaoyun, I promptly return to WeiShi and find Qing there.",
  ["100217801_20"]="...Fine, it wouldn't be appropriate to send them back now. They know the target area well, so let's get them to join the rescue team. Remember, we must ensure everyone's safety during the operation.",
  ["100217801_21"]="Got it. I'll get on it right away.",
  ["100217801_22"]="Upon completing the assignment, Qing shifts her gaze to me.",
  ["100217801_23"]="You were the last one to see Xin, and you know her location well, Head Librarian... You were part of the evacuation and are familiar with the residents.",
  ["100217801_24"]="We'll need your guidance navigating the streets.",
  ["100217801_3"]="(Recount my recent experiences.)",
  ["100217801_4"]="Qing absorbs my accounts in silence. Her brows furrow tighter, unable to hide the concern etched on her face.",
  ["100217801_5"]="Thank you for your assistance, Head Librarian.",
  ["100217801_6"]="Given the situation, now our top priority is rescuing Xin.",
  ["100217801_7"]="Following this statement, Qing adjusts her glasses and quickly resumes her usual efficiency.",
  ["100217801_8"]="Check the barricade setup in CangLin City, pinpoint the barricades in the evacuation zone, and find the shortest route.",
  ["100217801_9"]="On my way! Give me ten minutes... Actually, five will do!",
  ["100217802_1"]="At this moment, Xin is experiencing intense pain throughout her body. Even a simple action like raising her arm causes severe pain akin to being seared by flames.",
  ["100217802_10"]="She struggles to lift her head.",
  ["100217802_101"]="Tear drops streamed down her face, falling ever so gently on the paper.",
  ["100217802_102"]="Steel and bricks alone could not have built it, but also with the trust people had in each other.",
  ["100217802_103"]="It was because they had faith in the future, believed that they could overcome every hardship, and could erect a new city here...",
  ["100217802_104"]="And that's why they came here, transforming wild grassland into fertile fields and hewing the nation's granaries out of wood and stone.",
  ["100217802_105"]="I'm... sorry...",
  ["100217802_107"]="I was being too impulsive back then... I had everybody worried.",
  ["100217802_108"]="I'll try to be calm and think carefully if I am in a tough spot again. This is the last time I try to play the hero.",
  ["100217802_109"]="There is no greater virtue than recognizing one's mistake and correct them.",
  ["100217802_11"]="Before her, only an endless swarm of dark-green hue advances.",
  ["100217802_110"]="Hearing this, Qing's stern tone softened as she pushed up her glasses.",
  ["100217802_111"]="... Having said that, we can't spare the rod.",
  ["100217802_112"]="I want you to write an accident report, an essay of self-reflection, and an apology letter to other members... all to be completed after you recover.",
  ["100217802_113"]="And don't you even think about slacking off. I'll personally check everything.",
  ["100217802_114"]="Oh no! I really learned my lesson this time, Qing. Please don't make me do this!",
  ["100217802_115"]="Of course, Qing ignored Xin's whining. Once again she thanked me earnestly and left the room.",
  ["100217802_116"]="All of a sudden, the room fell silent. Realizing Zero was still waiting outside, I collected my things and was about to bid farewell to Xin.",
  ["100217802_117"]="Wait! Please don't go.",
  ["100217802_118"]="I... I have something to tell you.",
  ["100217802_119"]="Qing once told me to be grateful. You've helped me with a lot, so...",
  ["100217802_12"]="Come on! Don't tell me...",
  ["100217802_120"]="How unexpected! The usual brave and bold girl should be so nervous.",
  ["100217802_121"]="She paused and bit her lips repeatedly. Finally, as if making an extremely difficult choice, she spoke in a voice as low as a mosquito.",
  ["100217802_122"]="Thank you...",
  ["100217802_123"]="What phenomenon?",
  ["100217802_124"]="You need to speak up.",
  ["100217802_125"]="I... I...",
  ["100217802_126"]="I say, thank you for returning to save me! That's all!",
  ["100217802_127"]="When she was done speaking, Xin was as red as an overripe apple, as if she had just fought a mighty beast.",
  ["100217802_128"]="Seeing her drenched in sweat, I knew better than to tease her about it.",
  ["100217802_129"]="You are welcome.",
  ["100217802_13"]="This is all you've got, beasts!",
  ["100217802_130"]="I need something in return.",
  ["100217802_131"]="I want to know what happened in your last story.",
  ["100217802_132"]="And what happened to you and Tiaohua afterwards?",
  ["100217802_133"]="What do you think? We just went ahead along the herding trail. I've been everywhere in the Western Region. How could we get lost?",
  ["100217802_134"]="First we went to the pasture where my Dad used to herd cattle. I was surprised to see autumn pears grow again. They were kind of sour, though.",
  ["100217802_135"]="Then I took Tiaohua to the mountains where her house was. Too bad, another family was living there now...",
  ["100217802_136"]="I thought we'd keep looking with her, but she was too fragile to keep going like me. So in the end, I took her to the Bureau of Health & Welfare in the town... Those folks were better at tending to the sick.",
  ["100217802_137"]="I was going to go back to being a wanderer after that, but who could've thought... I ran into Qing there...",
  ["100217802_138"]="Qing was in Western Region?",
  ["100217802_139"]="You didn't fight her, did you?",
  ["100217802_14"]="Raising her lance, she aims toward the swarm.",
  ["100217802_140"]="Well, yeah... Qing was being... absolutely outrageous back then. She...",
  ["100217802_141"]="Xin's voice was getting lower and took on such a drawl as if she was sleep-talking, her head drooping as well.",
  ["100217802_142"]="... I got closer to her bed and saw that she had unconsciously slipped into a deep slumber.",
  ["100217802_143"]="She was even more worn out than she had thought. The Head Librarian's voice still lingered in her ears, but her eyes... simply refused to stay open.",
  ["100217802_144"]="She fell in a trance and was return to the path at sunrise.",
  ["100217802_145"]="The sun slowly revealed itself beyond the horizon. What had been a desolate land was now blanketed by a brilliant green.",
  ["100217802_146"]="Still the sky is infinite, and still the land is desolate... But now there was an unforgettable warmth.",
  ["100217802_147"]="For reasons unknown, she thought of what her father said.",
  ["100217802_148"]="As long as you walk, and keep walking, at some point, all your misery and suffering will come to an end.",
  ["100217802_149"]="Dad, I think I understand a little of what you meant all those years ago.",
  ["100217802_15"]="Like a cornered beast, she seeks to display her final defiance even amidst injuries.",
  ["100217802_150"]="However, the road I walk... will not end here.",
  ["100217802_151"]="And with that, Xin shook her head with a sense of relief and put those bygone stories behind her.",
  ["100217802_152"]="Full of hope and determination, she set out for the distant end.",
  ["100217802_16"]="Her vision blurs, ambient sounds gradually fading.",
  ["100217802_17"]="Her consciousness, stretched thin like a thread, is on the brink of snapping.",
  ["100217802_18"]="At that moment, she suddenly recalls the words she said to the Head Librarian.",
  ["100217802_19"]="I just...",
  ["100217802_2"]="Xin cannot determine if the intense pain stems from wounds inflicted by beasts or from her fractured ribs.",
  ["100217802_20"]="I just don't want to experience something like... what happened to Mom, Dad, and Tiaohua again.",
  ["100217802_21"]="Yeah, that's good enough.",
  ["100217802_22"]="Heh, CangLin City is nothing different from the wilderness...",
  ["100217802_23"]="In the end, I'm left alone again... with nobody to trust or watching my back.",
  ["100217802_24"]="Fine, I'll walk on this path alone, resolutely and unyieldingly.",
  ["100217802_25"]="Until I can no longer take further steps.",
  ["100217802_26"]="The thread of her consciousness finally snaps, the girl at her limit crumpling to the ground.",
  ["100217802_27"]="...But why?",
  ["100217802_28"]="She is not met by the chill of the road or the dry soil.",
  ["100217802_29"]="Instead, familiar figures continue to approach her...",
  ["100217802_3"]="Hah... Looks like I really messed up this time...",
  ["100217802_30"]="Three days have passed since the evacuation operation concluded.",
  ["100217802_31"]="Learning the hospital's location from a WeiShi member, I travel there to visit Xin, carrying a fruit basket.",
  ["100217802_32"]="Through the slightly open door, I catch a glimpse of the scene inside.",
  ["100217802_33"]="Qing is peeling an apple with a somber countenance, and Xin, swathed in bandages on the bed, turns away her head as if in vexation.",
  ["100217802_34"]="Merely observing from outside the room makes me sense the gloom within.",
  ["100217802_35"]="After some contemplation, I push the door open.",
  ["100217802_36"]="Excuse me...",
  ["100217802_37"]="What brings you by, Head Librarian?",
  ["100217802_38"]="Is Xin doing alright?",
  ["100217802_39"]="She's safe now, but she still needs...",
  ["100217802_4"]="Shouldn't have put my trust in others... No one's coming to help me now.",
  ["100217802_40"]="Oh, just forget about her. I'm totally fine now!",
  ["100217802_41"]="I'm up and about again! It's just those nurses won't let me leave my bed, or else I would have...",
  ["100217802_42"]="Ouch... that hurts...",
  ["100217802_43"]="Xin attempts a sweeping gesture, only to wince in pain before she lifts her arm.",
  ["100217802_44"]="Hey, now is not the time for jokes!",
  ["100217802_45"]="Do you have any idea how dangerous it was? Fractures, bruises, sprains, and dislocations... you've been literally injured all over.",
  ["100217802_46"]="If it weren't for our Head Librarian, you wouldn't just be lying in the hospital bed!",
  ["100217802_47"]="Xin appears aggrieved at Qing's scolding.",
  ["100217802_48"]="Hey, why all the scolding? These are just minor injuries! Besides, I did manage to rescue the person, didn't I?",
  ["100217802_49"]="You know, everyone else was so slow... so I thought I might as well handle it solo...",
  ["100217802_5"]="Even in the Western Region, she has never encountered such a miserable condition.",
  ["100217802_50"]="Qing sighs softly, regaining her tranquil composure.",
  ["100217802_51"]="Xin, do you remember those Cerulean Crystals that were blocking the roads?",
  ["100217802_52"]="Of course I do. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't break them. I wouldn't have taken such a risk if it weren't for those crystals.",
  ["100217802_53"]="That's right. While you couldn't handle that alone, it was thanks to \"everyone else\" that those residents helped shatter the crystals, allowing us to reach you in time.",
  ["100217802_54"]="But wait...",
  ["100217802_55"]="And you knew those infected beasts were way beyond your abilities. After you collapsed, it was the combined efforts of \"everyone else\" that helped fend them off.",
  ["100217802_56"]="If you had trusted them more and worked together, the rescue operation wouldn't have taken so long and left you seriously wounded.",
  ["100217802_57"]="That's what I've been thinking, too.",
  ["100217802_58"]="You should try to trust others a bit more.",
  ["100217802_59"]="I place the fruit basket on the bed, revealing the card nestled among the fruits.",
  ["100217802_6"]="A strange noise warrants vigilance, and the scent of beasts demands a flight for survival.",
  ["100217802_60"]="Hmm? What's this card?",
  ["100217802_61"]="Gently flipping it over, Xin is greeted with messages penned in various handwriting styles.",
  ["100217802_62"]="Hey, thank you for saving everyone, red-haired girl!&To our colleague Xin, sorry, we were a bit too slow in reinforcements.&I've stashed our family's special healing cream under the basket. Rub some on your wounds, and you'll be back on your feet in a jiffy!&Secretary Qing told us you love pears, so we've got some top-notch ones all set for you.&I've bought some milk for you to aid in your recovery.&I wish you'll get better soon, sister Xin.",
  ["100217802_63"]="Hey, thank you for saving everyone, red-haired girl!",
  ["100217802_64"]="This is the blessing that everyone wanted me to pass on to you.",
  ["100217802_65"]="They haven't forgotten about you.",
  ["100217802_66"]="I... I...",
  ["100217802_68"]="Clutching the card tightly, Xin bows her head with a tinge of guilt.",
  ["100217802_69"]="Xin, I understand that the hardships you faced in the Western Region will stay with you...",
  ["100217802_7"]="These are the most fundamental survival guidelines.",
  ["100217802_70"]="But we can't let our past pain overshadow our hope for the future.",
  ["100217802_71"]="The CangLin City beneath our feet was initially just a barren land.",
  ["100217802_72"]="A moment of silence lingers before Xin nods thoughtfully.",
  ["100217802_8"]="However, she appears to be veering in the opposite direction at present.",
  ["100217802_9"]="She cannot recall how many waves of beasts she has repelled, yet the growls are growing nearer and more frequent.",
  ["100219101_1"]="A Rare Visitor",
  ["100219101_10"]="The contact seems unyielding. Even after I bury my head under the pillow, the messages continue to inundate.",
  ["100219101_100"]="Another awkward silence falls upon us as we exchange glances, unsure how to explain things to the visitor.",
  ["100219101_102"]="Oh... I forgot to introduce them! These are my colleagues.",
  ["100219101_104"]="We... decided to clock some extra hours today! Yep, overtime it is!",
  ["100219101_106"]="You've picked a bad time, sister. Work's been piling up, even weekends are packed...",
  ["100219101_108"]="Frankly, Azi's excuse is rather terrible.",
  ["100219101_11"]="It seems I have to bid farewell to my rest.",
  ["100219101_110"]="Her sister's sudden visit catches us off guard, leaving us no time to alter the surroundings.",
  ["100219101_112"]="This pristine environment does not convey any pending tasks.",
  ["100219101_114"]="Perceiving her misstep, Azi promptly seizes the pack on her sister's back and hastily leads her away.",
  ["100219101_116"]="You've seen our company, right? We've got a lot of work to do. Should I arrange a ride back for you to rest?",
  ["100219101_118"]="I know you're swamped, Azi, but don't brush me off so quickly. In fact, I've got a special task for you this time.",
  ["100219101_12"]="As I open the message, Azi's piercing exclamations blare from the speaker.",
  ["100219101_120"]="Special... task?",
  ["100219101_122"]="Azi's sister rises and salutes us, displaying keen interest in this place.",
  ["100219101_124"]="Standing beside her sister, Azi involuntarily twitches her lips.",
  ["100219101_126"]="Thank you for looking out for my sister.",
  ["100219101_128"]="She's the youngest sister of my family, always pampered by our elders. I know she can be a handful at times.",
  ["100219101_13"]="[BBNAME]!",
  ["100219101_130"]="I hope she hasn't caused too much trouble...",
  ["100219101_132"]="Hey, I'm not that troublesome!",
  ["100219101_134"]="You're fretting too much, sister! Stop treating me like a kid.",
  ["100219101_136"]="Didn't I mention before? My business skills are top-notch.",
  ["100219101_138"]="Remember when I went to QingYu City for work? I made some connections with the Tianli folks.",
  ["100219101_14"]="Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?!",
  ["100219101_140"]="Wait, the Tianli Clan? Impressive business network you've got...",
  ["100219101_142"]="Well, business is business. I did manage to forge some strong relationships with those Tianli people, right, Qing?",
  ["100219101_144"]="True that. Tang Zi did well in that situation. She handled everything from routine patrols to liaisons exceptionally well.",
  ["100219101_146"]="Routine patrols and liaisons? Sounds like a battle...",
  ["100219101_148"]="Hey! That's... industry jargon! Yeah! It basically means managing tasks and communicating with clients.",
  ["100219101_15"]="Come help me!",
  ["100219101_150"]="You've gotta be all in, treating your job like a battlefield! That's the lesson I got from Qing!",
  ["100219101_152"]="And what really matters is that those Tianli people were really impressed by how well I did!",
  ["100219101_154"]="Not to brag, but Qing always highlights how crucial I am to the team because of my exceptional skills.",
  ["100219101_156"]="That's true. Azi has always been a vital and valued member of our team...",
  ["100219101_158"]="I see. I had no clue Azi had grown so much since coming here. Thank you so much for your mentorship.",
  ["100219101_16"]="Oh, no! This is bad! Something terrible is about to happen!",
  ["100219101_160"]="Mentorship? Well... she's very talented, and that's why we brought her on board.",
  ["100219101_162"]="Please don't be modest. I know how Azi is spoiled deep down and how clueless she was just a few years ago...",
  ["100219101_164"]="Xin and I struggle to contain our laughter on the sidelines.",
  ["100219101_166"]="They're not on the same page at all.",
  ["100219101_167"]="Leaning closer, Xin whispers in my ear.",
  ["100219101_169"]="Seems like her sister's buying into this \"media company\" tale.",
  ["100219101_17"]="Anyway, head over to WeiShi now.",
  ["100219101_171"]="If it were me, I'd be cracking up halfway and blowing the whole cover.",
  ["100219101_173"]="Just as we exchange whispers, Azhu glances over and strides towards us with a wide grin.",
  ["100219101_175"]="...I thought you were employees from a media company, so why is there a government employee here?",
  ["100219101_177"]="Xin discreetly tucks her identification card into her hem. For some reason, she happens to be carrying her card today.",
  ["100219101_179"]="Um... I'm not... you know...",
  ["100219101_18"]="I reach for my phone, only to be taken aback by a screen filled with nonsensical stickers and text.",
  ["100219101_181"]="It's all part of the act.",
  ["100219101_182"]="Exactly! It's all part of the act!",
  ["100219101_184"]="As you know, we're a major company... Lately, we're teaming up with the government for some security awareness videos.",
  ["100219101_186"]="This is our stunt double, right, Xin?",
  ["100219101_188"]="Yep, that's me, the stunt double.",
  ["100219101_19"]="If she is in the mood for sending stickers, it does not appear urgent at all. So I decide to leave her be.",
  ["100219101_190"]="Ah, got it... Any chance you've been approached about promoting Tang Sect?",
  ["100219101_192"]="Sorry, but that's classified business info...",
  ["100219101_193"]="It's all part of the act.",
  ["100219101_194"]="And you are...?",
  ["100219101_196"]="Azhu regards me with curiosity, an elusive smile lingering on her lips.",
  ["100219101_198"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_199"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_2"]="The sunlight filters through the curtain's crevices, casting a stark light on my face.",
  ["100219101_20"]="Hey! Don't ignore me!",
  ["100219101_200"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_201"]="...",
  ["100219101_205"]="Pfft...!",
  ["100219101_209"]="Hey, don't just make stuff up!",
  ["100219101_21"]="You saw the message I sent, didn't you?",
  ["100219101_213"]="This is actually my colleague. We've been a team for ages.",
  ["100219101_217"]="Usually, this place is bustling... but since it's the weekend, it's quiet. You must be tired from the journey. Let's head back and relax, shall we?",
  ["100219101_22"]="If you keep ignoring me, I'll plant landmines all around your room!",
  ["100219101_221"]="Sounds good to me.",
  ["100219101_225"]="I just wanted to drop by and make sure you're doing all right here.",
  ["100219101_229"]="Now since everything seems to be running smoothly, I'll head back and catch up with our grandparents.",
  ["100219101_23"]="In the end, for my own safety, I decide to head to WeiShi.",
  ["100219101_230"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_231"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_232"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_233"]="Yeah, everything's been great! There's a fantastic hotpot spot on the pedestrian street I bet you'll love!",
  ["100219101_234"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_235"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_236"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_237"]="But I do have a small favor to ask...",
  ["100219101_238"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_239"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_24"]="It is the weekend now, and only a few members remain on duty there.",
  ["100219101_240"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_241"]="Huh?",
  ["100219101_242"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_243"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_244"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_245"]="Now that you're a key player at the media company, how about coming up with a campaign to promote Tang Sect?",
  ["100219101_246"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_247"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_248"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_249"]="This... Well, that won't be too hard... I guess...",
  ["100219101_25"]="Their relaxed expressions suggest no emergencies. The presumed \"something terrible\" likely stems from trouble caused by Azi herself.",
  ["100219101_250"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_251"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_252"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_253"]="Hah! No problem at all!",
  ["100219101_254"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_255"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_256"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_257"]="My boss can handle campaigns like a pro. This will be a breeze for her!",
  ["100219101_258"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_259"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_26"]="As anticipated, upon entering the hall, I observe Qing and Xin wearing resigned expressions, while Azi pleads for assistance nearby.",
  ["100219101_260"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_261"]="At Xin's remarks, Azi's face nearly turns purple as she clenches her teeth, visibly struggling to reply.",
  ["100219101_262"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_263"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_264"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_265"]="Haha... Yeah, it's just a walk in the park...",
  ["100219101_266"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_267"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_268"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_269"]="Let's make a deal then. You've got a week to show me your growth.",
  ["100219101_27"]="Good morning, Head Librarian.",
  ["100219101_270"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_271"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_272"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_273"]="Azi's sister embraces her, oblivious to her distressed expression and Xin's grimace behind her.",
  ["100219101_274"]="I'm Azi's most reliable colleague.",
  ["100219101_275"]="I'm Azi's assistant.",
  ["100219101_276"]="I'm Azi's direct supervisor.",
  ["100219101_28"]="Sorry to bother you on your day off, but Azi insisted we needed you here...",
  ["100219101_29"]="Yeah, she's asking us to play house with her.",
  ["100219101_3"]="A Rare Visitor",
  ["100219101_30"]="Hey, it's not playing house! It's a serious situation!",
  ["100219101_31"]="If you don't act now, you might never see your lovely Azi again!",
  ["100219101_32"]="What do you mean?",
  ["100219101_33"]="Can you explain it more clearly?",
  ["100219101_34"]="So, she wants us to go along with her.",
  ["100219101_35"]="Xin, quiet! This is a crisis in my life!",
  ["100219101_36"]="Listen up, [BBNAME]. Just yesterday, my sister messaged me saying she's coming to check on me for our grandparents. She might be here soon.",
  ["100219101_37"]="(Applaud for her.)",
  ["100219101_38"]="Family reunions are always nice.",
  ["100219101_39"]="So, are you treating us to dinner?",
  ["100219101_4"]="This leisurely day feels somewhat self-indulgent, given the responsibilities I have been undertaking.",
  ["100219101_40"]="That's not the point!",
  ["100219101_41"]="I left my hometown without saying goodbye to them. And then, to ease their minds, I lied and said I was working at a big media company... Last month, I even spun a tale about being in line for a promotion to department head.",
  ["100219101_42"]="But you know my actual job here. I can't let my sister find out I work part-time at a milk tea shop and hot pot restaurant.",
  ["100219101_43"]="Otherwise... WeiShi will lose a crucial member like me!",
  ["100219101_44"]="But it's just a part-time job. Why hide it?",
  ["100219101_45"]="Personally, I think you should take this chance to explain everything.",
  ["100219101_46"]="No way! If my family knew the truth, they'd drag me back home in a flash!",
  ["100219101_47"]="That sounds scary.",
  ["100219101_48"]="That's the Tang Sect for you, famous for their hidden weapons and poisons...",
  ["100219101_49"]="If you cross them, you might end up with a mysterious death one day.",
  ["100219101_5"]="Nevertheless, today marks a long-awaited day of rest, devoid of any tasks.",
  ["100219101_50"]="Xin sticks out his tongue and makes an exaggerated grimace.",
  ["100219101_51"]="Hey, Tang Sect isn't some shady criminal organization, alright?!",
  ["100219101_52"]="From what I know, Tang Sect has been a respected sect in the Western Region for over a century.",
  ["100219101_53"]="Rumor has it they excel in all kinds of arts, knowledge, and technology.",
  ["100219101_54"]="Well... it's not really as miraculous as people say...",
  ["100219101_55"]="Maybe outsiders have blown it out of proportion, and our elders haven't bothered to correct them... So Tang Sect's reputation became exaggerated.",
  ["100219101_56"]="In that case, it's best to steer clear of this.",
  ["100219101_57"]="Family matters are private, especially with the complex history of Tang Sect.",
  ["100219101_58"]="Please give my regards to your father, Azi.",
  ["100219101_59"]="Hey, don't give up on me just yet!",
  ["100219101_6"]="Therefore, I will make the most of this well-deserved day off.",
  ["100219101_60"]="We're knee-deep in this mess together!",
  ["100219101_61"]="In the letter, I may have exaggerated a bit, saying that you were really into Tang Sect techniques, so I brought you in as outer-ring disciples... or something along those lines...",
  ["100219101_62"]="Huh? Outer-ring disciples? Seriously?",
  ["100219101_63"]="So now you're sort of connected to Tang Sect...",
  ["100219101_64"]="And?",
  ["100219101_65"]="I also mentioned that I've taught you everything I know.",
  ["100219101_66"]="Imagine this, if they drag me back, what will happen to you as my disciples?",
  ["100219101_67"]="Do you think those stubborn elders will just let our disciples hang around here without a mentor?",
  ["100219101_68"]="...",
  ["100219101_69"]="Qing removes her glasses and takes a piece of cloth, cleaning them back and forth.",
  ["100219101_7"]="Perhaps it would be prudent to silence all thoughts and spend the day sleeping to dispel the fatigue from recent events.",
  ["100219101_70"]="I'm starting to think I should call the Bureau of Civil Security to arrest you now.",
  ["100219101_71"]="I've been working with the Bureau of Civil Security to combat scam these days, never thought we had a scammer right here among us...",
  ["100219101_72"]="So, could you just go along with my story, please?... Secretary Qing? Sister Qing? My greatest boss ever...?",
  ["100219101_73"]="Hang on. Being your sister sounds like a whole lot of trouble.",
  ["100219101_74"]="I'm not sure what you mean by \"go along,\" but I won't lie for you.",
  ["100219101_75"]="No worries! I'm not asking you to lie! Just tell the truth, but don't spill anything unnecessary until I give you the cue, okay?",
  ["100219101_76"]="Well, that's acceptable... I suppose.",
  ["100219101_77"]="Qing lets out a long sigh.",
  ["100219101_78"]="Well, I have a ton of business to handle. I'll give your sister a quick rundown of your usual work and life, and nothing more.",
  ["100219101_79"]="Convincing your sister, though, is on you to figure out.",
  ["100219101_8"]="Yes, this is my well-deserved right...",
  ["100219101_80"]="Thanks a bunch, Qing! You're a lifesaver!",
  ["100219101_81"]="And you, [BBNAME]. You're the reliable colleague here with that solid vibe.",
  ["100219101_82"]="And you, Xin. You play the role of my assistant, pretty please.",
  ["100219101_83"]="Huh? Why do I have to be your assistant, being bossed around?",
  ["100219101_84"]="And hey... do you really think the Head Librarian seems more dependable than me?",
  ["100219101_85"]="Let's not dwell on that for now. With these twists, we'll have to wing it. Thanks a million for all the help! I owe you big time this round!",
  ["100219101_86"]="At that moment, a figure clad in red halts at the entrance of WeiShi.",
  ["100219101_87"]="Hmm? Is this Azi's workplace, WeiShi Culture and Media Company?",
  ["100219101_88"]="This is supposed to be one of the largest companies in CangLin City, but where's the receptionist at least?",
  ["100219101_89"]="Here you go, sister Azhu! Have some tea!",
  ["100219101_9"]="I repeatedly reassure myself amidst the almost intrusive high-frequency buzz in my ears.",
  ["100219101_90"]="Ah, thank you.",
  ["100219101_91"]="The woman in red accepts the cup from Azi, offering us a smile without a word.",
  ["100219101_92"]="...",
  ["100219101_93"]="Are we supposed to chime in now?",
  ["100219101_94"]="Not my call. I don't feel like stepping up and helping her with her fib.",
  ["100219101_96"]="It's kinda fun to watch how this plays out, don't you think?",
  ["100219101_98"]="I'm curious to see how she will handle this.",
  ["100219201_1"]="Flying Darts",
  ["100219201_10"]="Replicas of the authentic flying darts, crafted by Tang Sect disciples...",
  ["100219201_11"]="Catching sight of me, Azi waves with a touch of embarrassment.",
  ["100219201_12"]="Help me out here!",
  ["100219201_13"]="Azhu's still around, so could you do me one more favor, please?",
  ["100219201_14"]="What are you doing here?",
  ["100219201_15"]="Is this some new type of scam?",
  ["100219201_16"]="(Act like you did not see them.)",
  ["100219201_17"]="Anyway, please help me distribute these flyers! Pretty please!",
  ["100219201_18"]="Azi thrusts a thick stack of flyers into my hands, containing details about the Flying Darts. The densely printed information could overwhelm any casual observer.",
  ["100219201_19"]="I initially thought it was a spur-of-the-moment idea, but turns out she had everything planned out! She even managed to get a temporary permit for hosting outdoor events from the Bureau of Culture & Tourism.",
  ["100219201_2"]="Following the Cerulean Blight crisis, this is the first time I experience the daily life in Qian.",
  ["100219201_20"]="What's even more peculiar is that this was supposed to be a family visit, but she brought along a bunch of flyers and these models of Flying Darts!",
  ["100219201_21"]="Honestly, I'm worried that most people will just think Tang Sect is a fictional group from some Wuxia fantasy.",
  ["100219201_22"]="So, can you fill me in on what's happening here?",
  ["100219201_23"]="After we split up that day, we made this crazy bet to reach over 100,000 followers on our new account promoting Tang Sect within a week.",
  ["100219201_24"]="One hundred thousand followers! All in just a week!",
  ["100219201_25"]="It shouldn't be too challenging for you, right?",
  ["100219201_26"]="But aren't you already an influencer...?",
  ["100219201_27"]="Don't you have over a million followers?",
  ["100219201_28"]="You... do you really have to rub it in?",
  ["100219201_29"]="Honestly, I manage dozens of accounts across those platforms, and only one of them has around 10,000 followers... If you add them all up, it might reach a million followers.",
  ["100219201_3"]="Flying Darts",
  ["100219201_30"]="That includes accounts that got banned because I bought followers...",
  ["100219201_31"]="As for the other accounts, they're either inactive or banned...",
  ["100219201_32"]="How many sock puppets do you have?",
  ["100219201_33"]="Your accounts got banned?",
  ["100219201_34"]="Managing we-media is tough... especially when you're doing it solo. You always need to bring something fresh to the table, and if you get banned, it's back to square one. I... I've lost quite a bit of money because of this...",
  ["100219201_35"]="Anyway, building a fanbase slowly won't work now. I have to make this happen in a week, or I'll be taken back to the Western Region.",
  ["100219201_36"]="Oh, so you're heading back to the Western Region?",
  ["100219201_37"]="Hmm... how about we have a farewell dinner sometime?",
  ["100219201_38"]="Azi noticeably bristles upon hearing Xin's words.",
  ["100219201_39"]="Hey! Shouldn't you be trying to convince me to stay now?",
  ["100219201_4"]="The bustling morning market immerses everyone in a lively atmosphere of trade and commerce, a vivid sight that captivates all onlookers.",
  ["100219201_40"]="And look at how things turned out... You're partly to blame for this, Xin!",
  ["100219201_41"]="Huh? How is this my fault?",
  ["100219201_42"]="When Azhu pitched her idea, you were encouraging her, right?",
  ["100219201_43"]="Perhaps... I guess.",
  ["100219201_44"]="And Qing, too.",
  ["100219201_45"]="She described me as \"talented\" and a \"vital and valued member\"... Looks like I'll have to give it all now.",
  ["100219201_46"]="And you know, my sister is acting strangely this time. She used to see through all my stories, but after just two years, she's actually buying into them.",
  ["100219201_47"]="People often jump to odd conclusions about things they don't understand.",
  ["100219201_48"]="Oh, by the way, the performance was a huge hit. I overheard people talking about it on my way here.",
  ["100219201_49"]="Ohhhh! Really?",
  ["100219201_5"]="I would love to spend the entire morning in a teahouse, savoring some delicious tea and soaking in the ambiance.",
  ["100219201_50"]="But why all the excitement? Most people seemed skeptical.",
  ["100219201_51"]="How should I put it... it feels like they're expecting someone to make a fool of themselves, you know?",
  ["100219201_52"]="Alright, I'm off to hand out flyers and do some eavesdropping.",
  ["100219201_6"]="However, fate has other plans today. Morning greeted me with another round of urgent messages from Azi.",
  ["100219201_7"]="Evidently, this is related to her unresolved promise with her sister...",
  ["100219201_8"]="Upon arriving at the location, I am surprised to find Azi's sister Azhu distributing flyers.",
  ["100219201_9"]="Tang Sect Flying Darts! Anyone interested?",
  ["100219301_1"]="Swallow Step",
  ["100219301_10"]="So, it was you. That explains it.",
  ["100219301_11"]="Thanks for the kind words. The prizes caught my eye, so I decided to give it a shot on the spot.",
  ["100219301_12"]="I didn't expect to win so many gifts.",
  ["100219301_13"]="I'd love to chat with that disciple, but I have to tend to Mr. Nong's fields. I'll head off for now.",
  ["100219301_14"]="Watching Wushi depart, I realize that convincing him to give up the gift would be too awkward.",
  ["100219301_15"]="The Flying Darts gleam as its arrowhead strikes precisely at the mark, emitting a sharp whistle as if poised to penetrate the target.",
  ["100219301_16"]="Azi remains composed, maintaining her posture following the release of the Flying Darts.",
  ["100219301_17"]="That was... impressive!",
  ["100219301_18"]="Raising her head, Azi glances at the Flying Darts embedded in the mark and straightens her body.",
  ["100219301_19"]="Hah, it's no big deal. I'm a Tang Sect disciple, so this kind of thing is a piece of cake.",
  ["100219301_2"]="Where has that person gone?",
  ["100219301_20"]="...If that person hadn't tried to steal the spotlight, today would have been my moment to shine.",
  ["100219301_21"]="Who was that person anyway?",
  ["100219301_22"]="Sorry, I lost track of him.",
  ["100219301_23"]="Just some random guy passing by.",
  ["100219301_24"]="Wait, does that mean the gifts I prepared...",
  ["100219301_25"]="I avert my gaze, nodding with feigned seriousness.",
  ["100219301_26"]="...",
  ["100219301_27"]="CangLin City really has some unexpected talents. Can you believe such a skilled person is just farming the fields...?",
  ["100219301_28"]="Or maybe this is part of their training too...",
  ["100219301_29"]="The atmosphere grows increasingly enthusiastic, yet Azi remains aside.",
  ["100219301_3"]="Swallow Step",
  ["100219301_30"]="Quietly approaching her from behind, I find her simply reclining on the railing, gazing into the distance.",
  ["100219301_31"]="What are you doing here?",
  ["100219301_32"]="You were really impressive back there.",
  ["100219301_33"]="Hmm... What? Oh, it's you... You startled me.",
  ["100219301_34"]="Don't sneak up on me like that. I'm still recovering from all the tension.",
  ["100219301_35"]="Because you were scared of losing?",
  ["100219301_36"]="Because you were worried that your sister might figure out?",
  ["100219301_37"]="Who would've thought that a random passerby almost ruined Tang Sect's reputation?",
  ["100219301_38"]="When I released that last flying cluster, I couldn't even bear to look up. If I missed, how could I face anyone in this city?",
  ["100219301_39"]="I thought you struck that pose on purpose.",
  ["100219301_4"]="I navigate through the crowd in search of the mysterious person.",
  ["100219301_40"]="Yeah, I did it on purpose. It was a way to hide my embarrassment if I missed.",
  ["100219301_41"]="Those prizes... Looks like I'll be juggling multiple part-time jobs again soon.",
  ["100219301_42"]="Shush, keep it down.",
  ["100219301_43"]="Your sister is still around here.",
  ["100219301_44"]="Multiple part-time jobs?",
  ["100219301_45"]="Oh, I... I meant juggling multiple roles! But let's not dive into my tight schedule... what do you think of today's campaign?",
  ["100219301_46"]="I'm impressed.",
  ["100219301_47"]="Yeah... I'm glad it lived up to your expectations.",
  ["100219301_48"]="Azhu promptly interrupts Azi's words.",
  ["100219301_49"]="I'm really impressed by how quickly your skills have improved.",
  ["100219301_5"]="It's been a while, [BBNAME].",
  ["100219301_50"]="What about the Swallow Step campaign? Have you figured it out yet?",
  ["100219301_51"]="Yeah, I do have some ideas...",
  ["100219301_52"]="But they might be different from what you're thinking.",
  ["100219301_53"]="The Swallow Step was originally used by ancient Tang Sect assassins for stealthy urban movement.",
  ["100219301_54"]="A skilled Swallow Step practitioner moves as swiftly as a swallow, effortlessly traversing buildings as if on the ground. They can glide through crowds like a breeze.",
  ["100219301_55"]="If we were in a different city with ancient walls or structures, I could showcase my skills better.",
  ["100219301_56"]="But CangLin City is modern, with new buildings.",
  ["100219301_57"]="That's why it's impossible to showcase the Swallow Step in a modern city like this!",
  ["100219301_58"]="So, let's take a fresh approach. Let's convince people that the Swallow Step is just practical and useful footwork.",
  ["100219301_59"]="So, more prizes?",
  ["100219301_6"]="Wushi?",
  ["100219301_60"]="Hey, I'm not swimming in money!",
  ["100219301_61"]="I mean, we can help others instead... Check this out!",
  ["100219301_62"]="Lost and found?",
  ["100219301_63"]="Yeah, exactly! Lost and found!",
  ["100219301_64"]="Everyone's had something stuck between buildings or in a tree, right?",
  ["100219301_65"]="Like a balloon caught in a tree or clothes snagged on a rooftop...",
  ["100219301_66"]="Wouldn't it be perfect to showcase the Swallow Step in these situations?",
  ["100219301_67"]="Well... might be worth a try.",
  ["100219301_68"]="It's always good to lend a hand, no matter the outcome.",
  ["100219301_69"]="I posted the event on the city forum earlier. I bet we have a bunch of requests by now.",
  ["100219301_7"]="Turning around, I notice Wushi's puzzled gaze as he holds a sizable pile of gifts.",
  ["100219301_70"]="Let me take care of this.",
  ["100219301_71"]="As Azi sets aside her cellphone, her brows gradually furrow.",
  ["100219301_72"]="...",
  ["100219301_73"]="What are all these requests about?!",
  ["100219301_74"]="Look at them! Some people are just being lazy, huh?",
  ["100219301_75"]="But once a post is out there, there's no turning back.",
  ["100219301_76"]="Tsk... looks like we'll have to tackle these now.",
  ["100219301_77"]="Let's see, someone posted a request two minutes ago... To retrieve a kite stuck on the eaves.",
  ["100219301_78"]="We should get more details first.",
  ["100219301_8"]="Didn't expect to run into you here.",
  ["100219301_9"]="Your skills were impressive...",
  ["100219401_1"]="Condensed Poison",
  ["100219401_10"]="So, we've tackled the Flying Darts and Swallow Step parts, and now it's time for Condensed Poison.",
  ["100219401_11"]="But displaying that feels... really inappropriate, don't you think?",
  ["100219401_12"]="What do you mean by con... commence prison? It's about poisoning people, right?",
  ["100219401_13"]="Are you trying to showcase the power of Tang Sect poison to the public?",
  ["100219401_14"]="You're not seriously considering adding strange stuff to the water supply, are you?",
  ["100219401_15"]="No way! That's way too extreme for me!",
  ["100219401_16"]="Besides, the whole Condensed Poison thing has a pretty shady history to begin with.",
  ["100219401_17"]="Azi rests her head on a pack, appearing lost in thought.",
  ["100219401_18"]="Like you said, Condensed Poison is all about poisoning people. Because of it, many mistake our sect for a group of villains, and whenever people mention us, it's all about shady figures slipping things into drinks.",
  ["100219401_19"]="Seriously, we should just kick that Condensed Poison out of the Four Arts of Tang Sect.",
  ["100219401_2"]="Several days later, at the milk tea shop on CangLin City's commercial street.",
  ["100219401_20"]="...I'm sorry if this causes any misunderstandings.",
  ["100219401_21"]="Actually, the poison skills in the ancient scrolls have rarely been used since there weren't many dire situations that required extreme measures. Nowadays, not many disciples specialize in that art.",
  ["100219401_22"]="Could it end up being lost to time?",
  ["100219401_23"]="Historically, Tang Sect disciples skilled in \"Condensed Poison\" often posed as pharmacists.",
  ["100219401_24"]="As the saying goes, \"All medicine carries poison.\" Many of the poisons we use are extracted from medicinal herbs.",
  ["100219401_25"]="Despite the ups and downs of history, pharmacists are always in demand, so the art of Condensed Poison has survived to this day.",
  ["100219401_26"]="Pharmacists... pharmacists... Oh! I've got an idea!",
  ["100219401_27"]="Huh?",
  ["100219401_28"]="What's on your mind?",
  ["100219401_29"]="Are you considering making herbal medicines?",
  ["100219401_3"]="Condensed Poison",
  ["100219401_30"]="But wouldn't it poison people?",
  ["100219401_31"]="Absolutely not! I don't even have a pharmacist's license!",
  ["100219401_32"]="Plus, who would want to drink herbal concoctions?",
  ["100219401_33"]="We can whip up something people will enjoy, something that soothes the soul...",
  ["100219401_34"]="Yeah, I'm talking about milk tea.",
  ["100219401_35"]="How does that relate to Tang Sect?",
  ["100219401_36"]="Hmhm... the essence of milk tea lies in extracting flavors from tea leaves.",
  ["100219401_37"]="Similarly, Condensed Poison focuses on extracting essence from herbs.",
  ["100219401_38"]="Applying the art of Condensed Poison to making milk tea could result in an exceptional brew!",
  ["100219401_39"]="I'm planning a milk tea contest to showcase Condensed Poison in a whole new way!",
  ["100219401_4"]="I gaze at the milk teas with tension.",
  ["100219401_5"]="Several cups of milk tea emitting unusual scents are arranged in a row.",
  ["100219401_6"]="Describing them as milk tea seems a stretch, as person in their right mind would consuming such ominous drinks.",
  ["100219401_7"]="However, with all eyes fixed on me, I have no choice but to drink them all.",
  ["100219401_8"]="Drawing a deep breath, I muster the courage to reach for one of the cups filled with an unknown liquid.",
  ["100219401_9"]="A few days back, at WeiShi.",
  ["100219501_1"]="Integration into Society",
  ["100219501_10"]="Well, you did get people talking about Tang Sect, so there's that.",
  ["100219501_11"]="I knew this wouldn't end well.",
  ["100219501_12"]="Now my sect's reputation must be in tatters, right? Ugh, I'm struggling right now...",
  ["100219501_13"]="Well, I'm probably the one struggling the most...",
  ["100219501_14"]="I mean it, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you later.",
  ["100219501_15"]="But for now, we have more urgent matters to attend to.",
  ["100219501_16"]="You're talking about the final aspect of the Four Arts of Tang Sect, right?",
  ["100219501_17"]="Yeah, if I remember correctly, it's called \"Ingenium.\"",
  ["100219501_18"]="But this should be the easiest, right? Just present those gadgets to people, and we're done, right? Once they see your display of Tang Sect ingenium, they'll be eager to learn more.",
  ["100219501_19"]="Absent-minded, Azi fiddles with the Luban Lock in her hand before casually tossing it to me.",
  ["100219501_2"]="I'm so, so, so sorry!",
  ["100219501_20"]="Here, take a look at this.",
  ["100219501_21"]="This is pretty much the only thing I have right now that could pass as \"ingenium\"...",
  ["100219501_22"]="Huh? Wait, I thought Tang Sect ingenium was supposed to be like a super powerful mecha that transforms and tackles all sorts of situations?",
  ["100219501_23"]="Actually, it's more like a handy knife that tackles all sorts of situations.",
  ["100219501_24"]="At the end of the day, ingenium is just a bunch of gadgets working together.",
  ["100219501_25"]="As times change, some evolve into everyday tools while others get replaced by more advanced tech.",
  ["100219501_26"]="Even though we have some eye-catching contraptions, most of them are stored away within my sect. You won't easily find them in this city.",
  ["100219501_27"]="If I had known how tricky this Ingenium part would be, I might have skipped the first three aspects.",
  ["100219501_28"]="Or maybe I should have just relaxed and enjoyed myself. Anyway, Azhu is taking me back to the Western Region soon.",
  ["100219501_29"]="Will your sister really take you back to the Western Region?",
  ["100219501_3"]="Integration into Society",
  ["100219501_30"]="It seems like you're the one psyching yourself out here.",
  ["100219501_31"]="Will your sister really take you back to the Western Region?",
  ["100219501_32"]="It seems like you're the one psyching yourself out here.",
  ["100219501_33"]="Anyone would be upset if they found out they'd been deceived from the start.",
  ["100219501_34"]="It's all my fault. I shouldn't have started this mess by putting on this whole \"urban elitist\" charade in the first place...",
  ["100219501_35"]="It's never too late to apologize.",
  ["100219501_36"]="Just saying sorry when things hit rock bottom seems insincere.",
  ["100219501_37"]="Your attitude is crucial in all of this.",
  ["100219501_38"]="Apologizing alone won't cut it.",
  ["100219501_39"]="Everyone is interested in Tang Sect ingenium.",
  ["100219501_4"]="Azi folds her arms, burying her head in the crook of her arm.",
  ["100219501_40"]="Maybe your sister could lend a hand.",
  ["100219501_41"]="Yeah... I can't afford to bring shame to my sect.",
  ["100219501_42"]="She grits her teeth, which only accentuates her hesitation. With a \"bang,\" the door is slammed shut.",
  ["100219501_43"]="I can barely discern if she leaves to apologize or to pick a fight.",
  ["100219501_44"]="...So that's the truth of it. Please forgive me, sister...",
  ["100219501_45"]="Azhu, seated on the chair, enjoys the snacks provided by Azi while checking the calendar.",
  ["100219501_46"]="Honestly, you held up longer than I thought, and those first three campaigns were pretty impressive. Oh... mind giving me a back rub?",
  ["100219501_47"]="Sure... wait, \"held up longer than you thought\"? You knew we were putting on an act from the beginning?",
  ["100219501_48"]="Of course, it was pretty obvious, right?",
  ["100219501_49"]="Azhu hands us snacks.",
  ["100219501_5"]="I just thought adding those herbs would introduce unique flavors.",
  ["100219501_50"]="Let's enjoy these snacks together. To be honest, your acting skills could use some work.",
  ["100219501_51"]="Wait... you knew I was struggling and didn't say anything?",
  ["100219501_52"]="Well, I wasn't just watching you struggle. Asking you to promote Tang Sect was a bit much, but it was part of my plan. Actually... the elders have been eager to meet you for a while now, and they wanted me to pass on a message...",
  ["100219501_53"]="A message? For me?",
  ["100219501_54"]="Azhu lets out a sigh.",
  ["100219501_55"]="Thanks to your fake reports, Dad has been singing your praises to everyone... and now, things about you have been exaggerated to the point that people think organizing a promotion campaign for Tang Sect is a walk in the park for you.",
  ["100219501_56"]="Hold on... I have a question.",
  ["100219501_57"]="Isn't it usually other trades using your reputation to attract attention. Why would Tang Sect even need promotion?",
  ["100219501_58"]="You know how Tang Sect is portrayed in those animations, right? Just the name alone can scare a lot of folks, like \"In the shadows he lurks. From the shadows he strikes.\"",
  ["100219501_59"]="Well... we did gain fame during turbulent times, but it was mostly about survival. Now that things are more peaceful, even us, the masters of assassination, need to find new ways to fit in.",
  ["100219501_6"]="And even if there are minor side effects, it should be fine.",
  ["100219501_60"]="Oh, I get what you mean... I prefer the mysterious Tang Sect from Wuxia stories actually.",
  ["100219501_61"]="Fame alone won't pay the bills.",
  ["100219501_62"]="Practical matters matter in life.",
  ["100219501_63"]="Absolutely.",
  ["100219501_64"]="The traditional arts of Tang Sect aren't as necessary in today's world, and many ancient techniques have faded from public view, existing mostly in people's imaginations. But let's face it, we're not immortal, and we need to make a living.",
  ["100219501_65"]="So, is this your main target for this trip, sister?",
  ["100219501_66"]="Well, not exactly... My main target was to see you. It's been ages since we last met.",
  ["100219501_67"]="Azi grimaces, leaving uncertainty about whether she is on the verge of tears or laughter. Eventually, she reclines on the bed, appearing relieved.",
  ["100219501_68"]="So, all the effort and funds I put into those campaigns... and the struggles...",
  ["100219501_69"]="What else did you expect me to do?",
  ["100219501_7"]="Should we see this as a blessing in disguise? The citizens seem quite positive about your oolong tea or whatever...",
  ["100219501_70"]="She thought you were coming to take her away.",
  ["100219501_71"]="Good thing you cleared up that misunderstanding.",
  ["100219501_72"]="Good thing you cleared up that misunderstanding.",
  ["100219501_73"]="If you'd been more direct... I wouldn't be in this mess.",
  ["100219501_74"]="Well, let's wrap up what we started. We've just got one more task to go.",
  ["100219501_75"]="You did a lot of preparation before coming, so you must have brought some cool gadgets with you, right?",
  ["100219501_76"]="No, I didn't... I figured I could always swing by QingYu City if I needed any contraptions since it's not too far from here.",
  ["100219501_77"]="QingYu City? Why are you going there?",
  ["100219501_78"]="Remember those intricate contraptions we saw on Mount Tianque? They are the oldest large-scale machines in Qian.",
  ["100219501_79"]="As the birthplace of the concept of \"ingenium,\" it should have a collection of well-preserved parts for exhibition.",
  ["100219501_8"]="Really?",
  ["100219501_80"]="Gosh... that sounds risky. Let's hope we don't fall into any traps involving mercury or quicksand.",
  ["100219501_81"]="Hey, no worries!",
  ["100219501_82"]="We'll just look for some small transforming toys.",
  ["100219501_83"]="Plus, even if we stumble upon deadly weapons, we can escape, because our predecessors never wanted to brutally take lives.",
  ["100219501_9"]="Yeah, their comments were like, \"I can't believe they took down that guy so easily.\" \"Yeah, Tang Sect is truly formidable.\"",
  ["100219601_1"]="Several days later, in CangLin City.",
  ["100219601_10"]="No, something's definitely amiss. Let me check this out...",
  ["100219601_11"]="...Hold on, what's going on there?!",
  ["100219601_12"]="As I take Azi's cellphone, the first thing I see are photos depicting us battling frenzied beasts on Mount Tianque, accompanied by narratives.",
  ["100219601_13"]="\"At that pivotal moment, with a chilling flash, the two disciples of the Tang Sect unleashed a storm of arrow bolts at the ape...\"",
  ["100219601_14"]="\"In a panic, the remaining beasts sought to flee into the valley, only to find it veiled in a toxic fog crafted by the Tang Sect. Despite their tough hides, they found themselves ensnared by the lethal clutches of the poison...\"",
  ["100219601_15"]="Quite the dramatic narration.",
  ["100219601_16"]="Any close-up shots of my heroic pose?",
  ["100219601_17"]="Hey, that's not the point!",
  ["100219601_18"]="Oh boy, I'm afraid those visitors will be disappointed.",
  ["100219601_19"]="Everyone, today we're displaying some simple and user-friendly machines we use in Tang Sect.",
  ["100219601_2"]="Hey! Over here!",
  ["100219601_20"]="Take this hand-cranked wooden fan, for example. It's a clever invention from centuries ago to beat the heat before we had electricity.",
  ["100219601_21"]="And look at this kite. It flaps its wings in the wind...",
  ["100219601_22"]="Oh, and this little waterwheel...",
  ["100219601_23"]="Hang on... Aren't you going to show us some real ingenia? I mean, the real stuff?",
  ["100219601_24"]="The real stuff?... I'm sorry, but I'm not following.",
  ["100219601_25"]="Aren't these the ingenia from Tang Sect you're looking for?",
  ["100219601_26"]="No, no, no. We want to see the fancy contraptions you used to fend off those wild beasts! Like repeating crossbows or hidden swords that can transform into a hundred different forms!",
  ["100219601_27"]="Well... our preparation for today was a bit rushed, and I didn't bring any weapons...",
  ["100219601_28"]="Plus, our main aim is to give people a better understanding of Tang Sect. We're not all about weaponry...",
  ["100219601_29"]="You've got quite a stereotypical view of Tang Sect...",
  ["100219601_3"]="Azi waves at me from a distance.",
  ["100219601_30"]="Azhu's voice gradually trails off.",
  ["100219601_31"]="...",
  ["100219601_32"]="...",
  ["100219601_33"]="Ahh, I see what you mean now!",
  ["100219601_34"]="Your weaponry skills are top-secret in your sect, right? Not something to share with outsiders, got it!",
  ["100219601_35"]="Huh?",
  ["100219601_36"]="Losing ingenia accidentally would be a disaster, huh? Best to keep those dangerous things under wraps.",
  ["100219601_37"]="T-that's not what I meant! Really... it's not something that fancy!",
  ["100219601_38"]="Tang Sect ingenia are just handy gadgets, nothing more.",
  ["100219601_39"]="See? I knew it... People often jump to odd conclusions about things they don't understand.",
  ["100219601_4"]="You seem pretty relaxed today.",
  ["100219601_40"]="Help me explain this to our guests, Azi!",
  ["100219601_41"]="Otherwise, all our hard work will be wasted!",
  ["100219601_42"]="Huh? It's on me again?",
  ["100219601_43"]="Alright, let's get this sorted...",
  ["100219601_44"]="If you want to dive deeper into Tang Sect details, follow my account \"Azi Official,\" and I'll break things down as a Tang Sect disciple! Thank you!",
  ["100219601_5"]="Yeah, not much action going on right now.",
  ["100219601_6"]="Sister's got the final demonstration part covered.",
  ["100219601_7"]="By the way...",
  ["100219601_8"]="Don't you think there are too many people around here?",
  ["100219601_9"]="Now that you mention it, something does fell off... It's way too lively for a small-sized science exhibit.",
  ["100220101_1"]="Reserved",
  ["100220101_10"]="The massive silhouette sweeps over her head, soaring into the distance.",
  ["100220101_11"]="Holding her breath, she stands still, watching the bird as it vanishes into the horizon.",
  ["100220101_12"]="Did any of you... see that?",
  ["100220101_13"]="Wait, you didn't see anything? Or hear anything?",
  ["100220101_14"]="Nothing at all!",
  ["100220101_15"]="You really shouldn't keep staring at the sky like that, Ming. It's not good for your eyes.",
  ["100220101_16"]="Faced with everyone's nonchalance, Ming almost begins to doubt herself.",
  ["100220101_17"]="But I really saw it...",
  ["100220101_18"]="You're not just messing with us, right? If you keep this up, I'm not going to play with you anymore!",
  ["100220101_19"]="Starting to see things like this old man, huh?",
  ["100220101_2"]="A Fleeting Glimpse",
  ["100220101_20"]="As her explanations fall on deaf ears, Ming turns around, walking towards the courtyard entrance.",
  ["100220101_21"]="Hey, where are you going?",
  ["100220101_22"]="It's getting dark, Ming. Don't wander off.",
  ["100220101_23"]="Ming pauses at the threshold, gazing at the people inside, a hint of naive stubbornness on her face.",
  ["100220101_24"]="I'm not lying.",
  ["100220101_25"]="I'll go find it.",
  ["100220101_3"]="At first, it is a loud, echoing bird chirp breaking the silence from the distant horizon.",
  ["100220101_4"]="Ming looks upward in response, only to find nothing in the sky.",
  ["100220101_5"]="Could it have been just an illusion?",
  ["100220101_6"]="However, in the next moment, a sizable green and white figure comes into view.",
  ["100220101_7"]="The gigantic bird seems almost within her reach.",
  ["100220101_8"]="Even the flow of time appears to slow down in this moment.",
  ["100220101_9"]="As the bird's wings rustle, ribbons of greenish light dance over its white plumage.",
  ["100220102_1"]="Each time she gazes skyward in anticipation, no new discoveries greet her.",
  ["100220102_10"]="...",
  ["100220102_11"]="So what? So I wouldn't have come here, searching for the giant bird?",
  ["100220102_12"]="Ming stops. Even in solitude, she refrains from expressing any words of regret.",
  ["100220102_13"]="Kneeling on the ground, she buries her face in her arms.",
  ["100220102_14"]="(Even if I had seen this coming, I'd have come here anyway.)",
  ["100220102_15"]="(I'm not regretting this.)",
  ["100220102_16"]="...",
  ["100220102_17"]="(Will Grandpa realize I'm gone?)",
  ["100220102_18"]="(Maybe I should leave some marks along the way...? Could Grandpa track them and find me?)",
  ["100220102_19"]="Grandpa...",
  ["100220102_2"]="The sky remains grim as if the bird had never appeared.",
  ["100220102_20"]="There you are, Ming.",
  ["100220102_21"]="A familiar voice jolts Ming's attention.",
  ["100220102_22"]="Within the darkness, a familiar lamp illuminates the space, carried by none other than Ming's dear grandfather.",
  ["100220102_23"]="Grandpa!",
  ["100220102_24"]="The old man gently shakes the lamp staff in his hand, rousing Ming from her reverie, prompting her to rise and approach him.",
  ["100220102_25"]="With the glow of the small lamp, they traverse the darkness together.",
  ["100220102_26"]="Following a brief interlude of silence, Ming speaks first.",
  ["100220102_27"]="Grandpa, I'm sorry...",
  ["100220102_28"]="I wandered off so far...",
  ["100220102_29"]="The old man peers down at his granddaughter, the lamp casting a shadowy glow on her face, obscuring her expression.",
  ["100220102_3"]="Though she persists, she gradually strays until she is completely diverted from the main road into utter darkness.",
  ["100220102_30"]="Even so, he can sense the disappointment on her face in that moment.",
  ["100220102_31"]="He lets out a slow sigh.",
  ["100220102_32"]="I'm relieved to see that you're safe.",
  ["100220102_33"]="So, are you going to tell Grandpa what happened?",
  ["100220102_34"]="You didn't just go all the way out here for no reason, right?",
  ["100220102_35"]="...",
  ["100220102_36"]="Well, the old man from the neighborhood already gave me the lowdown.",
  ["100220102_37"]="...What did he say?",
  ["100220102_38"]="He said that you took off and didn't return after dark, thinking you were too caught up in playing.",
  ["100220102_39"]="But I wasn't!",
  ["100220102_4"]="She has ventured too far away.",
  ["100220102_40"]="I wasn't caught up in playing...",
  ["100220102_41"]="So, what really happened?",
  ["100220102_42"]="I saw... a huge green and white bird.",
  ["100220102_43"]="A colossal bird that appeared out of nowhere, only to vanish into thin air.",
  ["100220102_44"]="No one but her had glimpsed its figure or heard its chirp.",
  ["100220102_45"]="Ming recounts the spectacle to her grandfather.",
  ["100220102_46"]="The old man seems lost in thought. He has already spoken to the child and the elder in the courtyard, and now he hears yet another version of the story from his granddaughter.",
  ["100220102_47"]="Nobody believed me, but I swear I was telling the truth... It couldn't have been my imagination!",
  ["100220102_48"]="Ming grows increasingly uneasy at her grandfather's silence.",
  ["100220102_49"]="You don't believe me either, Grandpa?",
  ["100220102_5"]="Amidst the unfamiliar darkness, a tinge of fear creeps into her mind.",
  ["100220102_50"]="Rather than answer her question, the old man steers the conversation in an unexpected direction.",
  ["100220102_51"]="Well, when we get back, I'll open up a whole new world of knowledge for you.",
  ["100220102_52"]="And you can start reading the books in my study too. Well, as long as you can make sense of all those words.",
  ["100220102_53"]="Yeah, maybe we should start with a peek into the dictionary.",
  ["100220102_54"]="His thoughts stray to his granddaughter's future teaching endeavors.",
  ["100220102_55"]="But how does this tie in...",
  ["100220102_56"]="What even is that gigantic bird? Where did it come from? And where is it headed? Don't you want to find out?",
  ["100220102_57"]="...!",
  ["100220102_58"]="So, you're actually believing what I'm saying, Grandpa!",
  ["100220102_59"]="A gentle smile forms on the old man's face.",
  ["100220102_6"]="W-what's this place...?",
  ["100220102_60"]="Any ideas on how I can find it, Grandpa?",
  ["100220102_61"]="Nope, I'm clueless on that too.",
  ["100220102_62"]="He responds with a firm shake of his head.",
  ["100220102_63"]="Hmm... Grandma mentioned you have a talent for fortune-telling. Can you predict if I'll ever find it again?",
  ["100220102_64"]="No, not even I can foresee that.",
  ["100220102_65"]="Oh...",
  ["100220102_66"]="After some time, Ming begins to feel drowsy, and her grandfather gently carries her on his back.",
  ["100220102_67"]="Only the stars and the moon bear witness as they journey home under the night sky.",
  ["100220102_68"]="In the stillness, Ming's muffled but resolute voice reaches her grandfather's ears.",
  ["100220102_69"]="But when will I get to see it again...?",
  ["100220102_7"]="*Sob*",
  ["100220102_70"]="The old man chuckles softly.",
  ["100220102_71"]="Maybe it's around here, or maybe it's somewhere else. Maybe you'll catch a glimpse of it tomorrow, or maybe you'll never see it again...",
  ["100220102_72"]="...",
  ["100220102_73"]="Ming appears to have drifted into sleep, unresponsive to his words.",
  ["100220102_74"]="Yet only she knows that, before succumbing to slumber, her thoughts wandered...",
  ["100220102_75"]="Perhaps by the next dawn, or when she has read every book at home, or when she has a lamp staff to light her path in the dark, or perhaps when she is finally prepared for it all...",
  ["100220102_76"]="Perhaps by then...",
  ["100220102_8"]="It's really dark here...",
  ["100220102_9"]="If I had seen this coming...",
  ["100220201_1"]="Field Investigation",
  ["100220201_10"]="Grandpa?",
  ["100220201_100"]="So, a field investigation, huh...? Seems fitting for a counselor.",
  ["100220201_101"]="Well... that's true.",
  ["100220201_11"]="Before she can ask anything, her grandfather shifts to another topic.",
  ["100220201_12"]="It's time for you to head to QingYu City as a counselor.",
  ["100220201_13"]="Me?",
  ["100220201_14"]="Yeah, with all those books you've been reading, wouldn't you like to see those historical sites up close?",
  ["100220201_15"]="Absolutely!",
  ["100220201_16"]="But aren't you the counselor, Grandpa?",
  ["100220201_17"]="That role is now yours. I've sorted everything on my end. It's up to you now.",
  ["100220201_18"]="This old man can't handle such a long journey anymore...",
  ["100220201_19"]="You can go there on my behalf and gain some valuable insights.",
  ["100220201_2"]="In the years that followed, Ming has never glimpsed that colossal bird again.",
  ["100220201_20"]="Insights? But a counselor... I remember when you were a counselor, Grandpa, you solved so many problems, right? So, what does a counselor do?",
  ["100220201_21"]="A knowing smile forms on the old man's lips.",
  ["100220201_22"]="Once you're there, you'll figure it out.",
  ["100220201_23"]="That sounds mysterious...",
  ["100220201_24"]="QingYu City, Hanze Region, Qian.",
  ["100220201_25"]="QingYu City, the very root of Qian's history, stands at the river's source, observing the changes across this vast land.",
  ["100220201_26"]="The ancient and mysterious traces left in this city over centuries have drawn countless scholars to its gates.",
  ["100220201_27"]="Ming is one of them.",
  ["100220201_28"]="Immersed in years of study and her quest for the giant bird, she delves into folklore, history, and related fields.",
  ["100220201_29"]="As a special counselor to the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity, she contemplates the various tasks awaiting her in QingYu City.",
  ["100220201_3"]="Yet, as she immerses herself in the cryptic pages of ancient books, she unravels the marvelous insights her ancestors had spotted within those aged tomes.",
  ["100220201_30"]="From curating antiquities and exploring folk traditions to translating and proofreading ancient texts... the tasks are varied yet interconnected by common threads.",
  ["100220201_31"]="Little does she realize that this is only her imagination at play...",
  ["100220201_32"]="Inside a community hall.",
  ["100220201_33"]="You're new to this place, Ming. I'm not sure if your grandfather has filled you in much about this city. It's known for its ancient history and cultural relics...",
  ["100220201_34"]="The study of folklore always ties into this city's history. Yeah, I did my homework before coming.",
  ["100220201_35"]="Oh... I meant the locals here.",
  ["100220201_36"]="Locals?",
  ["100220201_37"]="Yes, many of the residents in QingYu City hold onto... traditional values.",
  ["100220201_38"]="Traditional values?",
  ["100220201_39"]="Ming intends to ask about further details when she is interrupted.",
  ["100220201_4"]="She senses faintly that the fleeting glimpse from her childhood may have been her closest encounter with myth.",
  ["100220201_40"]="There you are, Counselor Ming!",
  ["100220201_41"]="The lecture is about to begin. Please come with me.",
  ["100220201_42"]="Stay wary of frauds and scams. That's our today's topic.",
  ["100220201_43"]="Simply put: Don't listen. Don't trust. Don't transfer money.",
  ["100220201_44"]="And if you notice anything suspicious, report it to the community immediately.",
  ["100220201_45"]="Also, you can seek advice from Ming Xiaomin, our special counselor for folk affairs.",
  ["100220201_46"]="Just call me Ming. Feel free to ask me anything.",
  ["100220201_47"]="As applause fills the room, Ming adjusts her hair and steps down from the podium.",
  ["100220201_48"]="(Is it really a counselor's job to handle these tasks...? To support public education efforts?)",
  ["100220201_49"]="Counselor Ming!",
  ["100220201_5"]="Fortunately, that brief encounter sparked her enduring interest in such knowledge.",
  ["100220201_50"]="Huh?",
  ["100220201_51"]="Ugh... do you need my help with something?",
  ["100220201_52"]="Here's the thing: someone approached me, claiming to be a descendant of the First Emperor...",
  ["100220201_53"]="He mentioned he was searching for his relatives and suggested that I might belong to a branch of the Ji Clan.",
  ["100220201_54"]="He needs a bit of financial support to acquire tools to unlock secret locks and access a passage into the royal palace.",
  ["100220201_55"]="His proposal does sound plausible, doesn't it? My family has roots in this city for generations, so there could be a connection...",
  ["100220201_56"]="What do you think I should do? Should I be generous with his request? Or maybe take a more cautious approach?",
  ["100220201_57"]="Historical records show that Ji Xia didn't have any descendants.",
  ["100220201_58"]="I get that you're familiar with the history from textbooks, but our local stories tell a different tale.",
  ["100220201_59"]="...",
  ["100220201_6"]="Unfortunately, the deeper she delves into the subject, the stronger her yearning grows to witness that giant bird once more.",
  ["100220201_60"]="While you're a counselor, Ming, you might not be fully aware of this city's deep history, especially concerning Ji Xia. It's not something easily explained in just a couple of books. But my point is something different...",
  ["100220201_61"]="What exactly would you like to know?",
  ["100220201_62"]="If, just a big if, I gain access to the legendary mausoleum through the secret passage, what share of the treasures would I receive, considering my distant lineage?",
  ["100220201_63"]="And have you ever estimated the value of the treasures inside the mausoleum?",
  ["100220201_64"]="...",
  ["100220201_65"]="Do you have any knowledge about talisman paper?",
  ["100220201_66"]="Yeah, when we dive into a particular culture, we tend to explore various facets of it.",
  ["100220201_67"]="If so, do you know of any talisman that claims to cure all illnesses?",
  ["100220201_68"]="...",
  ["100220201_69"]="I really think you should go to a proper hospital.",
  ["100220201_7"]="Despite countless sunrises, numerous books read, and her grandfather passing his lamp staff to her, the bird remains elusive.",
  ["100220201_70"]="...Hah, as I suspected. Getting an elixir of life can't be that simple.",
  ["100220201_71"]="I'm sorry. I'm just a bit desperate trying to catch at a straw.",
  ["100220201_72"]="Looks like this might not be the best place to discuss such matters... Sorry for bothering you.",
  ["100220201_73"]="...",
  ["100220201_74"]="Counselor Ming!",
  ["100220201_75"]="Please go ahead...",
  ["100220201_76"]="After concluding her consultation session, Ming exhales a heavy sigh.",
  ["100220201_77"]="How was your first day as a counselor?",
  ["100220201_78"]="...Draining.",
  ["100220201_79"]="Why would they even ask such questions...?",
  ["100220201_8"]="Aren't you tired of craning your neck all the time?",
  ["100220201_80"]="I struggled to find answers...",
  ["100220201_81"]="Now I see what you meant by \"traditional values\"...",
  ["100220201_82"]="Despite the Beacon lying dormant for years without any real anomalies occurring, the locals persist in believing what they wish to believe.",
  ["100220201_83"]="And QingYu City is an ancient city with a rich history.",
  ["100220201_84"]="Despite the constant efforts from the Bureau of Culture & Tourism and Bureau of Civil Security, the results... Well, you've seen it firsthand.",
  ["100220201_85"]="It seems the counselor's role covers a broader spectrum than I thought.",
  ["100220201_86"]="True, we've never had a lecture like today's before your arrival. It was a recent joint effort between the Bureau of Culture & Tourism and Bureau of Civil Security, coinciding with your appointment by the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity.",
  ["100220201_87"]="Well, take your time.",
  ["100220201_88"]="By the way, even though you're a counselor on paper, we have other tasks.",
  ["100220201_89"]="Other tasks?",
  ["100220201_9"]="One afternoon, as Ming pores over ancient texts in her study, her grandfather breaks the silence.",
  ["100220201_90"]="Why the hurry in summoning me here?",
  ["100220201_91"]="I heard that Master Yuanquan is also coming. Is something serious going on?",
  ["100220201_92"]="I'm not sure about the details, but Master Yuanquan has requested us to gather information before his arrival.",
  ["100220201_93"]="Gathering information...",
  ["100220201_94"]="I'll start by looking over the latest weather reports. What about you?",
  ["100220201_95"]="...",
  ["100220201_96"]="Spend more time outdoors.",
  ["100220201_97"]="A thousand miles walked outweighs a thousand books read.",
  ["100220201_98"]="Exploring bustling spaces surpasses meditating in serene places.",
  ["100220201_99"]="I'll check out the neighborhood.",
  ["100220301_1"]="Art of Persuasion",
  ["100220301_10"]="What do you think about this, Counselor Ming?",
  ["100220301_11"]="He casts a desperate glance in Ming's direction.",
  ["100220301_12"]="(Eyes widening.)",
  ["100220301_13"]="(What should I say?)",
  ["100220301_14"]="(I'm pretty sure it's a scam! But how do I make my friend see reason?)",
  ["100220301_15"]="The only problem with that fortune-teller is his high fees... No, no. It's not his fault—it's mine!",
  ["100220301_16"]="After all, he can do extraordinary things like washing his hands in boiling oil and summoning fire with a snap. It's natural for him to charge a premium!",
  ["100220301_17"]="Counselor Ming is a feng shui expert. Why not have her talk to the fortune-teller and see if he's overcharging?",
  ["100220301_18"]="Ming takes a deep breath.",
  ["100220301_19"]="...",
  ["100220301_2"]="Inside a community hall.",
  ["100220301_20"]="In ancient times, there was a county where the local custom involved a \"River Lord\" demanding women be sacrificed into the river, or the county would face floods.",
  ["100220301_21"]="What would you do in that situation?",
  ["100220301_22"]="Of course I'd expose that witch's lies.",
  ["100220301_23"]="How would you do that?",
  ["100220301_24"]="I'd reveal the truth about the \"River Lord.\"",
  ["100220301_25"]="What if they don't believe you?",
  ["100220301_26"]="Why wouldn't they? I'm speaking the truth.",
  ["100220301_27"]="How do you prove what you're saying is true?",
  ["100220301_28"]="I...",
  ["100220301_29"]="Spotting a scam isn't the hard part. The real challenge is convincing those who have been tricked to believe you.",
  ["100220301_3"]="Standing on the podium with a resigned expression, Ming engages in the routine consultation.",
  ["100220301_30"]="You need to be more convincing than the witch.",
  ["100220301_31"]="So, how did they resolve the issue in the end?",
  ["100220301_32"]="When the magistrate got wind of the matter, he asked the witch to personally apologize to the River Lord for the sacrifice not meeting expectations and threw the witch into the river.",
  ["100220301_33"]="...",
  ["100220301_34"]="So, if I want to convince others, do I need to throw someone into the river?",
  ["100220301_35"]="...No, that's not the idea.",
  ["100220301_36"]="...",
  ["100220301_37"]="You need to be more convincing than the witch.",
  ["100220301_38"]="Vinegar, or perhaps borax?",
  ["100220301_39"]="Huh?",
  ["100220301_4"]="Counselor Ming! I've got a problem here!",
  ["100220301_40"]="So, he was \"washing his hands\" in a pot with boiling oil? I think he added vinegar or borax to give the illusion of boiling oil.",
  ["100220301_41"]="But the fire...",
  ["100220301_42"]="It's a simple trick using white phosphorus.",
  ["100220301_43"]="Or maybe he used something else...",
  ["100220301_44"]="But...",
  ["100220301_45"]="He seems to know everything about what's been happening to me lately!",
  ["100220301_46"]="(This sounds more like information leakage...)",
  ["100220301_47"]="Well, if that fortune-teller performed in front of you, he's not a hermit but someone making a living from his skills. Why not invite him to the Bureau of Civil Security for registration?",
  ["100220301_48"]="In our line of work, whether it's fortune-telling, feng shui, conducting rites, or exorcisms, all practitioners must be registered with the Bureau of Civil Security.",
  ["100220301_49"]="R-register?",
  ["100220301_5"]="Please go ahead...",
  ["100220301_50"]="Yes, because all transactions related to these practices are subject to taxes.",
  ["100220301_51"]="T-taxes?",
  ["100220301_52"]="I see... It adds to credibility because it's all done legally!",
  ["100220301_53"]="I didn't realize there were so many regulations...",
  ["100220301_54"]="Now that the Bureau of Civil Security staff is here, instead of bringing the fortune-teller here, why not lead him to the Bureau yourself—it shows your sincerity.",
  ["100220301_55"]="That makes sense! You're quite professional, Counselor Ming!",
  ["100220301_56"]="Ming breathes a sigh of relief, watching as the resident approaches the Bureau of Civil Security staff.",
  ["100220301_57"]="This should do the trick...",
  ["100220301_58"]="By the way, do you really have to pay taxes, Counselor Ming?",
  ["100220301_59"]="Well, when you buy joss incense... I mean, engage in certain transactions... taxes apply, right?",
  ["100220301_6"]="Lately, there have been disturbances at home. I haven't told anyone about this, but...",
  ["100220301_60"]="...",
  ["100220301_61"]="Since you know about your friend's situation, assist him in explaining everything to the Bureau of Civil Security... and remind our staff to be prepared for work.",
  ["100220301_62"]="Oh! Yeah, yeah! Thank you, Counselor Ming!",
  ["100220301_63"]="Last time, you asked about the possible penalty for pretending to be a Ji Clan member, trespassing in a cultural reserve, and stealing artifacts, right?",
  ["100220301_64"]="What? But I came here for advice... Hold on, what if I... What if I'm actually from a branch of the Ji Clan?",
  ["100220301_65"]="All artifacts must be surrendered to the authorities. Even if you were Ji Xia himself, stealing artifacts would land you in jail.",
  ["100220301_66"]="The privileges of royal family members and nobles in Qian have long been gone.",
  ["100220301_67"]="Even Ji Xia himself, if guilty, would face the same consequences as any other citizen.",
  ["100220301_68"]="...",
  ["100220301_69"]="By the way, did that so-called descendant of Ji Xia approach you again for money? And did you send him any? It's not too late to report this to the Bureau of Civil Security.",
  ["100220301_7"]="A few days ago, I met a fortune-teller who saw through my troubles.",
  ["100220301_70"]="Right... the Bureau of Civil Security!",
  ["100220301_71"]="...",
  ["100220301_72"]="...",
  ["100220301_73"]="If so, do you know of any talisman that claims to cure all illnesses?",
  ["100220301_74"]="(He never came back...)",
  ["100220301_75"]="(Maybe he sought help at the hospital...?)",
  ["100220301_76"]="I hope I'm handling things correctly today...",
  ["100220301_8"]="And he was even accurate about some of my personal matters! That was incredible!",
  ["100220301_9"]="That fortune-teller seems sketchy to me.",
  ["100220401_1"]="Through the Mist",
  ["100220401_10"]="Dear residents of QingYu City, based on our city's warning signal criteria, we are issuing a red mist warning signal.",
  ["100220401_11"]="As a safety precaution, all classes and work will be halted during the mist. Please minimize outdoor activities and avoid unnecessary travel.",
  ["100220401_12"]="Let's all work together to ensure everyone's safety.",
  ["100220401_13"]="Counselor Ming, the system shows that some street lights in your area are malfunctioning and haven't been activated.",
  ["100220401_14"]="Understood. I'll take care of them.",
  ["100220401_15"]="Huh? Do you know how to activate street lights?",
  ["100220401_16"]="I'm familiar with the responsibilities of a counselor.",
  ["100220401_17"]="Huh? The Bureau of Oversight & Integrity never mentioned this...",
  ["100220401_18"]="Well, I'm leaving.",
  ["100220401_19"]="Stay safe, Counselor Ming!",
  ["100220401_2"]="After analyzing the information they have collectively gathered, the WeiShi members present their initial findings.",
  ["100220401_3"]="Those peculiar and inexplicable occurrences, imperceptible to ordinary eyes, are unmistakably anomalies.",
  ["100220401_4"]="Master Yuanquan has set a departure date and will be arriving in a few days.",
  ["100220401_5"]="I see.",
  ["100220401_6"]="The presence of anomalies heralds the awakening of the Beacon.",
  ["100220401_7"]="In preparation for potential crises, WeiShi devises several strategies and swiftly reaches out to the government.",
  ["100220401_8"]="Yet, the situation deteriorates far more rapidly than anyone could have foreseen.",
  ["100220401_9"]="Overnight, a cerulean vapor engulfs the city, casting it in an eerie haze.",
  ["100220501_1"]="Distant Past",
  ["100220501_10"]="Especially with the recent reports of agitated beasts. We can't simply allow them to leave the city... We have a responsibility to the people here.",
  ["100220501_11"]="...",
  ["100220501_12"]="Ancestors, please! Clear this mist!",
  ["100220501_13"]="He must have a good reason.",
  ["100220501_14"]="I understand.",
  ["100220501_15"]="I'll escort the truck and ensure a safe journey.",
  ["100220501_16"]="Counselor Ming!",
  ["100220501_17"]="I thought your role was mainly about promoting science. I didn't expect you to be handling so many diverse duties...",
  ["100220501_18"]="These duties are part of the counselor's role.",
  ["100220501_19"]="I see, Counselor Ming... We'll make arrangements right away!",
  ["100220501_2"]="The mist lingers, and the and the mist lights established by the Bureau of Civil Security are insufficient to dispel the cerulean vapor conjured by the anomaly.",
  ["100220501_20"]="It's you, Counselor Ming!",
  ["100220501_21"]="You can head back. I'll see to escorting the patient out of the city.",
  ["100220501_22"]="Let's prepare for the worst and hope for the best.",
  ["100220501_23"]="...",
  ["100220501_24"]="We'll do our best to prevent any delays.",
  ["100220501_25"]="I... I did a divination before coming here, and it indicates that your sincere offerings have earned blessings from your ancestors.",
  ["100220501_26"]="...Don't worry about it.",
  ["100220501_27"]="...Counselor Ming, so folklore counselors can actually tell fortunes, right?",
  ["100220501_28"]="Well, some can, some can't.",
  ["100220501_29"]="And I... I happen to know a thing or two.",
  ["100220501_3"]="Pensively, Ming examines the lamp staff in her grasp.",
  ["100220501_30"]="Thank you for your kind words.",
  ["100220501_31"]="Thank you for being willing to escort the truck.",
  ["100220501_32"]="Oh, it's you! The sister from the catwalk!",
  ["100220501_33"]="So, you're the one who's unwell and needs to leave the city.",
  ["100220501_34"]="Are you feeling unwell too, sister?",
  ["100220501_35"]="No, I'm here to escort the truck out of the city.",
  ["100220501_36"]="Really? That's impressive!",
  ["100220501_37"]="But... sister? Can you tell me why you're here escorting the truck?",
  ["100220501_38"]="Dad always says \"leave risky tasks to adults,\" but you don't look like an adult, sister.",
  ["100220501_39"]="How come I don't look like an adult?",
  ["100220501_4"]="At that moment, a staff member from the Bureau of Civil Security approaches.",
  ["100220501_40"]="But... you don't seem as mature as Mom or Dad, or the driver!",
  ["100220501_41"]="Hahaha!",
  ["100220501_42"]="Ahem...",
  ["100220501_43"]="I'm here because I'm the Catwalk Lightbringer...",
  ["100220501_44"]="Oh, that's right! And you have that awesome lamp staff!",
  ["100220501_45"]="...",
  ["100220501_46"]="Ming gently shakes the lamp staff in her hand.",
  ["100220501_47"]="Yes... I have this lamp staff.",
  ["100220501_48"]="After a brief journey, the child's initial excitement fades into unease.",
  ["100220501_49"]="I've never been away from Mom and Dad for this long...",
  ["100220501_5"]="Counselor Ming, about the special access you requested earlier...",
  ["100220501_50"]="When will they come for me?",
  ["100220501_51"]="...",
  ["100220501_52"]="Hey... are you curious about what I do for a living?",
  ["100220501_53"]="Huh?",
  ["100220501_54"]="Ming's words immediately capture the child's attention.",
  ["100220501_55"]="Let me explain this with a story... Once upon a time, there was a county where the locals offered young women to the River Lord...",
  ["100220501_56"]="What's this River Lord? And why did they offer young women to him?",
  ["100220501_57"]="Hmm...",
  ["100220501_58"]="An abrupt brake interrupts Ming's story.",
  ["100220501_6"]="The staff member hesitates visibly.",
  ["100220501_7"]="What happened?",
  ["100220501_8"]="We understand the urgency of this patient's situation. If we can't get him out of the city tonight, his condition might worsen.",
  ["100220501_9"]="But the dense mist hasn't lifted yet... and our team is stretched thin. We can only provide a driver. Arranging an escort is proving difficult.",
  ["100220502_1"]="At that moment, a loud, echoing bird chirp breaks the silence from the distant horizon.",
  ["100220502_10"]="The one I saw... could it be one of the many documented by our ancestors?",
  ["100220502_11"]="People can perceive the same thing differently.",
  ["100220502_12"]="...Will I ever have the chance to see it again?",
  ["100220502_13"]="If its appearance signals a disaster, would you still want to see it?",
  ["100220502_14"]="Just remember, even if you never see it again, it might not be a bad thing.",
  ["100220502_15"]="But...",
  ["100220502_16"]="But it were to appear, that's not something I could prevent.",
  ["100220502_17"]="You really want to see it, don't you?",
  ["100220502_18"]="...",
  ["100220502_19"]="I understand. If I had glimpsed it in my youth, I might have found it difficult to let go.",
  ["100220502_2"]="A sizable green and white figure comes into sight.",
  ["100220502_20"]="Grandpa...",
  ["100220502_21"]="Whatever comes next, I'm glad to see you pursuing something meaningful.",
  ["100220502_22"]="If I do see it again... I would follow it, no matter what...",
  ["100220502_23"]="Her long-held wish is almost within reach.",
  ["100220502_24"]="The bird is near, and she feels ready for it. If she gives chase, she might actually catch up with it...",
  ["100220502_25"]="Instinctively, Ming steps toward the direction where the giant bird flies.",
  ["100220502_26"]="Yet, she never takes a second step.",
  ["100220502_27"]="Holding her breath, she stands still, watching the bird as it vanishes into the horizon.",
  ["100220502_28"]="Then, she turns back toward the path from which she came.",
  ["100220502_29"]="Aren't you tired of craning your neck all the time?",
  ["100220502_3"]="As the bird's wings rustle, ribbons of greenish light dance over its white plumage.",
  ["100220502_30"]="Hmph, you were wrong about me, Grandpa.",
  ["100220502_31"]="It's true that she glimpsed it in her youth, and now she finds it difficult to let go.",
  ["100220502_32"]="However...",
  ["100220502_33"]="In the distance, the truck flickers its lights through the dimness, signaling its location to Ming, who may soon return.",
  ["100220502_34"]="At present, there is somewhere more important she must go above all else.",
  ["100220502_35"]="You're back, sister!",
  ["100220502_36"]="I've cleared the path ahead. We're all set to go.",
  ["100220502_37"]="Sure!",
  ["100220502_38"]="So, will you continue the story, sister?",
  ["100220502_39"]="Sure... but let me share another story with you. Once upon a time, there was a young girl who caught sight of a gigantic bird soaring in the sky...",
  ["100220502_4"]="The massive silhouette sweeps over her head, soaring into the distance.",
  ["100220502_40"]="Whoa...",
  ["100220502_41"]="Its presence has been fleeting, leaving no trace in the sky.",
  ["100220502_42"]="There is no proof that the brief moment was anything more than an illusion.",
  ["100220502_43"]="However, Ming no longer seeks such proof.",
  ["100220502_44"]="Deep down, she knows that she has indeed caught a glimpse of it once again.",
  ["100220502_45"]="And she understands that this sighting may not be a fortunate sign.",
  ["100220502_46"]="Ming surveys the grim scene around her.",
  ["100220502_47"]="The scene stirs thoughts of recent misfortunes and passages from ancient texts.",
  ["100220502_48"]="But...",
  ["100220502_49"]="Misfortune might be a blessing in disguise, and vice versa...",
  ["100220502_5"]="There exists a bird known as Luan, resembling a scops owl with vibrant feathers. Its presence is believed to bring peace to the world.",
  ["100220502_50"]="Ming exhales a heavy sigh.",
  ["100220502_51"]="Still, she can't help but smile.",
  ["100220502_52"]="After all, it is the marvel she has pursued for so long and finally beheld once more.",
  ["100220502_53"]="I've truly witnessed it once more...",
  ["100220502_54"]="After the escort, Ming reunites with Yuanquan and other WeiShi elites outside the city.",
  ["100220502_55"]="Master Yuanquan.",
  ["100220502_56"]="I've been briefed on everything. You've done remarkable work during this time.",
  ["100220502_57"]="Unfortunately, our communication network is down now. Before your arrival, your grandfather mentioned that he would like you to confirm a safe journey.",
  ["100220502_58"]="Yeah, I'll do it once the communication is restored.",
  ["100220502_59"]="I have plenty of new insights to share with him this time.",
  ["100220502_6"]="There exists a bird known as Peng, enormous in size comparable to Mount Tai, with wings that spread like clouds across the sky.",
  ["100220502_60"]="Eventually, Ming has witnessed that bird once more.",
  ["100220502_61"]="Without indulging in her emotions, Ming extends her lamp staff to Yuanquan.",
  ["100220502_62"]="It seems my lamp staff can temporarily disperse the cerulean vapor.",
  ["100220502_63"]="I'm not sure if it's the staff's properties or the cerulean vapor itself, but I can lend the staff to WeiShi for further study if needed.",
  ["100220502_64"]="Regardless of its effectiveness, I'm concerned about the cerulean vapor worsening, so I suggest we start evacuating soon.",
  ["100220502_65"]="I've also drafted a basic plan for relocating the residents.",
  ["100220502_66"]="The childhood longing has been fulfilled at last. She will cherish that fleeting moment in the days ahead, but for now, she has many tasks at hand.",
  ["100220502_67"]="By the way, once this situation is resolved... Can I take on other roles as the \"Special Folklore Counselor from the Bureau of Oversight & Integrity\"?",
  ["100220502_68"]="Oh, like what?",
  ["100220502_69"]="Maybe... organizing daily science exhibitions, perhaps?",
  ["100220502_7"]="There exists a bird known as Shengyu, resembling a scops owl with red feathers. It feeds on fish, and its call is similar to that of a deer. Its arrival is said to bring floods.",
  ["100220502_8"]="There exists a bird that resembles a crane, but with only one leg. It has cerulean plumage with red markings and a white beak.",
  ["100220502_9"]="The records of that giant bird are scattered with conflicting accounts...",
  ["100221101_1"]="The Moon and the Viola",
  ["100221101_10"]="Nanna wipes the book spine clean and places it in the remaining space on the bookshelf.",
  ["100221101_11"]="Stepping back, she assesses the outcome of her tidying efforts: a freshly organized reading room where books are sorted by content and placed on shelves based on size and thickness.",
  ["100221101_12"]="Great. This is how a reading room should look.",
  ["100221101_13"]="Now, I just need to return these books to their proper shelves.",
  ["100221101_14"]="Nanna glances at the pile of books on the desk awaiting re-categorization. In most sectors that she checks, she tends to come across various misclassification cases.",
  ["100221101_15"]="Rather than being daunted by the additional workload, Nanna finds this task uplifting, putting her in a good mood.",
  ["100221101_16"]="Piano Repair Manuals, A Guide to Guitar Crafting and Maintenance... These belong in their respective areas.",
  ["100221101_17"]="Let's hustle and pack up. Time is of essence.",
  ["100221101_2"]="The Tower of Babel, soaring above the clouds, harbors countless chambers within its walls. Here, bookshelves extend like fields of wisdom, and pages stand as tributes to curiosity.",
  ["100221101_3"]="They await the activation of the Beacon, enabling the exploration of temporal dimensions and unveiling myriad possibilities.",
  ["100221101_4"]="Among the many unique chambers inside the tower, there is an enormous private study encircled by shelves arranged in circles like ripples.",
  ["100221101_5"]="These shelves do not house journals, research papers, or reports concerning C.A.V.E., but rather meticulous personal records written by someone.",
  ["100221101_6"]="These writings, carefully composed, do not merely chronicle events but strive to capture moments witnessed, experienced, and cherished.",
  ["100221101_7"]="To encapsulate this essence, the term \"diary\" would be the appropriate term.",
  ["100221101_8"]="October 3&The Library remains closed today.&Communication flows smoothly within C.A.V.E.&As usual, my routine tasks involve organizing and archiving specific documents&Although the Tower of Babel has become a legend, our responsibilities as Eme-an persist unchanged. Even when we lurk in the shadows, there is a lot of maintenance work awaiting us.&Keeping things in order is crucial for smooth operations. I believe this principle extends to both books and musical instruments.",
  ["100221101_9"]="Alright, this should be the final one.",
  ["100221102_1"]="Hey, the repair shop is bustling today.",
  ["100221102_10"]="Go ahead. I'll fill her in on it later.",
  ["100221102_11"]="Without delay, Ereshan swiftly takes the items she has stored in the repair shop and turns towards the door.",
  ["100221102_12"]="Take care on your way, Ere, and remember to report back next time.",
  ["100221102_13"]="The unexpected visitor departs quickly, leaving Viola and Nanna alone in the repair shop once more.",
  ["100221102_14"]="Observing Nanna's face, Viola hesitates before eventually voicing her thoughts.",
  ["100221102_15"]="This feels incredible...",
  ["100221102_16"]="Despite us being close in age, you always come across as more like an elder... or a mentor, Nanna.",
  ["100221102_17"]="You're the one handling most things when the Head Librarian is away...",
  ["100221102_18"]="Upon hearing Viola's exclamation, Nanna chuckles softly.",
  ["100221102_19"]="True. As for the reason... Sorry, but that's my little secret.",
  ["100221102_2"]="A girl's voice rings at the entrance—it's Ereshan holding her scythe in hand.",
  ["100221102_20"]="But I bet that's not what you're really itching to ask, is it? You're curious about Ere, right?",
  ["100221102_21"]="Viola, sensing that her thoughts are transparent, briefly averts her gaze before continuing.",
  ["100221102_22"]="Yeah, it's surprising she could leave the tower without any restrictions...",
  ["100221102_23"]="If I could do the same...",
  ["100221102_24"]="After replacing the filter cartridge, Viola carefully strokes the strings, with the viola case remaining open.",
  ["100221102_25"]="Noticing Viola's subtle movements and emotions, Nanna pauses momentarily before speaking.",
  ["100221102_26"]="You know... when Ere applied for her first field operation, she didn't meet all the requirements, but I believed in her abilities and backed her up.",
  ["100221102_27"]="If you're keen on a field operation, I can vouch for you as well.",
  ["100221102_28"]="We've got reports of Nemesis activities in Cyril. Are you interested?",
  ["100221102_29"]="Hearing Nanna's words, Viola's eyes brighten with expectation.",
  ["100221102_3"]="Catching sight of her fully armed, Nanna seems a bit surprised.",
  ["100221102_30"]="I... I am interested. C-can I be part of the operation?",
  ["100221102_31"]="Heh, that's the spirit. Just give me a heads-up whenever you need help in the future.",
  ["100221102_32"]="Although Viola hasn't performed with her viola publicly since entering the Tower, seeing her well-maintained instrument still reminds me of her past actions.&While expressing oneself through music is fine, not everyone can handle her emotions.&She has a kind soul, and I'm certain that one day, she'll learn how to channel both her viola and her power in the right manner.",
  ["100221102_4"]="Ere? You've got another field operation?",
  ["100221102_5"]="But you've barely returned. Did you report to Zero? What about the report from the last operation?",
  ["100221102_6"]="Ereshan appears impatient at Nanna's concerns.",
  ["100221102_7"]="Report to her? Huh, since when did she become the Head Librarian?",
  ["100221102_8"]="As for the report... No matter what I write and submit, it just keeps getting rejected. Seems like a waste of both our time, don't you think?",
  ["100221102_9"]="Well, okay then.",
  ["100221201_1"]="The Duties of an Adult",
  ["100221201_2"]="November 2&The Library remains closed today, and Eme-an's routine carries on as usual.&The only disturbance was a disagreement between Ere and Zero, though it was settled peacefully.&When Cosmos brought Zero here, announcing her as his successor, I saw this coming. However, now all I can do is step in when they clash.&You sure know how to stir things up, Cosmos.&Ere's been getting more aggressive towards Zero lately, and playing mediator is becoming a regular task... I wonder how long this will go on?&Well, patience is key. Maybe they'll get on better terms in the future.\"",
  ["100221202_1"]="If to summarize the bout using Shamash's style, it would be described as \"intense.\"",
  ["100221202_10"]="Nanna chuckles without replying.",
  ["100221202_11"]="Feeling calmer now?",
  ["100221202_12"]="How about we grab a drink and chat?",
  ["100221202_13"]="With a bright smile, Nanna extends her hand towards Ereshan.",
  ["100221202_14"]="However, Ereshan hesitates before redirecting her gaze to the audience seat.",
  ["100221202_15"]="Forget it, I know what's on your mind.",
  ["100221202_16"]="Why not ask our Miss Protagonist? The next Head Librarian can surely explain everything clearly.",
  ["100221202_17"]="Puzzled, Nanna blinks and follows her line of sight.",
  ["100221202_18"]="A short-haired girl is standing beside Shamash, seemingly appearing out of nowhere.",
  ["100221202_19"]="Hey, I...",
  ["100221202_2"]="Both Nanna and her disciple Ereshan exhibit remarkable speed, their attacks exchanging rapidly on the field. When the dust settles, it is evident that Nanna holds the advantage.",
  ["100221202_20"]="Before Nanna can say anything, the red-haired girl already vanishes.",
  ["100221202_21"]="I'm not here to convince you to reconcile with Zero...",
  ["100221202_22"]="Ah, that girl.",
  ["100221202_23"]="Nanna.",
  ["100221202_24"]="Are you here looking for Ere, Zero?",
  ["100221202_25"]="No. The noise from the training ground was disrupting the librarians, so I came to check it out.",
  ["100221202_26"]="Don't worry about it. Ere isn't upset anymore.",
  ["100221202_27"]="She was... upset?",
  ["100221202_28"]="Zero ponders for a while.",
  ["100221202_29"]="Yeah, any idea why?",
  ["100221202_3"]="Eventually, the bout concludes with Ereshan's defeat. Nanna sheathes her weapon, abandoning her aggressive stance.",
  ["100221202_30"]="This time, Zero nods decisively.",
  ["100221202_31"]="I believe it's because I rejected her request for a field operation.",
  ["100221202_32"]="Ereshan still needs a thorough evaluation of all her skills and approval before becoming a full-fledged field agent.",
  ["100221202_33"]="After reviewing her credentials and considering her usual performance, I don't think she's quite qualified yet, but it seems she's unhappy with the decision.",
  ["100221202_34"]="The girl's voice maintains an indifferent tone, methodically narrating the facts. Even though she is physically present before Nanna, it feels as if her voice is coming from a distance.",
  ["100221202_35"]="The interaction between the two markedly different girls, one akin to lava and the other to ice, presents a challenging prospect for both. Contemplating this peculiar scenario, Nanna finds herself unable to suppress a chuckle.",
  ["100221202_36"]="I see, all because of a submission. Not a big deal.",
  ["100221202_37"]="...",
  ["100221202_38"]="What are your thoughts on this, Shamash?",
  ["100221202_39"]="Ereshan.",
  ["100221202_4"]="Phew, how was that? Are you satisfied?",
  ["100221202_40"]="Capable.",
  ["100221202_41"]="...",
  ["100221202_42"]="You've seen the spar between us, right, Zero?",
  ["100221202_43"]="...Yes, Ereshan's prowess doesn't quite match what I've read in the archives. It surpasses my expectations.",
  ["100221202_44"]="Zero lowers her head in contemplation.",
  ["100221202_45"]="Seeing this, Nanna smiles gently, exchanges a glance with Shamash, and nods.",
  ["100221202_46"]="How about this, Zero? Could you review Ere's application?",
  ["100221202_47"]="Shamash and I know her well and can vouch for her abilities.",
  ["100221202_48"]="The evaluation system is just a guideline. Despite Ere's reluctance to cooperate with you and her lack of experience, I believe she has the potential to excel independently.",
  ["100221202_49"]="That's why I suggest you reconsider her application.",
  ["100221202_5"]="Ereshan remains silent, focusing on catching her breath and regaining her stance.",
  ["100221202_50"]="Shamash nods in approval.",
  ["100221202_51"]="She's capable.",
  ["100221202_52"]="...",
  ["100221202_53"]="Got it.",
  ["100221202_54"]="In that case, I'll review the application again and update Ereshan on the outcomes.",
  ["100221202_55"]="Yeah, that'd be great.",
  ["100221202_56"]="With that settled, Zero pauses briefly before speaking again.",
  ["100221202_57"]="...Thank you. It was a misjudgment on my part due to a lack of knowledge about Ereshan.",
  ["100221202_58"]="I'll take this lesson and strive to avoid similar mistakes in the future.",
  ["100221202_59"]="Zero maintains a serious demeanor while speaking. Seeing this, Nanna reaches out to ruffle her hair as Eme-an's mentor.",
  ["100221202_6"]="Hah... your speed is just unreasonable.",
  ["100221202_60"]="Zero momentarily freezes at the touch before regaining her composure.",
  ["100221202_61"]="It's all right. You handled it well.",
  ["100221202_62"]="You've only been here for a short while. Don't push yourself too hard.",
  ["100221202_63"]="By the way, conversing with Ere has never been easy, not in the past nor now. Both of you need time to get to know each other, my dear.",
  ["100221202_64"]="...",
  ["100221202_65"]="While Nanna is always amiable, Zero sometimes finds it challenging to interact with her.",
  ["100221202_66"]="Meanwhile, Nanna looks pensive, seemingly pondering another topic.",
  ["100221202_67"]="Now that this issue is resolved, how can I make Ere feel better...?",
  ["100221202_68"]="Nanna closes her eyes. In the flickering candlelight, the calm and composed girl with pink hair from the past appears in her mind...",
  ["100221202_69"]="(At least compared back then...)",
  ["100221202_7"]="Well, okay, I'm still no match for you.",
  ["100221202_8"]="You've only been at it for a decade. I mean, if you could easily surpass my decades of experience, that would be quite unfair. But don't worry, you still have plenty of room for improvement.",
  ["100221202_9"]="Wait, how many years did you just say?",
  ["100221301_1"]="Birthday Celebration",
  ["100221301_10"]="How did Ere manage to do that?",
  ["100221301_11"]="Nanna sighs in resignation and leaves the control panel.",
  ["100221301_12"]="At this moment, a young man enters the room, carrying a box and a monolith on his back. The monolith is even taller than him, clearly heavy.",
  ["100221301_13"]="...",
  ["100221301_14"]="Shamash arrives slightly later than scheduled, following Nanna's instructions and carefully holding the cake box along the way.",
  ["100221301_15"]="Due to Ereshan's reserved nature, Nanna has only invited Shamash for this intimate birthday party.",
  ["100221301_16"]="Shamash's proximity in age to Ereshan makes him the ideal guest for the occasion, fostering a bond that would extend through their shared responsibilities within Eme-an in the years to come.",
  ["100221301_17"]="Thank you for coming, Shamash.",
  ["100221301_18"]="The young man shakes his head, indicating \"Don't mention it.\"",
  ["100221301_19"]="Did you run into turrets on your way here too?",
  ["100221301_2"]="November 12&Today is Ere's birthday, and everything went smoothly. The cake and presents were well received.&Well, not everything went perfectly, but Shamash's reliable help was invaluable.&I spent a week preparing for her birthday, selecting the cake size, style, flavor, and decorations... It was more complicated than I thought.&I was worried that she wouldn't like it, but turned out nobody could say no to a good creamy cake.&Picking a gift was the real challenge, even harder than dealing with the C.A.V.E. members.&I don't know her preferences, and Cosmos wasn't much help.&I hope she'll like the gift I picked.",
  ["100221301_20"]="...Numerous.",
  ["100221301_21"]="Just as I suspected. The defense system for the whole area is active now, and the computer room is on high alert.",
  ["100221301_22"]="It's in non-lethal mode, but we need to shut it down or we'll be stuck in the Modern Section.",
  ["100221301_23"]="That girl is really something else...",
  ["100221301_24"]="...Operation.",
  ["100221301_25"]="Central computer.",
  ["100221301_26"]="Hmm? I know we can shut it down using the main computer, but...",
  ["100221301_27"]="Shamash shakes his head again.",
  ["100221301_28"]="Location.",
  ["100221301_29"]="As Nanna pieces together these terms, realization dawns upon her.",
  ["100221301_3"]="The Modern Section of the Tower of Babel always maintains the highest level of security within the entire tower.",
  ["100221301_30"]="Now I understand. Ere is manually testing the defense system here, so she must be at the main computer right now.",
  ["100221301_31"]="Well... looks like we have to make our way to the room and find her.",
  ["100221301_4"]="This section houses the most cutting-edge automated weapons and guard robots, allowing for customizable defense configuration.",
  ["100221301_5"]="After all, the central database of C.A.V.E. is placed in this area, necessitating stringent security measures.",
  ["100221301_6"]="Nanna had not anticipated that the automated defense she personally configured would pose a tricky challenge now.",
  ["100221301_7"]="...",
  ["100221301_8"]="No luck. I've already tried to deactivate the turrets using my permissions, but it's not working.",
  ["100221301_9"]="The operating and control systems are currently occupied... Is she manually adjusting the defense system?",
  ["100221302_1"]="This won't be a walk in the park...",
  ["100221302_10"]="But a birthday is just like any other day, Nanna. It's not something special.",
  ["100221302_11"]="I plan to spend the day enhancing the defense system algorithms and mechanisms. I can finish it before bed, as long as I'm not disturbed.",
  ["100221302_12"]="...",
  ["100221302_13"]="Ere...",
  ["100221302_14"]="Before Nanna starts her lecture, Shamash strides over to the control panel and assumes command.",
  ["100221302_15"]="...?",
  ["100221302_16"]="Ereshan blinks in amazement, fully engrossed by Shamash's expert handling of the controls. Following Ereshan's adjustments, Shamash updates the enemy detection logic and fine-tunes various configurations...",
  ["100221302_17"]="The entire process unfolds smoothly and efficiently.",
  ["100221302_18"]="Having firsthand experience in combat testing the system, Shamash possesses unique insights into the necessary optimizations.",
  ["100221302_19"]="Done.",
  ["100221302_2"]="Passing through thick layers of defense, Nanna and Shamash finally see the girl engrossed in her work at the console.",
  ["100221302_20"]="Upon Shamash's completion, Ereshan promptly initiates a simulation test on the optimized system, which performs admirably during the trial run.",
  ["100221302_21"]="The optimization is remarkable, and you... only used fifteen minutes.",
  ["100221302_22"]="Ereshan's tone carries a mix of complexity, with a touch of enviousness.",
  ["100221302_23"]="Just wrapping up.",
  ["100221302_24"]="...",
  ["100221302_25"]="...Birthday.",
  ["100221302_26"]="Important.",
  ["100221302_27"]="Shamash takes out a glass bottle containing a brown liquid and some sticks, handing them over to Ereshan.",
  ["100221302_28"]="These are...?",
  ["100221302_29"]="Agarwood incense... You're very considerate, Shamash.",
  ["100221302_3"]="Completely absorbed in her task, the girl remains motionless, focusing solely on the data displayed before her as if it were the world's sole necessity.",
  ["100221302_30"]="Ereshan, upon receiving the gift, appears somewhat unsettled. While adept at solving formulas and theorems, assembling intricate models, and analyzing anomalies...",
  ["100221302_31"]="Accepting gifts from others poses a challenge.",
  ["100221302_32"]="Th-thank you for the gift. I... I'll accept it.",
  ["100221302_33"]="Imitating adult behavior, she expresses gratitude and courtesy.",
  ["100221302_34"]="I... I'll get you something in return... in the future.",
  ["100221302_35"]="Watching Ereshan's puzzled expression, Nanna's heart softens. She moves closer, taking Ereshan's hand and offering gentle reassurance.",
  ["100221302_36"]="Ere, just humor us. Let's go and have a birthday party, alright?",
  ["100221302_37"]="Aren't you curious about what I've planned for you?",
  ["100221302_38"]="The birthday party venue, already adorned with decorations, holds a table piled with delectable treats and gift boxes.",
  ["100221302_39"]="With a soft smile, Nanna unwraps the cake box, revealing the cake, candles, dinner plates, and forks.",
  ["100221302_4"]="Ere...",
  ["100221302_40"]="The intricate cake bears the inscription, \"Happy Birthday.\"",
  ["100221302_41"]="Like Shamash said, a birthday isn't just \"another day.\" Your birthday is important, Ere.",
  ["100221302_42"]="Every year, we mark our birthdays and move into a new chapter. A year acts as a milestone that marks our lives.",
  ["100221302_43"]="With each passing year, reflecting on the past and celebrating our birthday helps us understand our place in the world and in history.",
  ["100221302_44"]="This is also how we gather the strength to keep moving forward as we look to the future.",
  ["100221302_45"]="Hmph, spare me the big speech.",
  ["100221302_46"]="Despite her initial reluctance, Ereshan can't help but sneak glances at the beautiful cake presented before her.",
  ["100221302_47"]="The cake, glowing in candlelight, casts a warm light on her youthful face, igniting a spark in her eyes.",
  ["100221302_48"]="Happy birthday, my dear Ere. I hope you'll like this vanilla cake.",
  ["100221302_49"]="Faced with unexpected kindness, the girl hesitates, instinctively resisting it.",
  ["100221302_5"]="Unresponsive, the girl remains fixated on her work.",
  ["100221302_50"]="Yet, in the gentle flicker of the candle's glow, her defenses melt away, and she musters the courage to meet Nanna's gaze.",
  ["100221302_51"]="Th-thank, you... Nanna.",
  ["100221302_52"]="I... I've never had vanilla cake before, but... I think I'll like it.",
  ["100221302_53"]="Her voice gradually softens into a sigh. It is only upon seeing the cake that the glint of restraint fades from her eyes.",
  ["100221302_54"]="The temptations of cream and sugar are irresistible to any child, and Nanna is delighted to see Ereshan yield to its allure.",
  ["100221302_55"]="Have a try. All these are for you.",
  ["100221302_56"]="Just don't forget to make a wish first!",
  ["100221302_57"]="The room dims as night draws near.",
  ["100221302_58"]="The three of them relish the cake and cherish their time together in the cozy setting.",
  ["100221302_59"]="As the birthday celebration winds down, Ereshan, lulled by Nanna's stories, grows drowsy. Eventually, she peacefully drifts off to sleep, leaning against Nanna.",
  ["100221302_6"]="Nanna shakes her head, letting out a soft sigh.",
  ["100221302_60"]="Adjusting their positions, Nanna enfolds Ereshan in a hug and places a soft teddy bear in her arms. The plush toy features a bow matching Ereshan's hair color.",
  ["100221302_61"]="Now resting peacefully, Ereshan appears like any other ordinary girl, watched over by her companions.",
  ["100221302_62"]="...Different.",
  ["100221302_63"]="Shamash remarks in low voice, tinged with confusion.",
  ["100221302_64"]="Nanna responds with a soft chuckle.",
  ["100221302_65"]="Are you saying Ere is different from other children? Or is she behaving unusually today?",
  ["100221302_66"]="She grew up in the Tower of Babel, exposed to a world different from most kids.",
  ["100221302_67"]="Yet... she's still an innocent girl, still growing, with endless potential ahead.",
  ["100221302_68"]="Even though she often wears a stoic expression, she's not cold-hearted.",
  ["100221302_69"]="I know she cries in private when she's hurt, and I see how hard she tries to improve... When will she realize she's a human with her own feelings and dreams, not just a tool to meet others' expectations?",
  ["100221302_7"]="Alright, Ere. Do you remember what day it is?",
  ["100221302_70"]="I hope that one day, Ere will become the person she dreams of being.",
  ["100221302_71"]="But until then, she needs to discover her true desires. The journey to self-discovery is a long one.",
  ["100221302_72"]="The gentle mentor smiles, reaching out to ruffle Shamash's hair.",
  ["100221302_73"]="Shamash, compared to her, you stress me out a lot less. You've always been dependable.",
  ["100221302_74"]="Hmm.",
  ["100221302_75"]="It's wonderful having you at the birthday party. Hopefully, we can do this again next year.",
  ["100221302_76"]="Come on, let's take Ere to her room now.",
  ["100221302_8"]="Without even raising her head, the girl continues her work.",
  ["100221302_9"]="November 12. I know, it's my birthday.",
  ["100221401_1"]="A \"Surprise\" Encounter",
  ["100221401_10"]="Sure thing. What's up? Do you need help updating the tools in the repair shop?",
  ["100221401_11"]="Ninsar shakes her head.",
  ["100221401_12"]="I've been restoring an ancient statue but ran into some challenges... I need to find some old manuscripts.",
  ["100221401_13"]="Those manuscripts are from an ancient time... I think they're in the Ancient Collection Section.",
  ["100221401_14"]="But I can't seem to locate them... Could you help me search for them?",
  ["100221401_15"]="So... you need those manuscripts to solve some problems?",
  ["100221401_16"]="Nanna is surprised at Ninsar's request. Is there really such a statue that prompts Ninsar, the all-knowing one, to delve into manuscripts for answers?",
  ["100221401_17"]="Seeing Ninsha's hesitation, Ninsar subtly clenches her fists. Naturally, Nanna doesn't overlook this subtle shift in her demeanor.",
  ["100221401_18"]="...Sure, I'll help you find them.",
  ["100221401_19"]="Even though Ninsar may be playing games, Nanna chooses to go along, confident that Ninsar won't harbor ill intentions toward her.",
  ["100221401_2"]="Many years ago, an ordinary day in July. As usual, Nanna is attending to her usual duties.",
  ["100221401_20"]="Upon getting Nanna's consent, Ninsar flashes a reassuring smile and nods.",
  ["100221401_21"]="Thank you, Nanna.",
  ["100221401_22"]="Let's go then.",
  ["100221401_3"]="Daily communications, check. Messages for the Head Librarian, check... So, everything is done for today.",
  ["100221401_4"]="It's only evening. It's rare to have so much free time.",
  ["100221401_5"]="Hmmm... maybe I should go for a walk?",
  ["100221401_6"]="However, before the Mentor of Eme-an can enjoy her rare leisure time, a girl scurries from the corridor's far end.",
  ["100221401_7"]="It is Ninsar, the elder sister of the Tasny siblings.",
  ["100221401_8"]="Hmm? What's up, Ninsar?",
  ["100221401_9"]="Nanna... I've been looking for you. Do you have a moment?",
  ["100221402_1"]="<color=#000000>Beyond the exit, a vast expanse unfolds, the blinding glare making it nearly impossible for her to keep her eyes open.</color>",
  ["100221402_10"]="Haha, gotcha! Surprise!",
  ["100221402_11"]="Look who's here, our birthday girl!",
  ["100221402_12"]="Hey, Nanna! I've got a gift for you!",
  ["100221402_13"]="Happy birthday!",
  ["100221402_14"]="Librarians encircle them, some carrying wrapped gifts, others clutching party poppers.",
  ["100221402_15"]="They have all assembled here for one reason—to celebrate Nanna's birthday.",
  ["100221402_16"]="However, the birthday girl remains unaware of what is happening.",
  ["100221402_17"]="Wait, it's... my birthday?",
  ["100221402_18"]="Is it already July 20th?",
  ["100221402_19"]="Gosh, it completely slipped my mind.",
  ["100221402_2"]="<color=#000000>Instinctively, Nanna tightens her grip on her scimitar, shielding Ninsar behind her with one hand while squinting to peer ahead.</color>",
  ["100221402_20"]="A wave of hearty laughter erupts from the cluster of librarians extending their well-wishes.",
  ["100221402_21"]="Hahahahaha! Oh! This is so much fun!",
  ["100221402_22"]="That shocked expression of yours! Priceless! All the puzzle planning paid off, heehee.",
  ["100221402_23"]="It's a shame they removed the maze room where I had more surprises planned, but it all worked out!",
  ["100221402_24"]="I hereby declare: the \"Birthday Scare Project\" is a great success!",
  ["100221402_25"]="Enki? But why... Hold on, what project?",
  ["100221402_26"]="Standing behind Nanna, Ninsar lets out a sigh and walks towards her.",
  ["100221402_27"]="Pay no attention to him. That's not what we named this plan.",
  ["100221402_28"]="But this was our way of throwing you a surprise birthday party, Nanna.",
  ["100221402_29"]="We brainstormed, picked out some fun ideas, and each of us helped set up the secret passages, chambers, gifts, cake, and the party room.",
  ["100221402_3"]="<color=#000000>There is no mistaking it: </color><b><color=#ff0000>someone else</color></b><color=#000000> is there...</color>",
  ["100221402_30"]="Then, I reached out to you and guided you through all the secret chambers we had carefully planned.",
  ["100221402_31"]="And now... it's time for the grand presentation.",
  ["100221402_32"]="Ninsar takes a deep breath and, instead of carrying her suitcase, reaches out to grasp Nanna's hand.",
  ["100221402_33"]="Guiding Nanna to the table, she reveals a box containing an intricate model of the Earth and Moon.",
  ["100221402_34"]="Happy birthday, Nanna. I hope you enjoy it.",
  ["100221402_35"]="At that moment, Nanna notices a subtle blush warming her typically indifferent expression, making her as vibrant as anyone else in the room.",
  ["100221402_36"]="Well wishes and blessings flood towards Nanna through spoken words, smiles, and the shimmering reflections of balloons in the soft light, gradually overwhelming her.",
  ["100221402_37"]="...",
  ["100221402_38"]="Awww...",
  ["100221402_39"]="What a surprise...",
  ["100221402_4"]="Surprise!",
  ["100221402_40"]="This is definitely the best birthday surprise ever...",
  ["100221402_41"]="Thank you, everyone.",
  ["100221402_42"]="Nanna gazes back at the assembled crowd, revealing a genuine smile.",
  ["100221402_43"]="We've been wanting to thank you for so long, Nanna!",
  ["100221402_44"]="Since you joined Eme-an, you've been looking out for me and many others.",
  ["100221402_45"]="With your birthday around the corner, it's only right that we celebrate it in style!",
  ["100221402_46"]="Hey, let's kick off the party now! Enough talking. Who's up for some cake?",
  ["100221402_47"]="We can totally skip the whole \"lighting candles\" part! It's Nanna, after all, right...?",
  ["100221402_48"]="Enki...",
  ["100221402_49"]="...Alright, how about we keep the \"making a wish\" part?",
  ["100221402_5"]="W-what...?!",
  ["100221402_50"]="Nanna chuckles and affectionately ruffle their heads.",
  ["100221402_51"]="Let's skip that too.",
  ["100221402_52"]="I can't think of a better wish than savoring this moment to the fullest.",
  ["100221402_53"]="Joyous moments always seem fleeting.",
  ["100221402_54"]="During her birthday party, Nanna sets aside her mentor role and revels in happiness with her companions.",
  ["100221402_55"]="How will she write this down in her diary? Perhaps she won't dwell on it too much, as there's not much that needs recording.",
  ["100221402_56"]="Nonetheless, this day will be treasured by her as a timeless memory.",
  ["100221402_57"]="July 20&Today is my birthday, a day filled with surprises and joy.&Thank you, everyone.&I love you, too. I love you all.",
  ["100221402_6"]="To her surprise, what meets her eyes isn't the cold gleam of weapon edges but the \"pops\" from party poppers.",
  ["100221402_7"]="Colored ribbons and confetti dance through the air, gently landing on Nanna and Ninsar.",
  ["100221402_8"]="They are welcomed by balloons, flowers, piles of presents, and a cake, all accompanied by a melodic rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" from the announcer.",
  ["100221402_9"]="A large banner proudly proclaims, \"Happy Birthday, Nanna!\"",
  ["100221501_1"]="The Eternal Watcher",
  ["100221501_10"]="She murmurs, uncertain of her words. Nevertheless, she must fulfill this self-appointed task.",
  ["100221501_11"]="Gripping the pen firmly, she carefully forms each letter, aiming to align them neatly along the lines of the diary.",
  ["100221501_12"]="Today... I'm tired. I need some kake.",
  ["100221501_13"]="I've planned this out for days but can't seem to remember it! Note to self: write it on your hand!",
  ["100221501_14"]="Having completed the two sentences, the little girl pauses, looking dissatisfied, and then adds two exclamation marks to the conclusion.",
  ["100221501_15"]="Hmmm? Wait, it's not \"kake,\" is it...?",
  ["100221501_16"]="What was that word again...?",
  ["100221501_17"]="Ohhh, it's \"cake\"! Let me fix that!",
  ["100221501_18"]="Despite her efforts to straighten her posture and lift her spirits, a long yawn escapes her, betraying her body's fatigue.",
  ["100221501_19"]="After fixing the misspelling, she rubs her eyes and resumes writing.",
  ["100221501_2"]="Late into the night, in a private study within the Tower of Babel.",
  ["100221501_20"]="Today, today... Oh, right, I got a new request for help in the inbox. A new librarian needed help finding some books, so I sneaked downstairs to assist.",
  ["100221501_21"]="Books, pens, glasses... there's nothing I can't find in this tower.",
  ["100221501_22"]="Still, it's a pain to keep going downstairs like this. I prefer my taller form.",
  ["100221501_23"]="Let me check. Good, no misspellings this time...",
  ["100221501_24"]="It's so dull being stuck in this room. Just reading all day and sorting through the pleas for help in the emails... checking, checking, checking... and occasionally dashing downstairs to lend a hand.",
  ["100221501_25"]="Hold on... have I complained many times about this before?",
  ["100221501_26"]="Pausing briefly in her writing, she stifles another yawn.",
  ["100221501_27"]="Almost at the same time, a faint yet distinct knock echoes in the room, breaking the silence.",
  ["100221501_28"]="Another yawn escapes her as she straightens her back and gazes at the door.",
  ["100221501_29"]="I'm still awake...",
  ["100221501_3"]="At the heart of the bookshelves filled with diaries, a cluttered desk holds lamps, pens, trinkets, screens, and stacks of documents, leaving just enough room for writing.",
  ["100221501_30"]="Upon receiving permission, a dark figure enters, holding a box in his hand.",
  ["100221501_31"]="While it's not my place to remind you, children under ten should get about ten to twelve hours of sleep a day, Nanna.",
  ["100221501_32"]="Ah! Wait! Spare me the lecture the moment you get back.",
  ["100221501_33"]="I'm not your kid, Cosmos. My appearance is just temporary, okay?",
  ["100221501_34"]="Regrettably, sitting with crossed arms puffed out in a raised office chair does not enhance her sense of authority.",
  ["100221501_35"]="Of course. How dare I disrespect the Mentor of Eme-an?",
  ["100221501_36"]="Before I left the tower, I entrusted all the responsibilities to your hands precisely because I believe in your abilities, Mentor.",
  ["100221501_37"]="His words fill the girl with pride, causing her to puff out her chest.",
  ["100221501_38"]="Absolutely! Nothing will go wrong under my watch!",
  ["100221501_39"]="Ahem! But the Mentor would like you to take your duties as the Head Librarian more seriously, Cosmos!",
  ["100221501_4"]="The lamp always remains illuminated at night, resembling a beacon on the sea of history, faithfully glowing each evening.",
  ["100221501_40"]="Yeah, I understand.",
  ["100221501_41"]="He nods in reply and approaches the desk, setting the box down, his gaze drifting over the open diary.",
  ["100221501_42"]="Alas, looks like our Mentor is in a bad mood?",
  ["100221501_43"]="You know, I wouldn't mind if you wanted to return to Eme-an in your current form.",
  ["100221501_44"]="Oh! Someone finally remembers to think about me.",
  ["100221501_45"]="Yeah, I'm not thrilled about being stuck in my room alone for so long!",
  ["100221501_46"]="What am I supposed to do here? Every day is just reading books and checking emails.",
  ["100221501_47"]="I want to get out... I want to go back to Eme-an...",
  ["100221501_48"]="As the final word trails off, the girl's demeanor deflates, her head lowering in contemplation.",
  ["100221501_49"]="No, no, I can't. If I go back like this, they'll treat me like... some child here! They won't respect me at all!",
  ["100221501_5"]="The pen's tip delicately glides across the paper, creating a soft rustling sound. The warm light from the lamp casts a gentle glow on the girl's face.",
  ["100221501_50"]="I'm the Mentor! The Mentor of Eme-an!",
  ["100221501_51"]="The little girl pouts as she vehemently rejects the suggestion.",
  ["100221501_52"]="By the way...",
  ["100221501_53"]="By the way?",
  ["100221501_54"]="Taking care of kids is tough. Even I might lose my cool sometimes.",
  ["100221501_55"]="Behaving well in this form isn't easy. I don't want to stir up any drama...",
  ["100221501_56"]="Maybe I should go back once I'm an adult.",
  ["100221501_57"]="In an eternal cycle of periodic changes lies the essence of Nanna's current life.",
  ["100221501_58"]="Since that ancient observation, her growth has deviated from the typical life progression.",
  ["100221501_59"]="Her physical development follows a cyclical pattern, advancing from five years old to thirty-five years old and then regressing, akin to the waxing and waning of the moon, forever trapped within the loop of time.",
  ["100221501_6"]="August 29.",
  ["100221501_60"]="Ah, forget it! I wasn't serious!",
  ["100221501_61"]="I'm already used to it, to be honest. Kids just have more energy, and their cognition isn't... hmmm... well coordinated, maybe?",
  ["100221501_62"]="Beneath the tip of her pen, she corrects all misspellings and other errors.",
  ["100221501_63"]="Setting the pen aside, she reaches out to touch the Earth-Moon model on her desk, watching as the gray celestial body slowly rotates halfway.",
  ["100221501_64"]="I just want to grow taller and do more things, but why does it have to be so hard?",
  ["100221501_65"]="A wave of weariness washes over her, prompting another yawn.",
  ["100221501_66"]="It seems her bedtime is approaching.",
  ["100221501_67"]="At that moment, the Head Librarian gently nudges the unassuming box on the desk.",
  ["100221501_68"]="Heh, it's unusual to see the Mentor of Eme-an in such trouble.",
  ["100221501_69"]="In my humble opinion, what you need now is a sweet treat and a good night's sleep.",
  ["100221501_7"]="After writing the down date, the girl at the desk lifts her pen but hesitates on what to write.",
  ["100221501_70"]="Infused with sudden energy at the mention of a \"sweet treat,\" the girl eagerly grabs the box and retrieves a slice of vanilla-flavored cake.",
  ["100221501_71"]="Why didn't you tell me earlier you were bringing a cake?",
  ["100221501_72"]="Huh? Then what did you think I had brought? An anomaly sample?",
  ["100221501_73"]="Nanna playfully sticks out her tongue, signaling the end of the conversation. Quickly, she picks up a plastic fork, lifts a piece of chiffon cake with white cream to her mouth, savoring it with a contented expression.",
  ["100221501_74"]="Vanilla cake is always the best, indeed. Ahh...",
  ["100221501_75"]="With a smile, the Head Librarian watches as the girl enjoys her cake.",
  ["100221501_76"]="After a bunch of years, and there you'll be again, with that same familiar face from my youth. That's pretty amazing, I must say!",
  ["100221501_77"]="It's like an endless cycle but somehow strikes a perfect balance.",
  ["100221501_78"]="Your ability to guide young people comes from your own experiences as a child, understanding that growing up can be a rocky journey.",
  ["100221501_79"]="That's why you're the perfect person to look after the younger ones in Eme-an, right?",
  ["100221501_8"]="I need to write down today's happenings, feelings, and thoughts...",
  ["100221501_80"]="Hearing Cosmos's question, the girl, engrossed in the cake, looks up and blinks.",
  ["100221501_81"]="Uh, yeah, exactly! Just like you said!",
  ["100221501_82"]="I'm a senior! It's only natural for me to watch over the younger ones!",
  ["100221501_83"]="She pats her chest proudly, prompting a soft chuckle from Cosmos.",
  ["100221501_84"]="Yeah, absolutely.",
  ["100221501_85"]="How about considering this like a special break exclusive to you?",
  ["100221501_86"]="Fair point, but it does sound a bit old-fashioned for you to say that...",
  ["100221501_87"]="Ouch, that hurts. I'm still a youngster who's just crossed my fifties.",
  ["100221501_88"]="...Hey!",
  ["100221501_89"]="Hah, have a good night's rest after enjoying the cake.",
  ["100221501_9"]="What should I write...?",
  ["100221501_90"]="We'll be busy again tomorrow.",
  ["100221501_91"]="Huh? Hold on... You just got back, and you have to leave the tower again?",
  ["100221501_92"]="Exactly. You'll have to help shoulder more of my responsibilities, Nanna.",
  ["100221501_93"]="...In that case, just a cake won't cut it.",
  ["100221501_94"]="No worries, I'll bring you a bigger cake next time we meet.",
  ["100221501_95"]="Cosmos chuckles, taps his cane against the floor, and heads towards the exit.",
  ["100221501_96"]="From short to tall, from young to old, a myriad of individuals enter and exit her life. As it has been, so it shall be in the future. She observes these entrances and exits, much like the moon witnessing the seasonal changes on Earth.",
  ["100221501_97"]="Setting aside these thoughts, Nanna takes up her pen to finish writing in her diary.",
  ["100222101_1"]="Blade Nightmare",
  ["100222101_10"]="Pondering this question, he proceeds towards the familiar yard.",
  ["100222101_100"]="Feel free to make your request. I've promised you, and I'll keep my word.",
  ["100222101_101"]="But just as I said... I can't bring command the sun come rise in the west, or make the river flow backwards.",
  ["100222101_102"]="Is it genuinely beyond his capacity to command the sun to rise in the west? Or reverse the river's flow? Or bestow everlasting health and life?",
  ["100222101_103"]="Yet, he recollects the master mentioning the final wish.",
  ["100222101_104"]="If the master has mentioned it, then perhaps it is not impossible.",
  ["100222101_105"]="I overheard the doctor saying Tiaohua's illness is terminal, and she won't reach adulthood.",
  ["100222101_106"]="Is there truly no cure for her illness?",
  ["100222101_107"]="The master remains quiet, serenely regarding Wushi.",
  ["100222101_108"]="Wushi promptly understands the unspoken message. Nonetheless, he respectfully bows to him once more.",
  ["100222101_109"]="You saved me that day, giving me a second chance at life, Master.",
  ["100222101_11"]="Upon pushing open the gate, the figures before him momentarily fill him with disbelief.",
  ["100222101_110"]="However, Tiaohua wasn't as fortunate. She suffered too much.",
  ["100222101_111"]="If I had your swordsmanship, I could protect her in the future...",
  ["100222101_112"]="...It's not just about her. If I could rid the world of evil, it would be a more peaceful place.",
  ["100222101_113"]="Holding the lamp, the master briefly lapses into silence.",
  ["100222101_114"]="So, once you've mastered swordsmanship, you plan to rid the world of evildoers?",
  ["100222101_115"]="You might defeat kill dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of villains... but would that end all tragedy?",
  ["100222101_116"]="...",
  ["100222101_117"]="Harming others ultimately harms yourself. Perhaps you haven't grasped this truth yet.",
  ["100222101_118"]="The master rises from his seat, drawing aside the curtain to gaze into the distance.",
  ["100222101_119"]="The Grandeur River is veiled in dense mist during the rainy season.",
  ["100222101_12"]="The boy experiences a pang of panic, uncertain how to explain his delayed return, standing frozen until his father gestures for him to snap out of it.",
  ["100222101_120"]="Despite the caretakers I've arranged, no one can replace a brother's care.",
  ["100222101_121"]="Even after being apart for so long, you're still her kind brother. Why would you want to learn swordsmanship?",
  ["100222101_122"]="Wushi maintains his silence, steadfast in his kneeling position.",
  ["100222101_123"]="The familiar bitter taste floods his mouth once more. His teeth clench as a hint of saltiness touches his tongue.",
  ["100222101_124"]="Before lifting his head, he catches a sigh from the master.",
  ["100222101_125"]="Master...",
  ["100222101_126"]="...",
  ["100222101_127"]="I won't make any promises about swordsmanship.",
  ["100222101_128"]="But if you choose to journey with me, that's entirely up to you.",
  ["100222101_129"]="I won't pry for more details or stand in your way. You do what feels right.",
  ["100222101_13"]="...You're back, just a bit late.",
  ["100222101_130"]="However, Wushi, this journey won't be easy. You need to be prepared.",
  ["100222101_131"]="Th-thank you, Master!",
  ["100222101_132"]="Upon returning to the ward, Wushi inhales deeply and attempts a smile at his reflection in the mirror.",
  ["100222101_133"]="As he enters Tiaohua's ward, Tiaohua is already asleep.",
  ["100222101_134"]="Tiaohua...",
  ["100222101_135"]="Tiaohua hasn't done anything wrong, but why did fate deal such a harsh hand on her?",
  ["100222101_136"]="He knows there must be something he can do for her.",
  ["100222101_137"]="After separated all these years, we've finally reunited... but I can't solely rely on Master's protection.",
  ["100222101_138"]="Once I've honed my skills enough to keep you safe, I'll hurry back to your side...",
  ["100222101_139"]="...I'm ready for this.",
  ["100222101_14"]="Maiden Rose, the broken bowls, and the two planks swaying in the wind, resembling the wings of a dying moth... The scene evokes a sense of deja vu, yet he cannot pinpoint the exact memory.",
  ["100222101_15"]="His father, attempting to speak but ultimately falling silent, sets down the bowl as if purposely concealing it from him.",
  ["100222101_16"]="I turned to look at my mother. Her once familiar face now appeared blurred in the confines of the narrow room.",
  ["100222101_17"]="He is well aware of the contents of the bowl and anticipates the ensuing events.",
  ["100222101_18"]="Tears brim in his eyes as he tries to stop his mother, only to receive a loving gesture as she gently wipes his face.",
  ["100222101_19"]="Don't worry. You've been doing great.",
  ["100222101_2"]="Where am I, exactly?",
  ["100222101_20"]="Go find Tiaohua. Take good care of her.",
  ["100222101_21"]="Before he can think of something to stop them, his father has already downed the entire bowl of poisonous wine.",
  ["100222101_22"]="He reclines into a slightly tilted chair, teetered on the edge of slumber.",
  ["100222101_23"]="...It's time for you to leave.",
  ["100222101_24"]="Don't look back... You don't belong to this place anymore.",
  ["100222101_25"]="Do I not belong here? But... isn't this my home? Where else could I go?",
  ["100222101_26"]="His mother has stopped caressing his head. Did she too, drink the poisonous wine while he was pondering his father's words in confusion?",
  ["100222101_27"]="Bewildered, he raises the bowl, catching a glimpse of an unfamiliar face reflected in the liquid.",
  ["100222101_28"]="What adheres to his face is not sweat, but dried blood.",
  ["100222101_29"]="Locking eyes with his reflection, a shiver runs through his body...",
  ["100222101_3"]="The road extends endlessly before him, gradually blending into twilight hues.",
  ["100222101_30"]="It appears he has committed a grave act prior to his return, evident in the beastly rage reflected in his eyes in the liquid.",
  ["100222101_31"]="The strong gust, carrying yellow sand, violently flings the door open, tearing up the wings of the \"dying moth.\"",
  ["100222101_32"]="Amidst a deafening silence, he feels engulfed by an unending sandstorm in an instant.",
  ["100222101_33"]="...",
  ["100222101_34"]="Alarmed, he stands from the chair, encountering a ward so pristine that it borders on blinding.",
  ["100222101_35"]="The rainy season has arrived. The persistent rain outside has lasted for days.",
  ["100222101_36"]="Wiping his face, Wushi is relieved to find only a light sheen of sweat on his forehead, devoid of any traces of blood.",
  ["100222101_37"]="Did you have a bad dream, brother?",
  ["100222101_38"]="His sister regards him with concern, likely the one who awakened him from the nightmare.",
  ["100222101_39"]="Clenching his fists, tingling with numbness, and shaking off the haze, he dispels the illusion of being engulfed by a sandstorm.",
  ["100222101_4"]="He stops, gazing blankly at the familiar village ahead.",
  ["100222101_40"]="Gradually, his perception of time returns to normal—it has been six months since he left the Western Region.",
  ["100222101_41"]="The final scene he witnessed has morphed into a recurring nightmare, dragging him back to the past.",
  ["100222101_42"]="Watching Tiaohua's fragile figure before him, Wushi senses a twinge of guilt in his heart.",
  ["100222101_43"]="No, it's nothing.",
  ["100222101_44"]="...",
  ["100222101_45"]="His blade lightly scrapes the pear's surface, producing a soft sound in the tranquil ward.",
  ["100222101_46"]="Upon finishing peeling the pear, he meticulously sheathes his blade.",
  ["100222101_47"]="Have a pear.",
  ["100222101_48"]="You take it, brother. I'm not hungry.",
  ["100222101_49"]="Wushi remains silent, setting the peeled pear on the nightstand.",
  ["100222101_5"]="There is no smoke or light.",
  ["100222101_50"]="Have you been facing any trouble recently, brother?",
  ["100222101_51"]="Trouble?",
  ["100222101_52"]="Taken aback, Wushi meets Tiaohua's expectant gaze, then averts his eyes with feigned composure.",
  ["100222101_53"]="How could I be troubled? I'm so happy to see you again.",
  ["100222101_54"]="You're a terrible liar.",
  ["100222101_55"]="You rarely smile or talk much... but I can tell something is bothering you.",
  ["100222101_56"]="Tiaohua reaches for the knife, intending to cut the pear in half on the plate.",
  ["100222101_57"]="Let me handle it.",
  ["100222101_58"]="If I'm right, it's about Master, right?",
  ["100222101_59"]="...",
  ["100222101_6"]="Beneath the iron-colored sky, it resembles both a vast burial ground and a mere rusted cluster etched in memories.",
  ["100222101_60"]="Yeah.",
  ["100222101_61"]="Wushi nods, extending one of the pear halves.",
  ["100222101_62"]="Tiaohua accepts the pear but does not bring it to her mouth.",
  ["100222101_63"]="Lately, every time you see Master, you get more anxious than usual. After he leaves, you start asking about my well-being.",
  ["100222101_64"]="You tend to keep things bottled up, but your emotions are written all over your face.",
  ["100222101_65"]="You want to go with Master, but you can't bear to leave me behind, right?",
  ["100222101_66"]="How could I leave you alone in this city after we've finally reunited? Especially when you're so vulnerable.",
  ["100222101_67"]="Don't worry. I won't disappear this time... Master has arranged for great care for me. You don't need to worry about me anymore, brother.",
  ["100222101_68"]="On the other hand, Master... He feels like he doesn't belong here, and I doubt he'll stay in CangLin City for long.",
  ["100222101_69"]="I have a feeling Master will leave one day without a goodbye.",
  ["100222101_7"]="A rusted memory akin to the many villages once scattered across this parched land, vanishing without a trace in the winds of drought.",
  ["100222101_70"]="So, brother... If there's something you want to do, go ahead. Don't worry about me.",
  ["100222101_71"]="I'll stay here, waiting for your return.",
  ["100222101_72"]="Okay, I'm off to meet Master. I'll be back soon.",
  ["100222101_73"]="Wushi firmly clasps his sister's hand, offering a somewhat stiff smile.",
  ["100222101_74"]="Shutting the ward door, a dull ache pricks his chest.",
  ["100222101_75"]="Tiaohua's assumption was accurate. He does plan to follow the master.",
  ["100222101_76"]="Given the master's summons, he chooses to convey his intentions directly.",
  ["100222101_77"]="Wushi, I wanted to say goodbye for now.",
  ["100222101_78"]="CangLin City is peaceful, with no worries about food or safety.",
  ["100222101_79"]="I've found a family for you on the outskirts to settle down. Learn farming and live peacefully.",
  ["100222101_8"]="His face glistens with sweat, his steps heavy as if burdened by unseen weight.",
  ["100222101_80"]="Remember, Tiaohua is delicate. Take good care of her, will you?",
  ["100222101_81"]="Wushi maintains his silence.",
  ["100222101_82"]="Hmm? What else is on your mind?",
  ["100222101_83"]="Master... I don't want to leave your side. Please let me stay with you.",
  ["100222101_84"]="Even if I can never repay your kindness, I want to stay by your side, Master.",
  ["100222101_85"]="Haha, don't say that... By the way, life on the road is tough, Wushi.",
  ["100222101_86"]="The Western Path is hard for a boy like you. I've seen how you've endured it before.",
  ["100222101_87"]="Your persistence would be better used learning skills and finding a stable job rather than following a wanderer like me.",
  ["100222101_88"]="But the skills I want to learn aren't here, Master.",
  ["100222101_89"]="Only by staying by your side might I improve my skills, Master.",
  ["100222101_9"]="He departed from this place long ago, so why does he find himself there still?",
  ["100222101_90"]="With a lamp in hand, the master ponders for a moment.",
  ["100222101_91"]="CangLin City is a blend of ancient and modern, encompassing almost everything in Qian.",
  ["100222101_92"]="But the skills you want to learn aren't here, you say?",
  ["100222101_93"]="Perhaps this place is not meant for you.",
  ["100222101_94"]="...No, it's not.",
  ["100222101_95"]="I've decided to travel with you, Master.",
  ["100222101_96"]="I don't want to become your burden. I'd appreciate if I could learn some self-defense methods from you, Master.",
  ["100222101_97"]="Proceeding without awaiting a reply, Wushi respectfully bows twice to the man before him.",
  ["100222101_98"]="When he lifts his gaze, the master merely grins, offering no response, as if peering through him.",
  ["100222101_99"]="These are just your excuses, right?",
  ["100222201_1"]="Golden Slash",
  ["100222201_10"]="But Master must have his reasons. It's not my place to question it.",
  ["100222201_2"]="Six months have elapsed since he committed to following the master.",
  ["100222201_3"]="His travels have taken him from the mountain's base to the snow-capped peak of Mount Tianque.",
  ["100222201_4"]="Various myths surround the First Emperor. Some suggest that upon finishing QingYu City, he recognized the completion of his task. Subsequently, he divested himself from worldly concerns, purportedly achieving immortality at Mount Tianque's summit.",
  ["100222201_5"]="Immortality... Sounds like wishful thinking to me.",
  ["100222201_6"]="If his work is truly finished, why does injustice still thrive in the world?",
  ["100222201_7"]="Snapping out of his reverie, Wushi finds himself gazing at the clouds, briefly captivated and almost forgetting the master's directives.",
  ["100222201_8"]="Oh, Master asked me to fetch water from a mountain spring.",
  ["100222201_9"]="I'm wonder what's so special about the spring in Mount Tianque.",
  ["100222202_1"]="The sand twirls in the sky, carrying the scent of dried blood.",
  ["100222202_10"]="Are you awake?",
  ["100222202_11"]="Master... I...",
  ["100222202_12"]="I'm really sorry for all the trouble I caused you.",
  ["100222202_13"]="Well, I wouldn't call it \"trouble.\" Without you, those residents would not have made it.",
  ["100222202_14"]="Tianli residents... Oh, yeah... how are they doing?",
  ["100222202_15"]="They got some wounds, nothing too serious. But you, on the other hand...",
  ["100222202_16"]="You're pretty beaten up, inside and out. You'll need some time to recover.",
  ["100222202_17"]="While I admire the fighting spirit of youngsters, valuing your own life is always a smart move.",
  ["100222202_18"]="Valuing life? Despite having skirted death's threshold numerous times... Is such a life genuinely worthy of value?",
  ["100222202_19"]="Regrettably, the bear managed to flee in the end. Moreover, if it weren't for the master's intervention, he would have not repelled the bear.",
  ["100222202_2"]="Once more, he find himself ensnared in the familiar nightmare.",
  ["100222202_20"]="At that moment, he realizes that he is incapable of drive off even a feral bear, let alone vanquish evil.",
  ["100222202_21"]="I was ready to give it my all. If it meant saving them even if it cost me, I'd have taken on that bear without a second thought.",
  ["100222202_22"]="But I'm just too weak...",
  ["100222202_23"]="...",
  ["100222202_24"]="Giving it your all... Well, it's crucial to understand your limits in risky situations.",
  ["100222202_25"]="As you wish, Master.",
  ["100222202_26"]="By the way, while you were unconscious, someone from the Tianli Clan swung by and left a gift for you...",
  ["100222202_27"]="The master retrieves a pair of blades from his garments, handing them to Wushi.",
  ["100222202_28"]="These blades...",
  ["100222202_29"]="What do you think?",
  ["100222202_3"]="Wushi stares blankly at the dull blades in his hand.",
  ["100222202_30"]="Wushi measures the weight in his palm.",
  ["100222202_31"]="These blades are surprisingly sharp and light. They can't be something ordinary.",
  ["100222202_32"]="Hahaha, you've got a good eye. The Tianli Clan were the pioneers in crafting metal weapons. They must be really thankful to you, hence the gift of these finely crafted blades.",
  ["100222202_33"]="I... I'm not sure if I should accept them.",
  ["100222202_34"]="My skills aren't up to par... I'm worried they'll go to waste in my hands.",
  ["100222202_35"]="I've got a question for you, Wushi.",
  ["100222202_36"]="What were you thinking when you faced that feral bear?",
  ["100222202_37"]="Upon hearing those words, Wushi struggles to recollect his thoughts from that moment but recalls nothing.",
  ["100222202_38"]="Following a brief contemplation, he responds cautiously.",
  ["100222202_39"]="I was just focused on saving those people. I didn't have much time for deep thoughts.",
  ["100222202_4"]="The previously familiar village now exists as a distant memory. A spectral figure emerges from the boundless wind, resembling both human and bear.",
  ["100222202_40"]="The master pauses momentarily before bursting into laughter.",
  ["100222202_41"]="Haha, killing to protect?... Well, that befits your age and character well.",
  ["100222202_42"]="You'll have plenty of time to think of my question in the days to come.",
  ["100222202_43"]="About your sword skills, I know this technique passed down by a friend of mine. When I learned it, I was too young and reckless to grasp its true essence, only the form.",
  ["100222202_44"]="I'm passing it on to you now. If you can master it, maybe my old friend will stop haunting my dreams.",
  ["100222202_45"]="Th-thank you, Master!",
  ["100222202_46"]="...But before that, there's something important you need to understand, Wushi.",
  ["100222202_47"]="Suddenly, his demeanor shifts to seriousness.",
  ["100222202_48"]="All I promise is offering you some swordsmanship knowledge.",
  ["100222202_49"]="But being good with a sword isn't the same as mastering the art of swordsmanship.",
  ["100222202_5"]="He flings his blades with fury, but they dissolve amidst the swirling sand like fragile petals.",
  ["100222202_50"]="Remember, all weapons are ominous. Handle them with care, or you might end up hurting yourself.",
  ["100222202_51"]="But in the end, your destiny is in your own hands.",
  ["100222202_52"]="As Wushi gazes at the twin blades in his grip, faint traces reminiscent of blood appear to seep from them.",
  ["100222202_53"]="I will remember your words, Master.",
  ["100222202_6"]="!",
  ["100222202_7"]="Upon opening his eyes, an unfamiliar ceiling meets his gaze.",
  ["100222202_8"]="As he struggles to rise, a sharp pang in his abdomen intensifies the pain throughout his body.",
  ["100222202_9"]="His wounds, meticulously bandaged, hint at a severe injury.",
  ["100222301_1"]="Bold Gambit",
  ["100222301_10"]="Bending down, the master retrieves the blades, dusting off the dirt specks.",
  ["100222301_11"]="Mastery in swordsmanship isn't something you achieve overnight.",
  ["100222301_12"]="Without the right mindset, progress can be hard to come by.",
  ["100222301_13"]="Returning the blades to Wushi, the master traces a semicircle in the air.",
  ["100222301_14"]="Dual blades, with their short reach, are best for close combat.",
  ["100222301_15"]="When you attack, you're also within range of your opponent's strikes.",
  ["100222301_16"]="What do you think is the key to mastering these moves, Wushi?",
  ["100222301_17"]="Hmm... I think it's about taking calculated risks.",
  ["100222301_18"]="Hesitating in close combat could cost you dearly.",
  ["100222301_19"]="That's a bold answer, fitting for a young one like you. Follow me, I'll show you what I mean.",
  ["100222301_2"]="Dawn emerges, casting a subtle morning light.",
  ["100222301_3"]="Bold Gambit",
  ["100222301_4"]="Uncertain whether due to his injuries or unfamiliarity with the new weapons, Wushi finds his movements awkward, and the newly acquired techniques possess an inexplicable stickiness hindering his actions.",
  ["100222301_5"]="Before completing his practice, his arms grow heavy, his steps falter.",
  ["100222301_6"]="Unexpectedly stumbling over something, the blades slip from his grasp, clattering to the ground before settling at someone's feet.",
  ["100222301_7"]="Master...?",
  ["100222301_8"]="You got up early, Wushi.",
  ["100222301_9"]="It's been a few days since I learned those new moves, but I'm struggling to grasp their essence... I thought I'd practice on my own. Sorry for the awkwardness.",
  ["100222302_1"]="Gah... Gah...",
  ["100222302_10"]="Focusing on your inner self might not seem directly related to swordsmanship, but it's foundational in martial arts.",
  ["100222302_11"]="However, it's a gradual process. Once you've got the hang of footwork and avoid rash moves, you'll start to grasp swordsmanship on a deeper level.",
  ["100222302_12"]="Your blades aren't something to be unsheathed easily, when you unsheathe it, you expose your vulnerabilities... But maybe it's a bit early to delve into that now.",
  ["100222302_13"]="The master turns away and casually tosses something to Wushi.",
  ["100222302_14"]="As your mentor, Wushi, I'll do my part to steer you in the right direction. Let's pick up our training at the same time tomorrow.",
  ["100222302_15"]="Wushi is surprised observing the medicinal cream in his hand.",
  ["100222302_16"]="Please look forward to my progress, Master.",
  ["100222302_2"]="After several repetitions, Wushi exhausts his strength, his legs giving way, nearly causing him to lurch forward to the ground.",
  ["100222302_3"]="Let's wrap it up for today. What have you learned, Wushi?",
  ["100222302_4"]="I'm not really getting it.",
  ["100222302_5"]="Upon hearing Wushi express his confusion so directly for the first time, the master's curiosity is piqued.",
  ["100222302_6"]="Oh? What's puzzling you? Tell me more.",
  ["100222302_7"]="Master, you mentioned working on footwork and mindset... but I'm struggling to see how it connects to practicing with the dummy.",
  ["100222302_8"]="And while this is supposed to help with footwork, all I've been doing is dodging the dummy's strikes...",
  ["100222302_9"]="Can you shed some light on this for me, Master?",
  ["100222401_1"]="Debating Martial Arts",
  ["100222401_10"]="The master grins.",
  ["100222401_11"]="Bloodshed isn't the only answer... If you're worried about lacking experience, let's have some discussions today. I'll lay out scenarios, and you suggest your responses. How does that sound?",
  ["100222401_12"]="Even though it's just a discussion, you might find the insights quite valuable.",
  ["100222401_13"]="Please, go ahead, Master.",
  ["100222401_2"]="With a crisp slash, the final dummy is split in two.",
  ["100222401_3"]="Wushi sheaths his blades, leaving behind only the remnants of the dummies.",
  ["100222401_4"]="Despite years of practicing swordsmanship, this marks the first time when he has destroyed all the dummies unscathed.",
  ["100222401_5"]="Your blades are sharp enough, Wushi.",
  ["100222401_6"]="Silently, the master approaches him from behind.",
  ["100222401_7"]="Thank you, Master.",
  ["100222401_8"]="While I've only practiced against dummies, I fear I might still feel lost in a real fight.",
  ["100222401_9"]="Heh? Feel lost in a real fight? Seems like you're eager for a real challenge to show your strength.",
  ["100222402_1"]="Wushi feints a few times, controlling his breath without exerting force.",
  ["100222402_10"]="Sheathing his blades, Wushi bows his head, his evident embarrassment palpable.",
  ["100222402_11"]="I ask for your forgiveness, Master.",
  ["100222402_12"]="No worries. You're an eager young warrior keen to showcase your skills, and it was all hypothetical; no harm done.",
  ["100222402_13"]="But Wushi... take my words to heart.",
  ["100222402_14"]="While apes can be mischievous, a loud shout can usually scare them off. Slicing the vines and causing a fall off the cliffs might be too extreme, don't you think?",
  ["100222402_15"]="...",
  ["100222402_16"]="Tortoises, on the other hand, are typically gentle and slow. You don't even need to harm them if you're trying to cross the river.",
  ["100222402_17"]="I'm so ashamed.",
  ["100222402_18"]="If I ever find myself in such a situation, I'll remember your guidance and only draw my blades when absolutely necessary.",
  ["100222402_19"]="I thought swordsmanship was solely about killing and that unsheathing my blades meant life or death. Swiftly ending an opponent could be seen as mercy... but I now see real situations are more complex, Master.",
  ["100222402_2"]="Swiftly, his right foot moves half a step forward, his left arm cutting through the air akin to wielding a battle axe.",
  ["100222402_20"]="Swiftly ending an opponent could be seen as mercy... It seems like you've pondered this quite a bit.",
  ["100222402_21"]="The master shakes his head.",
  ["100222402_22"]="However, it's just our discussion after all. You can't truly grasp the weight of taking a life until you've been in that situation yourself.",
  ["100222402_23"]="Maybe one day, when you're faced with that decision, you'll understand the gravity of such \"mercy.\"",
  ["100222402_24"]="Your blades can slice through flesh and bone, but they won't cleave the deeper confusions within you.",
  ["100222402_25"]="It's only when you wield those blades that you'll feel their true weight in your hands.",
  ["100222402_26"]="...",
  ["100222402_27"]="Wushi attempts to brandish his blades, only to note that his wrist lacks its former flexibility.",
  ["100222402_28"]="I'm not quite following, Master.",
  ["100222402_29"]="My blades may become more of a burden than a tool.",
  ["100222402_3"]="If it were a snake, it would have been sliced neatly in two.",
  ["100222402_30"]="Then how am I supposed to use them to forge a path?",
  ["100222402_31"]="Holding the blades, the once naive boy now possesses a gaze sharp and resolute.",
  ["100222402_32"]="Oh? Forging a path? Well said.",
  ["100222402_33"]="But who exactly are you forging this path for?",
  ["100222402_34"]="...",
  ["100222402_35"]="Upon hearing the master's words, Wushi perceives several figures. Is it for Tiaohua? Yet, he has done little for her in recent years... Perhaps he lacks reliability in her eyes as a brother.",
  ["100222402_36"]="Is it for the master? How can he pave a path for the master? Conversely, it is the master who has guided him from his immaturity in the beginning.",
  ["100222402_37"]="No rush to figure it all out, Wushi. Your journey ahead is a long and challenging one.",
  ["100222402_38"]="The master's words disrupt Wushi's contemplation.",
  ["100222402_39"]="I've got some business in QingYu City, and I need you to accompany me this time.",
  ["100222402_4"]="Your movements are fluid and flawless. Consider yourself graduated.",
  ["100222402_40"]="If you need to talk to Tiaohua, make it quick and come back promptly.",
  ["100222402_41"]="Yeah.",
  ["100222402_5"]="Thanks for your kind words, Master.",
  ["100222402_6"]="However, Wushi...",
  ["100222402_7"]="The master responds with a nonchalant smile.",
  ["100222402_8"]="I only mentioned hearing a rustle in the grass. I never said it was a snake; it might have been just a rabbit.",
  ["100222402_9"]="Drawing your blade and slicing it in half seems a bit too harsh.",
  ["100222501_1"]="Safeguarding Life",
  ["100222501_10"]="Don't worry about me, Master. I'll go along with whatever you decide.",
  ["100222501_11"]="The master pauses, visibly surprised by Wushi's response.",
  ["100222501_12"]="But you do need to return to CangLin City soon, right? Especially since Tiaohua asked you to come back quickly.",
  ["100222501_13"]="Tiaohua will understand if it's for your sake, Master.",
  ["100222501_14"]="Well then... *Sigh* Let's stay here for a while.",
  ["100222501_15"]="Wushi is puzzled by the master's prolonged sigh.",
  ["100222501_16"]="Upon seating themselves, a man dressed in traditional Tianli attire approaches, presenting them with a menu.",
  ["100222501_17"]="Welcome to Tianli Guest House, esteemed guests. Are you here for a meal or staying the night?",
  ["100222501_18"]="If you get a sightseeing kit here, you can also get a discount on our traditional crafts...",
  ["100222501_19"]="Their eyes meet unexpectedly as the man raises his head, locking gazes with Wushi.",
  ["100222501_2"]="It's surprising how much this city has changed in just a few years.",
  ["100222501_20"]="Hey, you look familiar! Have we met before?",
  ["100222501_21"]="Hmm, I don't think so.",
  ["100222501_22"]="The master accepts the menu and studies the man briefly.",
  ["100222501_23"]="How's the wound from the bear attack, my friend?",
  ["100222501_24"]="...",
  ["100222501_25"]="Ah! Now I remember why you look familiar!",
  ["100222501_26"]="Aren't you the hero who saved us from the bear a few years ago?!",
  ["100222501_27"]="Please, come inside! We've been wanting to thank you for saving us!",
  ["100222501_28"]="Inside Tianli Guest House.",
  ["100222501_29"]="So, that bear is still causing trouble now?",
  ["100222501_3"]="The Tianli clan opening a guest house is quite unexpected... Hmm, quite a departure from their usual ways.",
  ["100222501_30"]="Yeah... Unfortunately, the bear resurfaced after a while. It had an old wound on its neck, so it must be the same bear you fought off.",
  ["100222501_31"]="...",
  ["100222501_32"]="That bear used to target humans but got chased away before. Now, it's back in full force seeking revenge.",
  ["100222501_33"]="Hasn't the Bureau of Civil Security taken action?",
  ["100222501_34"]="They have, but it's hard to track every corner of this mountain. Despite multiple attempts, that crafty bear always manages to slip away at the last moment and then attacks our livestock.",
  ["100222501_35"]="So, we had to seal off the back of the mountain, leaving that beast to cause havoc as it pleases.",
  ["100222501_36"]="If only I had finished it off back then...",
  ["100222501_37"]="Don't dwell on it. That bear has turned so aggressive possibly due to its old injuries. Even if it's left unchecked, its time is limited, maybe just a few more years.",
  ["100222501_38"]="Wushi remains silent, pouring half a cup of tea without drinking.",
  ["100222501_39"]="...",
  ["100222501_4"]="The master stands outside the ancestral mansion of the Tianli Clan, examining a small plaque inscribed with \"Tianli Guest House\" with keen interest.",
  ["100222501_40"]="The master takes the cup from in front of Wushi, empties it, and replaces the contents with warm wine.",
  ["100222501_41"]="Master?",
  ["100222501_42"]="What soothes my fretful soul? Vintage wine makes the wounded whole.",
  ["100222501_43"]="Whether you want to use this wine to lift your spirits for the moonlight, or to bolster your courage for the impending hunt, it's your choice.",
  ["100222501_44"]="...",
  ["100222501_45"]="Thank you, Master.",
  ["100222501_46"]="This time, I'll eradicate it once and for all.",
  ["100222501_5"]="I wonder how that stubborn fellow would react if he saw it? Angry? Maybe just speechless in shock, I reckon.",
  ["100222501_6"]="Who are you talking about, Master?",
  ["100222501_7"]="Well... just an old friend of mine.",
  ["100222501_8"]="I had planned to head straight to the peak of Mount Tianque, but stumbling upon a Tianli guest house is a pleasant surprise.",
  ["100222501_9"]="With the lovely autumn weather and the chance to taste Tianli's aged wine, it would be a shame to miss out. What do you think, Wushi?",
  ["100222502_1"]="Cutting, slashing, piercing.",
  ["100222502_10"]="A profound satisfaction envelops him, as if his burdens have been lifted.",
  ["100222502_100"]="Hah, you don't need my permission for that. It's only natural for a brother to look after his sister.",
  ["100222502_101"]="Oh, and take this little one with you as well.",
  ["100222502_102"]="There's also something that only you can take care of.",
  ["100222502_103"]="What's on your mind, Master?",
  ["100222502_104"]="Give this little one a name... Raising a bear cub is no small task.",
  ["100222502_105"]="In the days to come, you'll handle many things on your own.",
  ["100222502_11"]="He has accomplished his objective.",
  ["100222502_12"]="Sensing its impending end, the bear defiantly turns towards him, lacerating its wounds as it prepares for its final pounce.",
  ["100222502_13"]="Before its massive body hits the ground, the beast, in its death throes, displays a level of ferocity that surprises him.",
  ["100222502_14"]="!",
  ["100222502_15"]="Unable to dodge, Wushi barely manages to deflect the last blow but finds himself pinned down by the bear.",
  ["100222502_16"]="After convulsing a few times, the bear finally collapses and lies motionless.",
  ["100222502_17"]="Tsk... I slipped up at the last moment.",
  ["100222502_18"]="Master would definitely scold me if he saw this.",
  ["100222502_19"]="Now, I need to figure out how to escape from under this bear's body...",
  ["100222502_2"]="The giant bear's instinctive attacks only expose more vulnerabilities, while Wushi's strikes target its vital points effectively.",
  ["100222502_20"]="He struggles to push the lifeless beast away, only to find his attempts futile.",
  ["100222502_21"]="I must have exerted too much energy just now. Didn't expect to end up in this mess.",
  ["100222502_22"]="Looks like I'll need a short break for now.",
  ["100222502_23"]="Reclining on the ground, covered in bear carcass, he maintains a somewhat ridiculous posture when he hears a rustling from the grass behind him.",
  ["100222502_24"]="Upon looking back, he spots two glinting eyes in the grass—another beast's eyes.",
  ["100222502_25"]="...",
  ["100222502_26"]="His blades lie a few feet away, out of reach no matter how much he strains.",
  ["100222502_27"]="As the glinting eyes draw nearer, he feels a sensation as if his throat is suffocated.",
  ["100222502_28"]="Not stemming from fear, but rather an inexplicable sense of emptiness.",
  ["100222502_29"]="Never thought I'd meet my end like this...",
  ["100222502_3"]="The intense pain drives the bear into a frenzied state, offering Wushi more opportunities for aggressive attacks.",
  ["100222502_30"]="I always talked about learning swordsmanship to fight evil, but it was all just talk.",
  ["100222502_31"]="Tiaohua... I should have spent more time with her. If she finds out I'm gone, it'll break her heart.",
  ["100222502_32"]="*Sigh* Why didn't I care about her feelings earlier?",
  ["100222502_33"]="But it's too late to regret now.",
  ["100222502_34"]="...",
  ["100222502_35"]="...He should be back any minute.",
  ["100222502_36"]="Footsteps draw closer from a distance.",
  ["100222502_37"]="Looks like our fearless bear hunter has returned.",
  ["100222502_38"]="But this... Well, you look a bit messed-up, Wushi.",
  ["100222502_39"]="The wine's gone cold. Such a waste of good wine. Seems like you're still working on perfecting your skills.",
  ["100222502_4"]="The frenzied bear, swinging its paws aimlessly, exhibits no intention to flee.",
  ["100222502_40"]="Wushi remains silent, but a cub emerges from under his clothes.",
  ["100222502_41"]="A chubby bear cub.",
  ["100222502_42"]="Oh? A bear cub? So, that fierce bear was actually a mother.",
  ["100222502_43"]="Yeah. After I dealt with the bear, I couldn't bear to leave this cub behind, so I brought it back.",
  ["100222502_44"]="Haha, you said you'd eradicate it once and for all, but seems like you've left a loose end.",
  ["100222502_45"]="Please forgive my indecision, Master.",
  ["100222502_46"]="The bear cub springs from Wushi's arms, only to be lifted by the master. Emitting a couple of soft whimpers, it scurries back to Wushi's side.",
  ["100222502_47"]="No worries. I told you to make your own choices, so I won't question your decisions.",
  ["100222502_48"]="It's just not like your usual style.",
  ["100222502_49"]="You must have encountered something interesting on your journey.",
  ["100222502_5"]="Let's not waste any time.",
  ["100222502_50"]="It's actually not that interesting... I knew you'd figure it out, Master.",
  ["100222502_51"]="Convinced of his impending demise, Wushi shuts his eyes.",
  ["100222502_52"]="Instead of anticipated attacks, he feels a warm, gentle lick on his cheek. Glancing sideways, he finds the \"beast\" is actually a bear cub.",
  ["100222502_53"]="Is it his scent that led the cub to mistake him for its mother?",
  ["100222502_54"]="Seeing no reaction from Wushi, the bear cub curls up at his side and lies down quietly.",
  ["100222502_55"]="...",
  ["100222502_56"]="Harming others ultimately harms yourself. Perhaps you haven't grasped this truth yet.",
  ["100222502_57"]="Your blades can slice through flesh and bone, but they won't cleave the deeper confusions within you.",
  ["100222502_58"]="If Master hadn't taken me in that day, where would I be now?",
  ["100222502_59"]="Maybe I would have met my end a long time ago? Or worse, turned into a bandit, clueless about my fate.",
  ["100222502_6"]="Evading the bear's swipe, Wushi leaps up, precisely driving his blades into the bear's old wounds.",
  ["100222502_60"]="A cub wouldn't survive long alone in these mountains.",
  ["100222502_61"]="Gathering his strength, Wushi endeavors to free himself from the bear carcass. As he scans the surroundings, he becomes momentarily disoriented.",
  ["100222502_62"]="Master taught me how to navigate by the stars. Even in the wild, I can find my way...",
  ["100222502_63"]="...",
  ["100222502_64"]="As he lifts his eyes, the vast expanse of stars greets him. The canopy looms beyond reach, while a solitary firefly flies across the stream's edge.",
  ["100222502_65"]="Engrossed in this ethereal beauty, he extends his hand, cradling a firefly in his palm. Gently releasing it, the light dances skyward.",
  ["100222502_66"]="The endless sand in his soul finally disperses, his mind clearer than ever before.",
  ["100222502_67"]="It's time to sheathe my blades.",
  ["100222502_68"]="Someone is waiting for me.",
  ["100222502_69"]="Thinking of that, he lies down again, accompanied by the bear cub, gazing at the starlit sky amidst the chorus of cicadas.",
  ["100222502_7"]="With all his weight on the blades, the sharp edges puncture the beast's artery accurately, causing blood to spurt out like a fountain.",
  ["100222502_70"]="Years ago, you asked me a question, Master. You wanted to know what I was thinking when I faced that feral bear.",
  ["100222502_71"]="Why bring this up now after all this time?",
  ["100222502_72"]="Your words stuck with me, Master. You said I was killing to protect.",
  ["100222502_73"]="That's what I've believed too.",
  ["100222502_74"]="Believing he wielded his blades to protect his sister.",
  ["100222502_75"]="Believing he confronted that bear to rescue the Tianli people.",
  ["100222502_76"]="Until I was faced with life or death once more.",
  ["100222502_77"]="To kill or be killed. That was all I could think about then.",
  ["100222502_78"]="I killed to survive... to avoid being killed. That's why nothing else crossed my mind.",
  ["100222502_79"]="A smile graces the master's face.",
  ["100222502_8"]="The outcome is certain. No creature can survive such fatal wounds.",
  ["100222502_80"]="Yeah, just that simple and straightforward, isn't it?",
  ["100222502_81"]="Wushi nods in agreement.",
  ["100222502_82"]="Despite the nobility of wielding a sword, in the face of life and death, it narrows down to the raw essence of two lives entwined in a fight.",
  ["100222502_83"]="Survival dictates an ultimatum: kill or be killed.",
  ["100222502_84"]="A universal truth: those who kill may face the same fate one day.",
  ["100222502_85"]="There's a saying, \"To kill is to protect. What we sever are not lives, but their sins.\" While it holds true at times, it can also be a trap of using violence to combat violence.",
  ["100222502_86"]="When you choose to claim a life, you stop its capacity for evil. But you also inherit its karma, becoming part of its ongoing existence.",
  ["100222502_87"]="Blades are made for killing, no matter how we justify their use.",
  ["100222502_88"]="Keep questioning yourself, Wushi. Always ask why you wield your blades and why you take lives.",
  ["100222502_89"]="I once asked you about these blades, and you said, \"These blades are surprisingly sharp and light.\"",
  ["100222502_9"]="As he withdraws the blades from the bear's body, the edges slice through flesh, evoking a sensation akin to extracting aged swords from the earth.",
  ["100222502_90"]="Are they still as light now?",
  ["100222502_91"]="Wushi shakes his head.",
  ["100222502_92"]="That's the answer.",
  ["100222502_93"]="Remember the weight you feel now. As you improve, your swordsmanship will get better, but the weight you carry will grow heavier.",
  ["100222502_94"]="The bear cub appears to have familiarized itself with the master and approaches him.",
  ["100222502_95"]="The master chuckles, playfully petting the bear cub.",
  ["100222502_96"]="Well, just like this naughty cub.",
  ["100222502_97"]="Wushi places the bear cub back in his arms.",
  ["100222502_98"]="I have a request, Master.",
  ["100222502_99"]="I'm thinking of heading back to CangLin City to check on Tiaohua. It's been a while since we last saw each other, and I want to make sure she's doing okay.",
  ["100225301_1"]="Over recent days, I have been accompanying Qing in her calligraphy practice and training with the dummy after her work hours.",
  ["100225301_10"]="I think I need to learn to take it easy and dedicate more time to those who matter to me.",
  ["100225301_11"]="Saying this, Qing takes out a rectangular gift box and hands it to me.",
  ["100225301_12"]="Here's a little something I've prepared for you, Head Librarian. I hope you like it.",
  ["100225301_13"]="As I open the box, I notice a scroll with two prominent words \"Sheathed Edge.\"",
  ["100225301_14"]="The calligraphic strokes are elegantly displayed, a fluid dance of ink and intention on the page.",
  ["100225301_15"]="It truly is remarkable penmanship.",
  ["100225301_16"]="Thank you.",
  ["100225301_17"]="I really appreciate it.",
  ["100225301_2"]="Soon, a new calligraphy contest is on the horizon, and we agree to meet at the square where I will witness Qing's latest artwork.",
  ["100225301_3"]="Amid a crowd of spectators, Qing and other calligraphers unveil their brushes, each creating their masterpiece on the ground.",
  ["100225301_4"]="Glistening water marks are left on the ground, clearly indicating the winner.",
  ["100225301_5"]="Congratulations, Secretary Qing. Your calligraphy skills have reached new heights.",
  ["100225301_6"]="I owe it all to you. Without your guidance, I wouldn't have progressed so quickly.",
  ["100225301_7"]="With that said, Qing turns her gaze towards me.",
  ["100225301_8"]="And to you, too, Head Librarian. Thank you for your support during these days.",
  ["100225301_9"]="Taking time for hobbies like this feels rewarding and helps me relax.",
  ["100229101_1"]="Are you in the same situation as me, losing your memory and forgetting who you are and where you belong?",
  ["100229101_11"]="Upon regaining consciousness, she is immediately aware of a splitting headache.",
  ["100229101_12"]="Ugh... Whoa...",
  ["100229101_13"]="The light flickers, casting shifting shadows in the dimly lit room.",
  ["100229101_14"]="The musty scent and stale air suggest that she is now in a secluded chamber.",
  ["100229101_15"]="Surveying her unfamiliar surroundings, she finds no recollection of why she is there, except for one detail...",
  ["100229101_16"]="I'm a <color=#FEC66B>puppetmaster</color>... I must find...",
  ["100229101_17"]="What exactly is she seeking?",
  ["100229101_18"]="I'm a <color=#FEC66B>puppetmaster</color>... I must fix...",
  ["100229101_19"]="To fix a \"being\" that holds significance to her.",
  ["100229101_2"]="No need to fret. Please, let me... share a story with you.",
  ["100229101_20"]="Despite her blurred vision, the faint light sparks hope within her, enabling her to rise to her feet.",
  ["100229101_21"]="\"Once I find and fix that being, everything will fall into place.\"",
  ["100229101_22"]="Shattered Dreams",
  ["100229101_3"]="Once upon a time, there was a kingdom known as \"Daxun,\" where a spiritual tree grew at the heart of the kingdom, emerging from the earth itself.",
  ["100229101_4"]="As the tree flourished, so did the kingdom, thriving under its canopy.",
  ["100229101_5"]="However, one autumn, the tree inexplicably withered. Shortly after, the king of Daxun passed away, plunging the kingdom into turmoil.",
  ["100229101_6"]="In that moment of crisis, the revered guardian of the sacred tree proclaimed, \"This kingdom and the spiritual tree share a common origin. If someone can wield this sword and save this kingdom from its plight, the tree will regain its vitality.\"",
  ["100229101_7"]="It was then that a girl stepped forward.",
  ["100229101_8"]="Taking up the sword and embracing the task of saving the kingdom, she journeyed alongside the tree guardian, quelling revolts, banishing evil entities, and traversing half the kingdom.",
  ["100229101_9"]="Although true peace still eluded the land, she harbored an unwavering belief that one day, she would revitalize this collapsing kingdom...",
  ["100229102_1"]="The female puppet slumps against the wall, devoid of vitality.",
  ["100229102_10"]="Did I... pass out again?",
  ["100229102_11"]="I'm sorry. I really came here to fix you, but not only I lost my memories, you ended up taking care of me instead...",
  ["100229102_12"]="Healers often struggle to heal themselves.",
  ["100229102_13"]="You've come a long way, think nothing but the repair, and faint from exhaustion... No need to feel guilty.",
  ["100229102_14"]="I'll always be by your side... Tell me everything you've remembered.",
  ["100229102_15"]="Yuli sits on the ground and begins to recount, the puppet listening attentively.",
  ["100229102_16"]="Only after she finishes telling the whole story does the puppet gently lean in, embracing her tenderly.",
  ["100229102_17"]="You must have been scared coming here, right, my dear girl?",
  ["100229102_18"]="Yuli simply shakes her head in silence.",
  ["100229102_19"]="To be honest... I don't know what \"scared\" feels like.",
  ["100229102_2"]="Yuli crouches down and methodically organizes the gathered materials. As her strings flutter, gears and wooden parts fit snugly into the puppet's joints.",
  ["100229102_20"]="I only remember my name and being a puppetmaster.",
  ["100229102_21"]="That's all you need to focus on for now. Memories tied to emotions are not important and can come back to you easily.",
  ["100229102_22"]="Still, it might not be the best idea to be so detached like you are at the moment.",
  ["100229102_23"]="Next, let's head to WeiShi.",
  ["100229102_24"]="Wei... Shi?",
  ["100229102_25"]="Although the term sounds unfamiliar, as it escapes her lips, it stirs some ripples in her memories.",
  ["100229102_26"]="It's an organization that delves into the mysteries of the heaven and earth to protect the people ... and you were a part of it.",
  ["100229102_27"]="Head over there. They'll lend you a hand.",
  ["100229102_28"]="Sure, if you say so.",
  ["100229102_3"]="With the final piece snapped into place, the once-dormant puppet trembles slightly.",
  ["100229102_4"]="Yuli reaches out to brush away the shattered hair on the puppet's forehead, only to reveal a rigid, pallid face.",
  ["100229102_5"]="What are these symbols?",
  ["100229102_6"]="Unlike her memories of Sue, the puppet in front of her seems younger and more sorrowful, almost like a reflection of herself in a cold mirror.",
  ["100229102_7"]="Her thoughts are abruptly interrupted at that moment.",
  ["100229102_8"]="You're awake.",
  ["100229102_9"]="When she regains consciousness, she finds herself already lying in the puppet's embrace.",
  ["100229201_1"]="As dusk embraced, attire thickened for the chill.",
  ["100229201_10"]="But those WeiShi people won't let me take you out on the streets...",
  ["100229201_100"]="Anyway, I'd rather spend my time catching plays at the opera theater than worrying about things that don't really matter.",
  ["100229201_101"]="Recalling something, Gu Tu retrieved a puppet from her case, the same one Yuli had seen at the show.",
  ["100229201_102"]="About our last show we performed, I heard about it from the troupe and made a few tweaks of my own... Too bad you only caught the ending.",
  ["100229201_103"]="With Gu Tu's pulls, the puppet began dancing once more.",
  ["100229201_104"]="The story is about a lady in the palace who saw the bright moon and believed the moon palace must be full of blooming flowers and joy.",
  ["100229201_105"]="So, she stole the elixir of immortality and flew up there alone, only to find the palace empty except for a jade rabbit...",
  ["100229201_106"]="But by then, it was too late. From then on, she could only hold the rabbit, weeping quietly, wondering why she ever thought the moon palace would be so beautiful...",
  ["100229201_107"]="As Gu Tu shook the thread, the rabbit-shaped puppet fell into Yuli's palm.",
  ["100229201_108"]="Hey, cheer up, Yuli.",
  ["100229201_109"]="Here, take this puppet as a little souvenir for our meeting.",
  ["100229201_11"]="Naturally. Weishi has its own laws. Their duty is to protect the people from disturbances caused by things beyond this world. For a creature like me—neither human nor object—it's best I stay off the stage.",
  ["100229201_110"]="But... I can't accept this.",
  ["100229201_111"]="You said you need this for a living... I can't take something so important from you.",
  ["100229201_112"]="Don't worry, I can craft another puppet like this anytime.",
  ["100229201_113"]="This isn't just a gift. It's also a reminder.",
  ["100229201_114"]="Gu Tu playfully winked at Yuli.",
  ["100229201_115"]="You don't have to dig up your memories, if you ask me.",
  ["100229201_116"]="Your past might not be as wonderful as you believe, you know?",
  ["100229201_117"]="But it's just a show, nothing more...",
  ["100229201_118"]="Oh, really? Just a show, nothing more?",
  ["100229201_119"]="Gu Tu chuckled softly as she gently tugged Yuli's hand, leading her towards the top of the pavilion. The buildings across QingYu City shone in the moonlight, with hints of elusive fragrance drifting by, creating an ethereal atmosphere in the perpetual night.",
  ["100229201_12"]="Stop putting yourself down like that, Sue. You're not a monster.",
  ["100229201_120"]="You know, Yuli... We can start a puppet troupe together.",
  ["100229201_121"]="A puppet troupe?",
  ["100229201_122"]="Yuli glanced to Gu Tu, who seemed unfocused, as if gazing at nonexistent palaces and pavilions in the night sky.",
  ["100229201_123"]="I've wanted to share a story for a long time, but I can't perform it alone.",
  ["100229201_124"]="What's the story about?",
  ["100229201_125"]="Well... it's about a kingdom called \"Daxun,\" where a spiritual tree grew at the heart of the kingdom, blooming from the earth itself.",
  ["100229201_126"]="The fate of the kingdom was tied to this tree. As the tree thrived, so did the kingdom.",
  ["100229201_127"]="However... all good things must come to an end. One autumn, the tree inexplicably withered. Shortly after, the king of Daxun passed away, plunging the kingdom into turmoil.",
  ["100229201_128"]="So, the kingdom fell into chaos and the sacred tree withered. In that moment of crisis, the revered guardian of the sacred tree proclaimed, \"This kingdom and the spiritual tree share the common origin. If someone can wield this sword and save this kingdom from its plight, the tree will regain its vitality.\"",
  ["100229201_129"]="Did anyone step up?",
  ["100229201_13"]="Okay, okay, just kidding. Looks like I won't make it to the festival with you, so go enjoy yourself without me.",
  ["100229201_130"]="Yes, many tried, but none succeeded in saving the kingdom.",
  ["100229201_131"]="And this time, we're talking about one of those heroes, a young girl.",
  ["100229201_132"]="Taking up the sword and embracing the task of saving the kingdom, she journeyed alongside the tree guardian, quelling revolts, banishing evil entities, and traversing half the kingdom.",
  ["100229201_133"]="Evil entities... what exactly were they?",
  ["100229201_134"]="Let me think how to explain it...",
  ["100229201_135"]="Picture an enormous mechanical dragon crafted from brass, a city of machines rising from the ground driven by myriads of gears, and a giant paper kite soaring through the air... Sounds pretty wicked, right?",
  ["100229201_136"]="Did that girl really take down all those foes?",
  ["100229201_137"]="She did. She was tough, and so was the guardian by her side.",
  ["100229201_138"]="Although true peace still eluded the land, she harbored an unwavering belief that one day, she would revitalize this collapsing kingdom...",
  ["100229201_139"]="What happened after that?",
  ["100229201_14"]="But with the crowds at the lantern show, promise me that every two hours...",
  ["100229201_140"]="Well... I can't spill all the beans right now!",
  ["100229201_141"]="Gu Tu revealed a sly smile.",
  ["100229201_142"]="For us puppeteers, stories are our livelihood, not something we give away easily.",
  ["100229201_143"]="I won't spill the ending unless I find a great partner and perform the show on an auspicious day!",
  ["100229201_144"]="Oh, come on...!",
  ["100229201_145"]="Want to hear more? Drop by in the next few days, and I'll tell you how it all ends at the end of the festival!",
  ["100229201_146"]="Sure, it's a...",
  ["100229201_147"]="Before she could utter the word \"deal,\" a solemn bell tone resonated from a distance, abruptly dispelling the warm reverie with a chilling undertone.",
  ["100229201_148"]="The bell just rang... Two hours have almost passed.",
  ["100229201_149"]="I'm sorry, Gu Tu... I've got to leave.",
  ["100229201_15"]="Every two hours?",
  ["100229201_150"]="Hold on... where are you off to?",
  ["100229201_151"]="I see... It's Sue, right?",
  ["100229201_152"]="Yeah, but I'll be back!",
  ["100229201_153"]="I'll be coming to enjoy your puppet show tomorrow and the day after!",
  ["100229201_154"]="Autumntide Festival",
  ["100229201_16"]="Yeah, come back every two hours to let me know you're all good. Deal?",
  ["100229201_17"]="Sure, if you say so.",
  ["100229201_18"]="Here, tie this around your wrist...",
  ["100229201_19"]="Sue took out a piece of string, looping it around Yuli's wrist twice before tying an elegant knot.",
  ["100229201_2"]="From the pavilion's viewpoint, QingYu City was adorned with lanterns, emanating the festive spirit of the Autumntide Festival.",
  ["100229201_20"]="Yuli, the bond between a puppetmaster and their puppet is unbreakable. Remember your promise.",
  ["100229201_21"]="If you ever face something too tough, just untie this knot... and I'll be there in a flash.",
  ["100229201_22"]="The moon cast a serene glow over the crowd in QingYu City.",
  ["100229201_23"]="QingYu City shone brightly that night, and the shadow accompanying Yuli grew heavier, resembling her puppet in the eyes of the solitary girl wandering the lantern-lit market.",
  ["100229201_24"]="Walking among the crowd, Yuli felt as aimless as a falling leaf, unsure of where to go as she gazed at the myriad brightly lit lanterns.",
  ["100229201_25"]="Check out those lanterns, Su...",
  ["100229201_26"]="At that moment, she realized that Sue was not by her side.",
  ["100229201_27"]="Leaving Sue behind, she joined the crowd at the lantern fair to soak in the festive atmosphere, but only to feel a touch of loneliness due to the absence of family or friends to share her thoughts.",
  ["100229201_28"]="They say the Autumntide Festival is all about reunions, but who am I reuniting with?",
  ["100229201_29"]="Maybe... I just don't belong here.",
  ["100229201_3"]="Yuli leaned on the fence, her puppet beside her, delicately combing her long, black hair with an exquisite comb.",
  ["100229201_30"]="It's too early to head back, but I've got nothing better to do. I should head back soon so Sue doesn't fret.",
  ["100229201_31"]="With a soft sigh, Yuli turned to leave when she felt a tug at her coat.",
  ["100229201_32"]="These are...?",
  ["100229201_33"]="It was a tiny puppet.",
  ["100229201_34"]="Tracing the string amidst the bustling stall, Yuli spotted a girl of her age, radiant with a pretty face and exquisite short hair.",
  ["100229201_35"]="Please, hold on a second!",
  ["100229201_36"]="Looks like my little puppet has taken a liking to you. Since fate brought us together, could you help me finish this puppet show?",
  ["100229201_37"]="Me...? What do you need me to do?",
  ["100229201_38"]="Just hold out your hand and raise this little one up.",
  ["100229201_39"]="Thank you for all your support! Now, please enjoy the final act put on by puppeteer Gu Tu and our mysterious guest!",
  ["100229201_4"]="Despite the captivating scene, sorrow filled the girl.",
  ["100229201_40"]="Feeling a tingling sensation in her fingertips, Yuli involuntarily tossed the puppet in her palm into the air.",
  ["100229201_41"]="The small puppet spun and danced skyward, executing several rotations before landing securely in her other hand.",
  ["100229201_42"]="Accompanied by a clicking sound, the puppet in her hand transformed into a jade rabbit preparing herb medicine.",
  ["100229201_43"]="Amid gasps of amazement, the young girl named Gu Tu swiftly approached Yuli and raised her hands, signaling the end of the show.",
  ["100229201_44"]="That's a wrap for today. If you had a good time, feel free to tip. I'll be back here tomorrow at the same time. See you then!",
  ["100229201_45"]="I...",
  ["100229201_46"]="Thanks for helping out with the show. Once I've got my earnings, let's grab a bite at the lantern fair. Hang tight here for a bit, alright?",
  ["100229201_47"]="Gu Tu playfully winked at Yuli and headed towards the applauding crowd to collect tips.",
  ["100229201_48"]="Ah, she's gone...",
  ["100229201_49"]="So, her name's Gu Tu... She said she's a puppeteer, and her style seems familiar to mine... but not quite the same.",
  ["100229201_5"]="Still troubled by your memory loss, Yuli?",
  ["100229201_50"]="Considering this, Yuli involuntarily glanced towards the puppets on Gu Tu's stall, extending her hand.",
  ["100229201_51"]="Surprisingly, the knots encircling the puppets and the way the strings were fastened bore a striking resemblance to her usual techniques. By the time she snapped out of the trance, the puppets were already dancing in response to her pulls.",
  ["100229201_52"]="At that moment, a cry of surprise echoed from behind her.",
  ["100229201_53"]="Hey, hey! Hands off my puppets! I need them for my livelihood!",
  ["100229201_54"]="I went to great lengths to get this booth at the lantern fair. If you wreck my puppets, I'll be in deep trouble...",
  ["100229201_55"]="I... I'm sorry.",
  ["100229201_56"]="Alright, it's fine. You seem clueless, so I guess you were just curious... I'll let it slide.",
  ["100229201_57"]="Are you a... puppetmaster too?",
  ["100229201_58"]="Puppetmaster? Whoa, that sounds too fancy for me.",
  ["100229201_59"]="Like I said during the show, I'm just a traveling puppeteer making a living from puppet shows... What about you? Wanna share a bit about yourself?",
  ["100229201_6"]="Yeah... I've stayed here for some time, but my memories haven't improved. I worry...",
  ["100229201_60"]="I'm Yuli.",
  ["100229201_61"]="And...? That's all?",
  ["100229201_62"]="What else do you want to know?",
  ["100229201_63"]="Heehee, I saw how you handled those puppets earlier. Just be straight with me.",
  ["100229201_64"]="Gu Tu gave Yuli a mysterious smile and grasped her cuffs.",
  ["100229201_65"]="Even though I'm just a street performer, I've got a good eye for this stuff. Those finger movements, and the way you instinctively keep your right side clear—all signs of puppet work, right?",
  ["100229201_66"]="...",
  ["100229201_67"]="Yuli looked at Gu Tu, uncertain how to explain her situation, as \"memory loss\" felt like a poor excuse.",
  ["100229201_68"]="But apart from her innate puppetry skills, she remembered nothing about herself.",
  ["100229201_69"]="And what about you, Gu Tu? Did you invite me because you figured out I'm a puppetmaster?",
  ["100229201_7"]="Before Yuli finished her words, Sue gently took her hand, offering solace.",
  ["100229201_70"]="Um....",
  ["100229201_71"]="Actually, I didn't realize that when I had my little puppet pull you onto the stage.",
  ["100229201_72"]="You seemed so lost in the crowd, like a young lady from a wealthy family who had wandered off at a festival.",
  ["100229201_73"]="So I thought it might be fun to invite you up there... Maybe I could even earn a bit more if I entertained you well, right?",
  ["100229201_74"]="...",
  ["100229201_75"]="Sue said those who use puppets to deceive others... are terribly bad.",
  ["100229201_76"]="H-hey, don't give me that look! I'm not some shady scammer! I just wanted to add some excitement to my show!",
  ["100229201_77"]="Anyway, thanks to you, I've made a decent amount of money today. How about we grab a drink and chat? My treat.",
  ["100229201_78"]="I'm curious to hear more about this... puppetmaster you mentioned.",
  ["100229201_79"]="Hold on... you've lost your memories?",
  ["100229201_8"]="Balance is key, Yuli. Put those worries aside and enjoy your time in the city today.",
  ["100229201_80"]="Gu Tu exclaimed in a hushed tone while absentmindedly picking at pastries in her bowl, seemingly refining her puppetry skills.",
  ["100229201_81"]="Yeah... I can't remember anything except my name and that I'm a puppetmaster...",
  ["100229201_82"]="But luckily, Sue is on my side. She taught me everything from weaving, getting along with people... and even understanding myself. With her around, I feel like I can slowly recall who I really am.",
  ["100229201_83"]="Hey, hey... are you sure you're not some highborn lady from a prestigious family? Even your puppet is so intricate.",
  ["100229201_84"]="A prestigious family?",
  ["100229201_85"]="Gu Tu finished the last bit of the pastry in the bowl before turning her gaze to Yuli.",
  ["100229201_86"]="Yeah, for us street performers, we usually have basic string puppets. You pull the strings, they move, but they're still just lifeless toys no matter what you do.",
  ["100229201_87"]="But those exceptional puppets are on a whole other level. They're incredibly intricate, almost lifelike. They even seem to have emotions and thoughts of their own.",
  ["100229201_88"]="Of course, the more intricate the puppet, the more demanding it is to craft. Without three to five decades of effort, it's impossible to capture such lifelike spirit. That's why only noble clans with centuries of legacy can afford these puppets.",
  ["100229201_89"]="Speaking of which... Sue, your puppet, she must have been around long before you, right? Maybe she's had other masters before you.",
  ["100229201_9"]="The Autumntide Festival is here, with the streets all lit up. If you miss this moment, you'll have to wait another year.",
  ["100229201_90"]="It sounds like you're really curious about Sue. How about you come meet her with me?",
  ["100229201_91"]="Gu Tu...?",
  ["100229201_92"]="A glint of intense emotion flashed in Gu Tu's eyes.",
  ["100229201_93"]="It seemed like surprise, joy, or fury... but Yuli couldn't quite discern it.",
  ["100229201_94"]="But in the next moment, Gu Tu resumed her usual smile.",
  ["100229201_95"]="Thank you for the offer, Yuli... but I'll pass.",
  ["100229201_96"]="I'm just a small-time puppeteer, making a living with my modest creations. Fancy things aren't really my style.",
  ["100229201_97"]="And the way you describe it... your puppet doesn't sound like a puppet at all, more like a mentor guiding you in everything, even managing your life.",
  ["100229201_98"]="That's not the kind of life I aspire to as a puppeteer. It feels more like being controlled rather than controlling.",
  ["100229201_99"]="Honestly... it's not that terrible as you make it sound.",
  ["100229301_1"]="Several days had passed.",
  ["100229301_10"]="That explains why you've been coming back later each day and seemed distracted during puppetry practice. The festival must have kept you captivated.",
  ["100229301_100"]="Only then did Yuli realize that the thread wrapped around her wrist was trembling constantly, like a warning.",
  ["100229301_101"]="Our two hours are up... I must leave, Gu Tu.",
  ["100229301_102"]="No, you can't leave just yet.",
  ["100229301_103"]="This stage is set just for you. You need to hear the end of the story before you go.",
  ["100229301_104"]="The dangling strings within Sue's grasp sliced through, only to be engulfed by the billowing waves of flames.",
  ["100229301_105"]="A raging fire consumed the light, the moon, and all subsequent memories...",
  ["100229301_107"]="Upon reopening her eyes, Yuli found herself inexplicably running.",
  ["100229301_108"]="The figure pulling her along... was Gu Tu. Together, they navigated through the flames, seeking refuge within the unscathed theater.",
  ["100229301_109"]="The voices of the people crescendoed, their clamor echoing.",
  ["100229301_11"]="I'm sorry... I'll be more focused from now on.",
  ["100229301_110"]="The firelight soared into the sky, smoke billowing.",
  ["100229301_111"]="Sue's figure had faded into the distance, the fiery glow gradually waning...",
  ["100229301_112"]="Until everything within her sight faded into a ruinous twilight...",
  ["100229301_113"]="These are the fragments Yuli recalls upon revisiting the restored theater.",
  ["100229301_115"]="Whispers of the Past",
  ["100229301_12"]="Heh, I'm just teasing, don't take it to heart. Just don't forget our promise of two hours.",
  ["100229301_13"]="You mentioned making a friend named Gu Tu who knows puppetry... I wonder which puppetry sect she belongs to?",
  ["100229301_14"]="She doesn't belong to any of them. She said she's just a wandering puppeteer.",
  ["100229301_15"]="A wandering puppeteer... Heh, that's a rare sight indeed.",
  ["100229301_16"]="Why not bring invite her here? Making new friends never hurts.",
  ["100229301_17"]="I did, but it seems... she's not too keen on it. Seems like she's used to wandering alone and doesn't want to get too involved with others.",
  ["100229301_18"]="She said she wouldn't stay in one place for long, and today is the last day of the Autumntide Festival.",
  ["100229301_19"]="Just the thought of saying goodbye to her... it makes me sad.",
  ["100229301_2"]="Although the lanterns remained, the Autumntide Festival neared its conclusion.",
  ["100229301_20"]="Parting ways is just how life goes. If it's meant to be, let's make sure we don't leave any regrets.",
  ["100229301_21"]="Now, go. Don't keep your friend waiting.",
  ["100229301_22"]="Got it.",
  ["100229301_23"]="But remember...",
  ["100229301_24"]="Silver threads flicker between Sue's fingers, swiftly forming into a knot.",
  ["100229301_25"]="Come back within two hours. No matter what.",
  ["100229301_26"]="This is a promise between us.",
  ["100229301_28"]="Amidst the bustling crowd, Gu Tu stood at her usual spot where she set up her stall, waiting in silence.",
  ["100229301_29"]="This time, however, she was unaccompanied by her puppet show props.",
  ["100229301_3"]="After tonight... would the sea of lanterns before her vanish like a fleeting dream?",
  ["100229301_30"]="Gu Tu...? Where's your luggage?",
  ["100229301_31"]="Oh, those props? I've packed everything away... Life as a puppeteer can be tough, but sometimes you've got to take a breather.",
  ["100229301_32"]="Today wraps up the Autumntide Festival, and I'm gearing up for my next stop. Now, I just want to unwind a bit before I leave.",
  ["100229301_33"]="If you can stay with me the whole night, then I'll have no regrets this trip.",
  ["100229301_34"]="Yeah... I'll stick around, maybe not the whole night, but...",
  ["100229301_35"]="She still gave you only two hours? Even today?",
  ["100229301_36"]="Hmm.",
  ["100229301_37"]="Two hours... that's the deal.",
  ["100229301_38"]="Did that puppet mention a reason?",
  ["100229301_39"]="Her voice, softer than usual, faintly carried a hint of reproach.",
  ["100229301_4"]="With these sentiments, Yuli involuntarily paused her adjustments to Sue's strings, her gaze drifting towards the city.",
  ["100229301_40"]="A reason...? But a promise is a promise, no reasons needed.",
  ["100229301_41"]="I see, a promise... So, have you considered my proposal yet?",
  ["100229301_42"]="What proposal? Do you mean...?",
  ["100229301_43"]="Us starting a puppet troupe together?",
  ["100229301_44"]="Well.",
  ["100229301_45"]="Gu Tu took Yuli's hand and sighed deeply, yet spoke nothing.",
  ["100229301_46"]="It's just I have a feeling... this is not what I'm meant to do...",
  ["100229301_47"]="I might have forgotten a lot of things... but deep down, I know I have more important duties...",
  ["100229301_48"]="Yuli's voice trailed off, her words finally ceasing.",
  ["100229301_49"]="Gu Tu gestured with her hand, her eyes fixed on the knot on Yuli's wrist.",
  ["100229301_5"]="Yuli?",
  ["100229301_50"]="That's really a cute knot, you know?",
  ["100229301_51"]="I'm so envious of the bond between you and Sue... It must run deep.",
  ["100229301_52"]="Maybe I'm just a wandering puppeteer, and I can't understand the true connection between a puppet and its master.",
  ["100229301_53"]="But I do get that intricate puppets can be as much a burden as they are a joy for their masters...",
  ["100229301_54"]="Look at this knot. It not only ties you to your puppet but binds you tightly to it.",
  ["100229301_55"]="But shouldn't a puppetmaster be in sync with their puppet? Without Sue, I wouldn't have remembered my past or my purpose.",
  ["100229301_56"]="But what if... your identity as a \"puppetmaster\" was imposed on you by others?",
  ["100229301_57"]="...",
  ["100229301_58"]="Moreover, why hold onto those murky memories so tightly?",
  ["100229301_59"]="Memories aren't always wonderful. Even if you've forgotten it all, we had some good times together, didn't we?",
  ["100229301_6"]="Hmm... Ah, I'm sorry, Sue... I'm preparing your strings now.",
  ["100229301_60"]="Have you ever thought about... letting go of that puppet one day?",
  ["100229301_61"]="At the moment, the lanterns beside her extinguished.",
  ["100229301_62"]="Engulfed in darkness, a chill ran up her spine, prompting her to instinctively retract her hand.",
  ["100229301_63"]="Upon raising her gaze, she saw Gu Tu's astonished expression.",
  ["100229301_64"]="I'm sorry, but I can't do that.",
  ["100229301_65"]="Sue means... so much to me.",
  ["100229301_66"]="...",
  ["100229301_67"]="A sigh seemed to echo, but as Yuli gazed at Gu Tu, she was met with a beaming smile.",
  ["100229301_68"]="Hah, don't take it so seriously. I was just kidding.",
  ["100229301_69"]="Come on! Let's go check out those lanterns instead!",
  ["100229301_7"]="No rush. Take your time.",
  ["100229301_70"]="We might run out of time if we keep stalling.",
  ["100229301_71"]="And before you leave, I'll wrap up that story for you.",
  ["100229301_72"]="Gu Tu reverted to her previous cheerful demeanor and clasped Yuli's hand once more.",
  ["100229301_73"]="For a prolonged moment thereafter, however, the two only exchanged silent glances.",
  ["100229301_75"]="It is already late into the night.",
  ["100229301_76"]="Halting their steps, they found themselves before an opera theater.",
  ["100229301_77"]="Gu Tu?",
  ["100229301_78"]="Well... this is our last stop.",
  ["100229301_79"]="I can't tell you how much I appreciate it, Yuli.",
  ["100229301_8"]="I'm just a bit curious... Did you enjoy the lantern show in QingYu City the past few days?",
  ["100229301_80"]="Thanks to you, I had such a wonderful Autumntide Festival in QingYu City.",
  ["100229301_81"]="If we get the chance next year, I'd love to stroll through the lantern show with you again...",
  ["100229301_82"]="But now... let's pick up where we left off with the story.",
  ["100229301_83"]="Gu Tu furrowed her brows, caressing the puppet in her hand as if handling a sword, and continued her story.",
  ["100229301_84"]="So, the girl journeyed alongside the tree guardian, exploring every corner of the kingdom and defeating all foes in her path.",
  ["100229301_85"]="However, like stubborn weeds, those evil entities kept reemerging. Doubts crept in as she wielded her sword... Was this endless crusade truly worth it?",
  ["100229301_86"]="Time marched on, and the next challenge awaited. This time, their target was a notorious rebel leader against Daxun.",
  ["100229301_87"]="Swords clashed, shadows danced, and the girl faced the rebel's army in a fierce, brutal battle. In the end... she emerged victorious.",
  ["100229301_88"]="As the rebel leader fell to her sword, she noticed the leader's sword, no different from hers... Both wielded with a shared mission to save the kingdom.",
  ["100229301_89"]="At that moment, a solemn bell tone sounded in a distance.",
  ["100229301_9"]="Yeah, I had a great time... I met a friend and tried new things I've never done before.",
  ["100229301_90"]="The agreed-upon moment with Sue had arrived.",
  ["100229301_91"]="In a daze, Yuli felt as if she were caught in the midst of a raging battlefield, pushed off a cliff by the enemy forces.",
  ["100229301_92"]="However, amidst the luminous glow, a familiar figure emerged...",
  ["100229301_93"]="It was Sue.",
  ["100229301_94"]="Why here? Why at this moment?",
  ["100229301_95"]="Perplexed, terrified, and puzzled, she felt the grandiose palace in her imagination shattered and collapsed in an instant.",
  ["100229301_96"]="Two words reached her ears, but she couldn't discern if they came from the story or reality.",
  ["100229301_97"]="\"Run away.\"",
  ["100229301_98"]="Gu Tu glanced towards Sue's direction, the palpable hatred emanating from her gaze not escaping Yuli's eyes.",
  ["100229301_99"]="Yet once more, like a mirage, the girl stood there, hands outstretched, adorned with her usual radiant smile.",
  ["100229401_1"]="Since fixing Sue, she has been haunted by a recurring dream.",
  ["100229401_10"]="It's the nightmare again, is it Yuli?",
  ["100229401_11"]="You've had quite a journey. Would you like to take a break?",
  ["100229401_12"]="No need. It's just some fragmented memories.",
  ["100229401_13"]="Once I piece everything together, all of this will make sense.",
  ["100229401_14"]="...Most of the issues at the government are trivial matters, but we still need to handle them carefully.",
  ["100229401_15"]="First, check the database for similar cases, then head to the site. And remember this information...",
  ["100229401_16"]="Before Qing can finish speaking, a red figure suddenly bursts in.",
  ["100229401_17"]="What brings you here, Xin? If I remember correctly, you're not on patrol today.",
  ["100229401_18"]="Because I noticed a suspicious girl... She was walking around the streets and talking to random people, try asking for WeiShi secrets.",
  ["100229401_19"]="I felt it was best not to leave her alone, so I brought her here.",
  ["100229401_2"]="In this dream, her dream self, much like her present self, has forgotten her past but is always accompanied by a figure.",
  ["100229401_20"]="...",
  ["100229401_21"]="Qing brushes her forehead and lets out a soft sigh.",
  ["100229401_22"]="Many of those you tagged as \"suspicious\" and arrested on the spot are ordinary citizens, except for a few actual thieves.",
  ["100229401_23"]="Tell me the truth, Xin. Did you cause trouble outside again?",
  ["100229401_24"]="No, not at all! She was acting really strange!",
  ["100229401_25"]="Oh, let me clarify that part.",
  ["100229401_26"]="...",
  ["100229401_27"]="So, while shopping, you ran into a girl asking about WeiShi and our whereabouts?",
  ["100229401_28"]="Yeah, I thought she was a lost child repeating a new word she picked up somewhere.",
  ["100229401_29"]="I thought about taking her home, but she insisted she was part of WeiShi... To make sense of it, I asked Azi to check on her.",
  ["100229401_3"]="This figure should have been her friend, yet...",
  ["100229401_30"]="But surprisingly, I really found a record that matched perfectly with that girl!",
  ["100229401_31"]="Look, here it is, the profile under the name \"Yuli.\"",
  ["100229401_32"]="Qing accepts the device from Azi's hands, swiftly scanning the screen.",
  ["100229401_33"]="When she lifts her gaze, a solemn expression settles on her face.",
  ["100229401_34"]="Where is the girl you mentioned now?",
  ["100229401_35"]="Before Azi can respond, an unfamiliar black-haired girl peeks in from the main gate of WeiShi, clad in a bamboo-printed cheongsam, her demeanor anxious and timid.",
  ["100229401_36"]="Behind her, a tall woman stands outside the door, exuding confidence as though she were a respected guest.",
  ["100229401_37"]="However, upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that the tall \"woman\" is not human but a meticulously crafted puppet with four arms.",
  ["100229401_38"]="That's a huge wooden dummy!",
  ["100229401_39"]="Hold on, we only brought in that girl. Where did that wooden guy come from?!",
  ["100229401_4"]="It's not like you absolutely have to find your memories, is it?",
  ["100229401_40"]="A puppetmaster...",
  ["100229401_41"]="Unlike Xin and Azi, Qing displays no surprise at Sue's presence, her expression relaxed.",
  ["100229401_42"]="That's not how we treat our guests, Xin and Azi.",
  ["100229401_43"]="Please come in, dear guests.",
  ["100229401_44"]="Although Yuli's name is recorded in the archive, there are only a few words about her.",
  ["100229401_45"]="It takes only a brief moment to convey all the details.",
  ["100229401_46"]="My apologies, Yuli.",
  ["100229401_47"]="As you can see, the only relevant information we have in the records is your name and your identification as a puppetmaster.",
  ["100229401_48"]="Honestly, I didn't know you before you lost your memory, and I have no recollection of you joining the Weishi Society either.",
  ["100229401_49"]="How can this be...?",
  ["100229401_5"]="Your past might not be as wonderful as you believe, you know?",
  ["100229401_50"]="Sue mentioned that I would find my memories once I came here...",
  ["100229401_51"]="However, Master Yuanquan did speak of you a long time ago.",
  ["100229401_52"]="Yuanquan?",
  ["100229401_53"]="\"To guide the world with profound wisdom, akin to a profound spring.\" Hence Yuanquan, meaning \"profound spring.\" He's regarded as the most knowledgeable and wise member in WeiShi.",
  ["100229401_54"]="He used to share some stories about puppetry.",
  ["100229401_55"]="Legend has it that puppetmasters flourished in the past but eventually declined, branching off into different directions.",
  ["100229401_56"]="Many of these branches vanished with time, their legacies lost, but two of them have survived.",
  ["100229401_57"]="One branch focuses on perfecting the art of puppetry, passing down techniques through generations. This expertise is known as \"Contraption\" among the Four Arts of the Tang Sect. The other branch delves into the theoretical aspects, applying the principles of puppetry to create new contraptions.",
  ["100229401_58"]="Which branch do you think I should visit first?",
  ["100229401_59"]="Well, both options are a bit distant from CangLin City.",
  ["100229401_6"]="...",
  ["100229401_60"]="And the real issue is... you don't exactly belong to either of them.",
  ["100229401_61"]="What?",
  ["100229401_62"]="According to Master Yuanquan, the techniques you're using predate all of them... similar to the very origins of puppetry.",
  ["100229401_63"]="So, I'm afraid they might not be of much help.",
  ["100229401_64"]="B-but what should I do then? If even WeiShi can't help, how can I retrieve my memories...?",
  ["100229401_65"]="Yuli's despondency deepens upon Qing's response.",
  ["100229401_66"]="Please try to stay calm, Yuli.",
  ["100229401_67"]="While I'm not a doctor, I've encountered my fair share of memory loss cases. Often, it's a defense mechanism of the mind against trauma.",
  ["100229401_68"]="Therefore... take your time here. Meanwhile, I'll arrange for someone to dig into your past.",
  ["100229401_69"]="If you have anything else on your mind, just let me know. We'll do our best to help you out.",
  ["100229401_7"]="Whenever she tries to call out that name, her memories dissipate like a receding tide, leaving no trace.",
  ["100229401_70"]="Thank you, Qing...",
  ["100229401_71"]="Actually, I could use some assistance at the moment.",
  ["100229401_72"]="The gears in Sue's right wrist were damaged during the journey and need repairs. The fix itself is not complex, but finding spare parts...",
  ["100229401_73"]="I understand. We have some old puppets lying around. Maybe you can salvage parts from them.",
  ["100229401_74"]="However, for security reasons, those puppets are not in CangLin City currently. We'll need to arrange their transport here.",
  ["100229401_75"]="You've been through a lot with the memory loss and the journey. Please stay here for a few days and rest well.",
  ["100229401_76"]="Fleeting Life",
  ["100229401_8"]="As she opens her eyes, the dream landscape fades, replaced by an orderly, modern cityscape.",
  ["100229401_9"]="...",
  ["100229402_1"]="So... you're really leaving?",
  ["100229402_10"]="Do you have your friend's contact info? I could give her a call to confirm.",
  ["100229402_11"]="Yuli shakes her head gently, her gaze unwavering.",
  ["100229402_12"]="Even if I can't reach her and I'm unsure if she'll show up, I still... want to go to QingYu City.",
  ["100229402_13"]="I have this feeling that all the question about my memories will be answer there.",
  ["100229402_14"]="But...",
  ["100229402_15"]="Qing listens in silence, adjusting her glasses thoughtfully.",
  ["100229402_16"]="That's enough, Azi.",
  ["100229402_17"]="If she's made up her mind, we should respect her decision.",
  ["100229402_18"]="I've informed our crew from CangLin City and QingYu City. They'll be ready to assist you.",
  ["100229402_19"]="If you need anything along the way—food, a place to stay, or transportation—just reach out.",
  ["100229402_2"]="Yeah, I just recalled... something important.",
  ["100229402_20"]="Thank you...",
  ["100229402_21"]="I really appreciate all of you for your help. I'll repay your kindness in the future.",
  ["100229402_22"]="As Yuli respectfully bows, her puppet, sensing her master's demeanor, also bows towards the crowd slowly.",
  ["100229402_23"]="By the time everyone looks up, Yuli and her puppet have departed, leaving a faint aroma of wood at the doorstep.",
  ["100229402_24"]="Is it really okay to let her go like this...?",
  ["100229402_25"]="The lantern show in QingYu City ended decades ago. How could she possibly meet anyone there? Maybe I should... call her back?",
  ["100229402_26"]="...",
  ["100229402_27"]="Qing remains silent, gazing at the empty doorstep, lost in memories.",
  ["100229402_28"]="...Well, that wraps up the puppetmaster's past.",
  ["100229402_29"]="But there's still one thing that puzzles me.",
  ["100229402_3"]="As she closes her eyes, the once elusive words become clearer.",
  ["100229402_30"]="According to what you've said, WeiShi and the puppetmaster ancestor had an agreement—to guide their descendants when they visit.",
  ["100229402_31"]="So, if a puppetmaster does show up, what should we do exactly?",
  ["100229402_32"]="We don't have to do anything specific. \"Guiding\" them means easing their concerns, answering their questions, and that's it.",
  ["100229402_33"]="It's like planting a tree, nurturing its roots, letting it grow naturally... and waiting for it to thrive.",
  ["100229402_34"]="(Is this what Master Yuanquan meant back then?)",
  ["100229402_35"]="Relief shows in Qing's furrowed brow.",
  ["100229402_36"]="No need to call her back. Let's leave her be.",
  ["100229402_37"]="She's a puppetmaster. She can take care of herself.",
  ["100229402_4"]="Thanks to you, I had such a wonderful Autumntide Festival in QingYu City.",
  ["100229402_5"]="If we get the chance next year, I'd love to stroll through the lantern show with you again...",
  ["100229402_6"]="A long while back, a friend and I visited QingYu City.",
  ["100229402_7"]="We made a promise back then—to reunite at the Lantern Festival during next year's  Autumntide. Now, it's time for me to fulfill that promise.",
  ["100229402_8"]="Wait, the Autumntide Festival is coming up... but didn't you lose your memories a while back? What if years have passed since you made that promise?",
  ["100229402_9"]="...",
  ["100229601_1"]="As for the lantern show you mentioned... When that old man was alive, he did recount that every Autumntide Festival, QingYu City would be aglow with lanterns and bustling with life.",
  ["100229601_10"]="Do you remember what happened back then, Sue?",
  ["100229601_11"]="...",
  ["100229601_12"]="Forget it, it's only natural you don't know. You were stuck outside, blocked by flames.",
  ["100229601_13"]="It's all in the past. You don't have to... push yourself so hard.",
  ["100229601_14"]="...",
  ["100229601_15"]="After a moment of reflection, Yuli raises her head decisively.",
  ["100229601_16"]="I made a promise to her. I want to uncover all the answers, no matter what they may be.",
  ["100229601_17"]="The Awakening",
  ["100229601_2"]="I remember the address—it's over on the west side of the city. There's still an old opera house there... Hold on, I'll draw it out for you.",
  ["100229601_3"]="No, you can't leave just yet.",
  ["100229601_4"]="This stage is set just for you. You need to hear the end of the story before you go.",
  ["100229601_5"]="...",
  ["100229601_6"]="Her memory abruptly ends here.",
  ["100229601_7"]="Despite her best efforts, what happened next eludes her recollection.",
  ["100229601_8"]="Yuli gazes around in blank confusion. The only sight before her eyes is the theater building, everything maintained in its former state.",
  ["100229601_9"]="I... I've been here before.",
  ["100229602_1"]="Gu Tu is right behind this door... Taking a deep breath, Yuli slowly pushes it open.",
  ["100229602_10"]="Tears trickle down onto the back of her hand, searing like the embers from that fateful night.",
  ["100229602_100"]="Instinctively, she advances, observing as the light spots shift and expand, morphing into a lantern in her hand, and then a full moon in the sky.",
  ["100229602_101"]="Illuminated by the moonlight, she finally discerns the shadow blanketing the sky. A certain entity rises from the earth, extending its myriad branches in all directions, each culminating in a figure at its end.",
  ["100229602_102"]="It dawns on her at last... It is a tree, a colossal tree.",
  ["100229602_11"]="Forgotten images surge forth like a tidal wave: the fire, the puppets, the crowd... and the figure atop the theater, donning a smile devoid of warmth.",
  ["100229602_12"]="The heat wave struck her face as the fire raged on.",
  ["100229602_13"]="The flames lapped at the night, warping the sky into amber-tinted glass.",
  ["100229602_14"]="Even from atop the theater, the sounds of wood crunching and the shuffling footsteps of the anxious crowd could be distinctly heard.",
  ["100229602_15"]="Those puppets setting fires... Are they also your props?",
  ["100229602_16"]="No, the \"puppet show\" was a lie from the start. Am I right?",
  ["100229602_17"]="Puppets are driven by memories. They're more than mere marionettes if they can set an entire theater ablaze.",
  ["100229602_18"]="Why are you doing this, Gu Tu?!",
  ["100229602_19"]="However, the girl simply leaned against the rails, looking away and chuckling mockingly, detached from the unfolding events.",
  ["100229602_2"]="...",
  ["100229602_20"]="Because I want to wrap up the story for you.",
  ["100229602_21"]="This is the final act, so the stage needs to be set dramatically. Don't you think?",
  ["100229602_22"]="Enough! I won't join you in this farce!",
  ["100229602_23"]="Sue's still in fire! I've got to find her and save everyone at the lantern show...",
  ["100229602_24"]="Upon hearing that word, Gu Tu's expression immediately turned chilly.",
  ["100229602_25"]="Sue! Sue! Sue! It's all about that lousy puppet every moment! Enough!",
  ["100229602_26"]="Argh...",
  ["100229602_27"]="As the word left her lips, crimson strings flashed by. A sharp pain shot through Yuli's body as if pierced by steel needles, causing her to halt involuntarily.",
  ["100229602_28"]="Before she realized it, red strings had wound around her, held by none other than Gu Tu standing nearby.",
  ["100229602_29"]="That's better. Now, sit back and let me finish this story!",
  ["100229602_3"]="Gu Tu?",
  ["100229602_30"]="In the blink of an eye, Gu Tu resumes her usual smile... but with a hint of something sinister at the corner of her mouth.",
  ["100229602_31"]="So, last time, I mentioned how the girl defeated the rebel leader, only to find out that her opponent, too, had a mission from the tree guardian to save the kingdom.",
  ["100229602_32"]="A blood-stained diary slipped out from the rebel's clothes. Out of curiosity, the girl flipped through its pages, discovering stories that felt oddly familiar but completely unknown to her.",
  ["100229602_33"]="The mechanical dragon she dismantled once brought bountiful rains for her ancestors; the mechanical city she demolished once shielded people from wars; the massive paper kite she burned once guided lost travelers.",
  ["100229602_34"]="Wait... those \"evil entities\" she destroyed were once the guardians of the kingdom?",
  ["100229602_35"]="That's right. The tree guardian had been deceiving the girl all along. Truth was, the land of Daxun was cursed, and all who survived there would eventually descend into madness.",
  ["100229602_36"]="One day, the savior girl would meet the same fate as the evil entities she defeated, eventually being hunted down by future generations.",
  ["100229602_37"]="So, the girl learned the truth... did she turn on the tree guardian?",
  ["100229602_38"]="No, she ran away.",
  ["100229602_39"]="She yelled, \"I'm out of here, you cursed guardian! I won't listen to your nonsense anymore!\", and left the kingdom without a second glance.",
  ["100229602_4"]="At that moment, the boundary between memory and reality blurs.",
  ["100229602_40"]="...",
  ["100229602_41"]="So, you've pieced it together, right?",
  ["100229602_42"]="The memories you're holding onto, and the puppetmaster role you value so much... they're just chains imposed by those above, much like the girl in the story.",
  ["100229602_43"]="Truth is, you can break free from it all and live your own life.",
  ["100229602_44"]="So, you want me to leave Sue?",
  ["100229602_45"]="Exactly, I want to free you from these pointless obligations.",
  ["100229602_46"]="The flames outside the theater grew more intense, casting a flickering light on the surroundings, evoking Yuli's memories like unfurled scrolls.",
  ["100229602_47"]="The other person wasn't wrong. Though much of her memory remained a blank, an invisible thread still tugged at her... Was she really going to search for the past? Was she truly going to let herself be manipulated like a puppet on strings?",
  ["100229602_48"]="Contemplating this, Yuli lifted her head and grasped Gu Tu's hand.",
  ["100229602_49"]="...I see.",
  ["100229602_5"]="However, the girl named \"Gu Tu\" remains seated silently in the corner, her eyes closed.",
  ["100229602_50"]="Fantastic! I knew you'd make the same choice I did! Now, let's...",
  ["100229602_51"]="Yuli...?",
  ["100229602_52"]="As Gu Tu habitually took Yuli's hands, she felt resistance.",
  ["100229602_53"]="Yuli stood motionless as if rooted to the spot.",
  ["100229602_54"]="About that story you shared... there's a detail that caught my attention.",
  ["100229602_55"]="Was that girl merely viewed as a tool to be used and discarded by the tree guardian?",
  ["100229602_56"]="Hmph, probably more than that. At the very least, she's a sword he forged with his own hands.",
  ["100229602_57"]="But that kind of sentiment is just like humans valuing their useful scissors... It's meaningless!",
  ["100229602_58"]="But if that's the case, why did the guardian just let her walk away?",
  ["100229602_59"]="...What?",
  ["100229602_6"]="Yuli reaches out her hand, but upon contact, the \"girl\" emits a creaking sound like wood crunching.",
  ["100229602_60"]="The guardian in the story was nearly all-powerful. So, if he had sensed any hostility from the girl, he could have easily labeled her a threat and eliminated her as an \"evil entity,\" right?",
  ["100229602_61"]="This detail doesn't really matter!",
  ["100229602_62"]="No, it does.",
  ["100229602_63"]="Yuli raised her gaze, her eyes filled with unwavering resolve.",
  ["100229602_64"]="If I were to continue this tale, the girl wouldn't have abandoned the guardian. Instead, she would have stuck to her mission until the very end.",
  ["100229602_65"]="Even if her fate was sealed... the moment she made a pledge and set off on her journey, her resolve was genuine.",
  ["100229602_66"]="I believe... she wouldn't betray her true self.",
  ["100229602_67"]="Shut up! Enough! What do you really know about her?!",
  ["100229602_68"]="Yuli, the bond between a puppetmaster and their puppet is unbreakable. Remember your promise.",
  ["100229602_69"]="If you ever face something too tough, just untie this knot... and I'll be there in a flash.",
  ["100229602_7"]="Like a broken-winged butterfly, the figure before her collapses, scattering parts across the ground... Yuli recognizes that touch, a hollowness unique to puppets.",
  ["100229602_70"]="Amidst the red threads enveloping her, the silver string glimmering on her wrist stood out.",
  ["100229602_71"]="She realized that the time had come to untie it.",
  ["100229602_72"]="You idiot! Do you have any idea what you're doing?!",
  ["100229602_73"]="I'm... trying to stop you!",
  ["100229602_74"]="The silver string detached from her hand, tracing a sharp path through the night.",
  ["100229602_75"]="Amidst the billowing heat waves, a familiar figure emerged from the flames.",
  ["100229602_76"]="I had hoped we could become good friends, really close friends...",
  ["100229602_77"]="But in the end, you're nothing more than a foolish and naive...",
  ["100229602_78"]="Her subsequent words became inaudible.",
  ["100229602_79"]="In the next moment, she was suddenly lifted into the air by the entwining strings, plummeting towards the ground.",
  ["100229602_8"]="So... about that promise... those memories...",
  ["100229602_80"]="Through the night sky, descending into the blaze below.",
  ["100229602_81"]="...Until she landed in a firm embrace.",
  ["100229602_82"]="...",
  ["100229602_83"]="So, that's... the whole story.",
  ["100229602_84"]="Having recalled her past, Yuli feels washed over by a profound sense of melancholy rather than relief.",
  ["100229602_85"]="I remember everything now, Sue... The lantern show, the puppetmaster, the fire, and all our shared experiences...",
  ["100229602_86"]="Can you tell me, Sue...",
  ["100229602_87"]="Her mind is filled with myriad emotions seeking solace and myriads questions seeking answers.",
  ["100229602_88"]="Huh?",
  ["100229602_89"]="However, before she can articulate her thoughts, she feels a sudden loss of strength, akin to a marionette with broken strings falling.",
  ["100229602_9"]="I... I remember everything now...",
  ["100229602_90"]="...",
  ["100229602_91"]="Yuli collapses into Sue's arms.",
  ["100229602_92"]="Sue's countenance remains serene and gentle, yet a mix of sorrow and affection, unique to humans, wells up in her eyes.",
  ["100229602_93"]="That's good enough, my dear girl... You've done well.",
  ["100229602_94"]="Now, take a well-deserved rest.",
  ["100229602_95"]="Instantly, a rush of memories floods her mind, scenes flashing by rapidly.",
  ["100229602_96"]="Memories of Sue teaching her, Gu Tu offering pastries, Xin and Azi accompanying her through the streets, and Qing answering her questions...",
  ["100229602_97"]="And memories from long, long time ago.",
  ["100229602_98"]="She sees the ancient QingYu City, the boundless pristine forests, and the ancients enjoying a play in a teahouse and applauding for puppeteers.",
  ["100229602_99"]="It is as though she traversed the realm known as Daxun herself, journey alongside the heroic girl and the tender guardian, through the barren expanse that stretched beyond.",
  ["100229701_1"]="You didn't come here just for catching up, did you?",
  ["100229701_10"]="To fix a \"being\" that holds significance to me.",
  ["100229701_11"]="No, I already found her and fixed her, but...",
  ["100229701_12"]="QingYu City... puppetmaster... Yuli... Gu Tu... Sue... and the lantern show...",
  ["100229701_13"]="The fragmented words continue to whirl in her mind, yet a coherent sentence remains elusive.",
  ["100229701_14"]="Until that familiar call echoes in her ears again.",
  ["100229701_15"]="Yuli?",
  ["100229701_16"]="Yuli.",
  ["100229701_17"]="Upon opening her eyes, Yuli sees Sue sitting in front of her.",
  ["100229701_18"]="She notices the gears and parts in her own hand. It seems she is currently engaged in maintaining Sue.",
  ["100229701_19"]="Oh, this is the first time I've seen you so distracted. Did you remember something intriguing?",
  ["100229701_2"]="...",
  ["100229701_20"]="No, I think I just... had a dream.",
  ["100229701_21"]="Sorry... I'm replacing your parts now.",
  ["100229701_22"]="A dream, huh... Maybe you can share with me what you dreamt?",
  ["100229701_23"]="I can't quite remember...",
  ["100229701_24"]="All I remember is that in the dream, there was a girl who had lost her memories and forgotten something crucial, striving to regain them.",
  ["100229701_25"]="Just like... where I am now.",
  ["100229701_26"]="It's alright, Yuli. You've already done well.",
  ["100229701_27"]="Sue tenderly runs her fingers through the girl's hair.",
  ["100229701_28"]="The other day, WeiShi members came by and left a letter.",
  ["100229701_29"]="The letter mentioned that they discovered an ancient mansion, possibly linked to your lineage.",
  ["100229701_3"]="Well, since you're asking personally, I'll make an exception for you.",
  ["100229701_30"]="You've been honing your puppetry skills, so how about we visit there today? We might uncover some unexpected findings.",
  ["100229701_31"]="Do you think... I'll uncover my memories there?",
  ["100229701_32"]="It's worth a shot, don't you think?",
  ["100229701_33"]="I've heard that the mansion holds ancient scrolls on puppetry. Even if they don't shed light on your past, they could enhance your abilities.",
  ["100229701_34"]="Yuli twirls the delicate threads with her fingers, eventually nodding decisively after a prolonged period.",
  ["100229701_35"]="In that case, let's head over there.",
  ["100229701_36"]="My Former Self",
  ["100229701_4"]="The mansion is ready. You know what to do.",
  ["100229701_5"]="Upon regaining consciousness, she is immediately aware of a splitting headache.",
  ["100229701_6"]="Ugh...",
  ["100229701_7"]="I'm a <color=#FEC66B>puppetmaster</color>... I must find...",
  ["100229701_8"]="What exactly am I seeking?",
  ["100229701_9"]="I'm a <color=#FEC66B>puppetmaster</color>... I must fix...",
  ["100229702_1"]="Did you uncover any clues in those books?",
  ["100229702_10"]="Still... those puppetmasters' names are hidden. I wonder who they could be?",
  ["100229702_11"]="The first Yuanquan kept their identities concealed, likely for their safety and that of their descendants.",
  ["100229702_12"]="You now know that even among those puppetmasters, there were some black sheep.",
  ["100229702_13"]="But explaining all the complexities might take some time. That's a tale for another day.",
  ["100229702_14"]="Well...",
  ["100229702_15"]="Yuli nods subtly and retrieves a worn scroll from behind her back.",
  ["100229702_16"]="And I found this on the bookshelf. The story... is quite captivating.",
  ["100229702_17"]="The scroll depicts a courageous savior gazing from a distance at the ancient city constructed circling the towering tree.",
  ["100229702_18"]="It's a shame that the latter part of the scroll was damaged in the fire...",
  ["100229702_19"]="Well...",
  ["100229702_2"]="No...",
  ["100229702_20"]="Sue accepts the scroll from Yuli's hands, delicately flips through it, then returns it to her hands.",
  ["100229702_21"]="This seems to be a script for a puppet show.",
  ["100229702_22"]="We can check with WeiShi to see if they have any copies of this script.",
  ["100229702_23"]="Or, if you're interested...",
  ["100229702_24"]="Why not try completing the script yourself?",
  ["100229702_25"]="Me? How can someone with fragmented memories complete an ancient script...?",
  ["100229702_26"]="Honestly, I think you should have more faith in yourself.",
  ["100229702_27"]="Memories hold their worth, but forgetting some... isn't necessarily a bad thing. Without those ties to the past, you can truly carry on and conclude the story where your predecessors left off.",
  ["100229702_28"]="Whatever way you choose to conclude this story, I'll be here to help.",
  ["100229702_29"]="It's okay, Sue... I'm alright now. I mean it.",
  ["100229702_3"]="Those books from the ancestor are enlightening, but... there's nothing about my past.",
  ["100229702_30"]="To be honest, I no longer cling to my lost memories as tightly as before.",
  ["100229702_31"]="...",
  ["100229702_32"]="That ancestor detailed an incident in one of the books.",
  ["100229702_33"]="When he was a child, he accidentally tangled the strings of several puppets during a practice session...",
  ["100229702_34"]="\"This one is mine. That one is the master's. That one is the sect master's...\" The more he tried to sort them, the more chaotic it became, leading to a dead end.",
  ["100229702_35"]="In the end, he had to cut and reattach all the strings... but to his dismay, those puppets' movements became even more chaotic.",
  ["100229702_36"]="Heh, yeah. He didn't keep that mishap a secret forever. When his master discovered it, he faced a stern scolding and a month of hand-weaving as punishment.",
  ["100229702_37"]="That's not the point.",
  ["100229702_38"]="Yuli smiles and shakes her head.",
  ["100229702_39"]="I just believe that... instead of dwelling on the past, it's better to let go and find a new path.",
  ["100229702_4"]="Still, from the records here, I've managed to piece together what caused the fire in QingYu City a century ago.",
  ["100229702_40"]="Sue, you mentioned that once my memories return, you want to take me to meet Master Yuanquan of WeiShi, right?",
  ["100229702_41"]="Yes, I did... we had an agreement.",
  ["100229702_42"]="Then why not go now? Somehow, hearing the name \"WeiShi\" brings me a sense of peace.",
  ["100229702_43"]="...I see.",
  ["100229702_44"]="Then let's head there right away.",
  ["100229702_45"]="Sue takes out a piece of string, looping it around Yuli's wrist before gently tying a knot.",
  ["100229702_46"]="As Yuli pushes open the door, the azure sky above QingYu City gleams bright and clear.",
  ["100229702_47"]="All her regrets and confusions of the past have morphed into loops of strings, tethered at the girl's fingertips.",
  ["100229702_48"]="When the breeze passes through, it blurs the distinction between the one holding the strings, the puppetmaster or the puppet herself.",
  ["100229702_5"]="It appears a rogue puppetmaster used their puppets to ignite a massive fire during the lantern show at the Autumntide Festival, resulting in a tragic disaster.",
  ["100229702_6"]="The WeiShi puppetmasters bravely fought back, eventually stopping the attacker and extinguishing the flames, but they sustained severe injuries in the process...",
  ["100229702_7"]="Under the guidance of the first Yuanquan, they departed to heal, never to return to QingYu City again...",
  ["100229702_8"]="That's true.",
  ["100229702_9"]="Well, solving an old mystery like this already makes this journey worthwhile.",
  ["100229801_1"]="Memories thereafter become fragmented.",
  ["100229801_10"]="Recalling the past should bring solace, yet why is it evoking such profound sorrow within her?",
  ["100229801_11"]="The Journey Home",
  ["100229801_2"]="Yuli stood amidst the streets of QingYu City, frozen in place.",
  ["100229801_3"]="You don't have to dig up your memories, if you ask me.",
  ["100229801_4"]="Your past might not be as wonderful as you believe, you know?",
  ["100229801_5"]="Memories flicker like swaying lanterns. The visage of the girl has marred by time, with only the name \"Gu Tu\" resonating faintly.",
  ["100229801_6"]="So, what happened next?",
  ["100229801_7"]="Did she finish that story in the end?",
  ["100229801_8"]="...",
  ["100229801_9"]="A profound sense of hollowness pervades her chest, the faint sound of wind through her ears reminiscent of distant weeping.",
  ["100229802_1"]="This is marvelous! You've really taken care of all of them... I'm so glad you were here. Who knows how this would've turned out otherwise...",
  ["100229802_10"]="So, we store those props here. We might never use them again, but they symbolize a legacy...",
  ["100229802_11"]="A puppeteer...",
  ["100229802_12"]="Do you happen to know a girl named \"Gu Tu\"? She's a puppeteer just like your great-grandfather.",
  ["100229802_13"]="We made a promise to meet at the lantern show in QingYu City, but now...",
  ["100229802_14"]="Gu Tu? Oh, what a coincidence! My family name is \"Gu\"! But... I've no idea who this \"Gu Tu\" is. Maybe a distant relative?",
  ["100229802_15"]="As for the lantern show you mentioned... When that old man was alive, he did recount that every Autumntide Festival, QingYu City would be aglow with lanterns and bustling with life.",
  ["100229802_16"]="I remember the address—it's over on the west side of the city. There's still an old opera house there... Hold on, I'll draw it out for you.",
  ["100229802_17"]="Unexpectedly, the clues intertwine. As Yuli examines the sketchy map in her hand, the haze in her eyes dissipates.",
  ["100229802_18"]="Thank you for your help. I'll never forget your kindness.",
  ["100229802_19"]="Oh, thank you! It's me who should be thanking you!",
  ["100229802_2"]="You're welcome. I just did what needed to be done. However, I do have a question.",
  ["100229802_20"]="But...",
  ["100229802_21"]="The resident hesitates momentarily, as if recalling something.",
  ["100229802_22"]="Why did you and your friend agree to meet there? Except for the theater itself, everything else was destroyed in the fire during my great-grandfather's time, you know?",
  ["100229802_23"]="Huh, where's that girl?",
  ["100229802_24"]="By the time his words are uttered, Yuli has already left.",
  ["100229802_3"]="Yuli swiftly surveys the warehouse, a myriad of emotions flickering across her eyes.",
  ["100229802_4"]="Swords, fans, puppets, curtains, and a stage... despite the dust, Yuli recognizes these props.",
  ["100229802_5"]="You said this is a warehouse for clutter, but why are there props for puppet shows here?",
  ["100229802_6"]="Oh, that's because my ancestor was a puppeteer.",
  ["100229802_7"]="Huh?",
  ["100229802_8"]="According to my great-grandfather, our family were traveling puppeteers who journeyed across the country. When he arrived in QingYu City, he met my great-grandmother by chance, and they settled down here.",
  ["100229802_9"]="While it's common for a son to inherit his father's craft, puppetry wasn't very popular and only made it to my great-grandfather's generation. Nonetheless, we can't bear to let it go completely...",
  ["100231101_1"]="Bearing the Mantle",
  ["100231101_2"]="From atop the ancient Tianli home, one can see the black mountain peaks rising through the clouds, with forest paths stretching deep into the valley.",
  ["100231101_3"]="In mid-spring, the landscape is full of life.",
  ["100231101_4"]="Residents of QingYu City are often hesitant to enter the dense forest, worried that one wrong step could lead them into a labyrinth—where, by the time they find their way out, decades may have passed.",
  ["100231101_5"]="But for members of the Tianli clan, the forest of Mount Tianque is a sanctuary.",
  ["100231101_6"]="If one holds their breath and listens closely, they can hear mountain springs flowing, mingling with the wind rustling through the trees, intertwined with the distant sounds of children's laughter, bringing vitality to this remote place.",
  ["100231101_7"]="Perhaps most of the Tianli youths have gathered by the springs, enjoying carefree moments together.",
  ["100231101_8"]="So, why am I left alone, practicing the Tianli blade technique in a quiet courtyard?",
  ["100231102_1"]="As Li Chi walks up the mountain trail, the sound of his friends' voices gradually grows clearer.",
  ["100231102_10"]="...",
  ["100231102_11"]="Why didn't you tell me you were coming up to the mountain? Keeping some fun secret from me?",
  ["100231102_12"]="The two Tianli teenagers standing in the stream exchange amused glances before bursting into laughter.",
  ["100231102_13"]="Oh, we figured you were too busy with important stuff to hang out with us, Your Patriarch-ship.",
  ["100231102_14"]="Keep that sarcastic tone up and I'll dip you headfirst in the river.",
  ["100231102_15"]="Mercy, Your Patriarch-ship! Please, forgive us.",
  ["100231102_16"]="I said, stop with that \"patriarch\" already.",
  ["100231102_17"]="Alright, Li Chi, what brings you here today? Shouldn't you be getting ready for the ceremony and those... trials or something?",
  ["100231102_18"]="Trials, huh? What's the point? If someone else wants to lead, they can have it.",
  ["100231102_19"]="They say I'm the next patriarch, but let's be real, they just need someone to fill that vacant seat.",
  ["100231102_2"]="Upon his arrival, the once lively atmosphere turns slightly awkward. There is a brief silence before his friends greet him with teasing smiles.",
  ["100231102_20"]="Tell me, which clan leader gets scolded every single day?",
  ["100231102_21"]="If you talk back, they'll hit you with those \"ancestral rules,\" stating they've been around for thousands of years.",
  ["100231102_22"]="I bet even the elders themselves don't know why those rules exist.",
  ["100231102_23"]="So, are you thinking of backing out?",
  ["100231102_24"]="Tsk, I'd love to, but...",
  ["100231102_25"]="I'd be hanging out with you all ages ago if it weren't for these dumb trials.",
  ["100231102_26"]="Although the elder vaguely mentioned that the trials have something to do with blades...",
  ["100231102_27"]="How hard can it be, right? Just a bit of blade forging and all that jazz...",
  ["100231102_28"]="But you know how stern the elder can get.",
  ["100231102_29"]="The moment he catches me not in the forge, he'll be quick to scold, \"Li Chi! Where are you goofing off now?\"",
  ["100231102_3"]="Hey, look who's here! Your Patriarch-ship!",
  ["100231102_30"]="Isn't that just his way of showing he cares? It's a good thing, in my opinion!",
  ["100231102_31"]="Oh, how about I pass on that \"good thing\" to you?",
  ["100231102_32"]="Heehee, no thanks. I'd rather not be stuck in that scorching forge all day.",
  ["100231102_33"]="By the way, Li Chi, could you forge us some blades to play with?",
  ["100231102_34"]="Li Chi notices his friend's playful gesture, then looks away.",
  ["100231102_35"]="No, this won't do.",
  ["100231102_36"]="Come on, don't be stingy. You've been crafting blades for days, and even the rejects are more than enough for us!",
  ["100231102_37"]="Don't talk like I forged those blades for fun.",
  ["100231102_38"]="The blade represents the essence of our clan and the authority of the patriarch... That's what the elder preached to me in the forge.",
  ["100231102_39"]="So, you're saying you'll be the only one parading around with those fancy blades once you're the patriarch?",
  ["100231102_4"]="What brings you down to mingle with us common folk today?",
  ["100231102_40"]="That's not what I meant at all!",
  ["100231102_41"]="Ohhh! Li Chi's getting all riled up again!",
  ["100231102_42"]="But then again, you don't need those blades to show your status, right? You could do something else, you know?",
  ["100231102_43"]="What's with the looks on your faces?",
  ["100231102_44"]="Oh, it's nothing, really.",
  ["100231102_45"]="They exchange a joyful gaze.",
  ["100231102_46"]="Remember that? The patriarch has to lead the dance at various ceremonies.",
  ["100231102_47"]="Are you ready to show off your dance moves now, future patriarch?",
  ["100231102_48"]="...",
  ["100231102_49"]="Stop teasing me!",
  ["100231102_5"]="Hmph... you're still in the mood for jokes. Looks like we're good.",
  ["100231102_50"]="Run away, everyone!",
  ["100231102_51"]="His Patriarch-ship is about to unleash his might!",
  ["100231102_52"]="Remember what I said!",
  ["100231102_53"]="The crowd laughs and disperses. As Li Chi attempts to catch up with the teenager in the lead, he feels a gentle tug at the corner of his coat.",
  ["100231102_54"]="Who's pulling me...? Oh, it's you? Why are you jumping in on the teasing too?",
  ["100231102_55"]="The child grasps Li Chi's garment, his eyes brimming with genuine expectation and longing.",
  ["100231102_56"]="Brother Chi, are you really going to become the patriarch?",
  ["100231102_57"]="Well... I can't deny it...",
  ["100231102_58"]="I knew you were the toughest of them all! Only the toughest can be the patriarch!",
  ["100231102_59"]="What do you mean by \"toughest\"? The elders keep targeting me, and those guys won't show me any respect. Didn't you see that?",
  ["100231102_6"]="And stop calling me \"patriarch.\" I'm not in charge yet.",
  ["100231102_60"]="The child scratches his head, perplexed by Li Chi's remark.",
  ["100231102_61"]="But Brother Chi, you've really got it all—swordplay, forging blades… even dancing!",
  ["100231102_62"]="...",
  ["100231102_63"]="I mean it! Becoming patriarch shouldn't be too hard for you!",
  ["100231102_64"]="Ugh... this \"patriarch\" just feels like an empty title.",
  ["100231102_65"]="So many rules and responsibilities… it's exhausting.",
  ["100231102_66"]="Always taking orders, constantly solving clan issues big or small...",
  ["100231102_67"]="That's not the kind of leader I want to be.",
  ["100231102_68"]="Then what kind of leader do you want to be?",
  ["100231102_69"]="Umm...",
  ["100231102_7"]="Oh, come on. Just messing around.",
  ["100231102_70"]="Li Chi tries to say something but finds himself stumbling over his words.",
  ["100231102_71"]="Maybe someone like our ancestor, Li Jun...",
  ["100231102_72"]="He might not have conquered the world, but his reputation within the clan is unparalleled!",
  ["100231102_73"]="Unpara... dise?",
  ["100231102_74"]="I mean, he was the strongest, most admired person in the whole Tianli clan!",
  ["100231102_75"]="Our clan thrived on martial arts. If I'd been born in Li Jun's time, all the sword training I've done would be put into actual use.",
  ["100231102_76"]="But now? There's no real battlefield left. How am I supposed to earn respect? Even Li Jun would probably feel frustrated if he lived today.",
  ["100231102_77"]="So who's stronger? You or Li Jun?",
  ["100231102_78"]="Heh... no contest. I'm nowhere near his level.",
  ["100231102_79"]="I was just trying to take an example given how prestigious he is…",
  ["100231102_8"]="You're Lord Li Jun's only descendants here. Who else but you would step up as the next patriarch?",
  ["100231102_80"]="Ahh, he was the greatest hero of his time. It made perfect sense that people chose him as patriarch. I doubt he ever felt powerless the way I do...",
  ["100231102_81"]="Anyway, sorry for dumping all this on you.",
  ["100231102_82"]="Come on, let's head back.",
  ["100231102_83"]="Yeah! Carry me, brother Chi!",
  ["100231102_9"]="Worried we'd tattle it to the elder?",
  ["100231201_1"]="More than three days had passed since the great battle. As the fog cleared, Mount Tianque quietly welcomed the late autumn.",
  ["100231201_10"]="Don't worry about that.",
  ["100231201_11"]="I've got it handled. No one's going hungry.",
  ["100231201_12"]="So, we are going to war? I'll go spread the word.",
  ["100231201_13"]="No need to rush. This isn't the right time for a fight.",
  ["100231201_14"]="Some of our people are still recovering from their injuries. They need rest.",
  ["100231201_15"]="My Lord.",
  ["100231201_16"]="Go ahead.",
  ["100231201_17"]="We've finished counting the weapons stockpile.",
  ["100231201_18"]="We still have enough arms to fight the Ji clan for a few times.",
  ["100231201_19"]="When do we strike?",
  ["100231201_2"]="After returning to his clan, Li Jun shut himself away in the forge for several days.",
  ["100231201_20"]="Not now. I'm focusing on forging a new sword.",
  ["100231201_21"]="My Lord, the Ji clan has already taken in several clans at the base of the mountain.",
  ["100231201_22"]="If we wait any longer, we could end up at a real disadvantage.",
  ["100231201_23"]="Plus, winter's coming. We need to start preparing food supplies.",
  ["100231201_24"]="Then what?",
  ["100231201_25"]="That's why I forged this sword, just in case.",
  ["100231201_26"]="If they come in peace, it'll be a gift. If not, it'll be their downfall.",
  ["100231201_27"]="Sounds fair, doesn't it?",
  ["100231201_28"]="My Lord, if the Ji clan really sends food... will you actually give them the sword?",
  ["100231201_29"]="We're not going to war, yet you say you have a plan, Lord of Weaponry... The grains are not going to fall from the sky, aren't they?",
  ["100231201_3"]="Clang. Clang. Clang.",
  ["100231201_30"]="Normally, by now, we'd have already stocked up for winter and be waiting for spring.",
  ["100231201_31"]="Curse those Ji invaders! Dragging this war into winter... How dishonorable!",
  ["100231201_32"]="Calling our foe dishonorable just because we're losing ground? That's not our way.",
  ["100231201_33"]="Besides, I've already made a pact with the chief of the Ji clan. He agreed to send us grain as a gesture of goodwill.",
  ["100231201_34"]="You're not planning to betray our alliance behind my back, are you?",
  ["100231201_35"]="No! Not at all!",
  ["100231201_36"]="We Tianli clan have always been honorable. Still, we need to see if the Ji clan can be trusted.",
  ["100231201_37"]="What if they use this as a chance to strike at us...",
  ["100231201_38"]="Li Jun let out a laugh.",
  ["100231201_39"]="The clan member observed the sword newly forged by Li Jun.",
  ["100231201_4"]="The sound of metal striking metal echoed like crashing waves, each blow landing in rhythmic succession, like a powerful, steady drumbeat.",
  ["100231201_40"]="The clan member spoke with growing urgency, but Li Jun simply waved him off, his determination unwavering.",
  ["100231201_41"]="But since their chief is offering an alliance and provisions, I don't see any reason to keep fighting.",
  ["100231201_42"]="I forged this sword with my own hands, but now its edge has dulled.",
  ["100231201_43"]="Leave it here. I'll have it melted down and reforged.",
  ["100231201_44"]="Right now? But... the Ji clan's camp is just at the foot of the mountain. I don't feel safe without a good weapon by my side.",
  ["100231201_45"]="Maybe we can reforge it after the war's over, my Lord?",
  ["100231201_46"]="Hahaha... with me here, they won't dare make a move. Leave the blade—and take my message to the clan.",
  ["100231201_47"]="Tell them life will carry on as usual. As for the Ji clan, I have my own plans to deal with them.",
  ["100231201_48"]="What happened after that?",
  ["100231201_49"]="According to legend... the sword gleamed like the sun. That moment marked the first time our clan shared a weapon with outsiders—a testament to Li Jun's integrity and honor.",
  ["100231201_5"]="The echoes of that legendary duel still seemed to linger in the air.",
  ["100231201_50"]="But in the end, the wicked Ji clan took advantage of his kindness... but that's a story for another time.",
  ["100231201_51"]="Anyway, our clan has always been known for our craftsmanship. That's why the patriarch trials are tied to it.",
  ["100231201_52"]="To honor Li Jun's legacy, every new patriarch must venture into the mountains, gather ore, and forge a blade.",
  ["100231201_53"]="The patriarch must pour their spirit into that sword, to show they're ready to lead Tianli toward a brighter future.",
  ["100231201_54"]="The blade's essence reflects the heart of its forger.",
  ["100231201_55"]="This is a crucial task, Li Chi. Treat it with utmost care.",
  ["100231201_56"]="Got it. So, I just need to forge a fine blade, right?",
  ["100231201_57"]="No! You need to forge a blade that matches the patriarch!",
  ["100231201_58"]="I see... so I need to search for ore and forge a blade, right? But what about the third trial?",
  ["100231201_59"]="Well, you'll know once you finish the first two trials.",
  ["100231201_6"]="Meanwhile, the northern winds intensified.",
  ["100231201_60"]="Well, that sounds easy as pie...",
  ["100231201_61"]="What do you mean by \"easy as pie\"?!",
  ["100231201_62"]="Oh, just you know...",
  ["100231201_63"]="I thought the trials would be more challenging.",
  ["100231201_64"]="I was expecting something like a ceremonial dance in QingYu City or a bear hunt in the mountains.",
  ["100231201_65"]="I didn't expect it to be just about forging a blade.",
  ["100231201_66"]="I'll be back in a bit.",
  ["100231201_67"]="What did you say? \"Just\" forging a blade?!",
  ["100231201_68"]="Ahem... you should really consider the importance of the ancestral decrees... Where are you, Li Chi?",
  ["100231201_69"]="Ahh, how can such an impatient child carry the weight of the patriarch?",
  ["100231201_7"]="Li Jun did not pause his hands.",
  ["100231201_70"]="We can't do that! Cerulean Crystals are our most precious resource! How can we just have them over?",
  ["100231201_71"]="Then maybe you should take this sword, fight the Ji clan yourself, and take the food from them?",
  ["100231201_72"]="Please... don't joke, my Lord.",
  ["100231201_73"]="I just... can't let this slide. Being stuck in the mountains like this—we've never suffered a setback this bad, have we?",
  ["100231201_74"]="If we hand over our Cerulean Crystals now, won't that be admitting defeat?",
  ["100231201_75"]="Every one of us is ready to fight the Ji clan to the very end!",
  ["100231201_76"]="Admitting defeat? What do you think is truly a \"defeat\" for us?",
  ["100231201_77"]="As long as even one of us is still standing, we're not defeated.",
  ["100231201_78"]="At first, I thought our unmatched weapons would help the clan thrive, secure more resources, and eventually thrive here.",
  ["100231201_79"]="But the war with the Ji clan has dragged on, and our losses have been mounting. This isn't what I had in mind.",
  ["100231201_8"]="With each swing of the hammer, the sword took shape, the strikes becoming more forceful and deliberate.",
  ["100231201_80"]="Is that why we're thinking about peace talks with the Ji Clan?",
  ["100231201_81"]="Peace talks? No, we never beg for peace.",
  ["100231201_82"]="The Lord of the Weaponry removed the blade from the clan member's waist, examining it closely.",
  ["100231201_83"]="The elder turns away, clearly annoyed by Li Chi's casual remark. By the time he turns back, Li Chi has already slipped away.",
  ["100231201_84"]="Forging the Blade",
  ["100231201_9"]="Silently, Li Jun focused on forging a green-tinged sword, a clear departure from his usual blade.",
  ["100231202_1"]="I have something important to report... I spotted some strange green snakes in the mountains. They don't seem like local species, and their scales rustle like metal.",
  ["100231202_10"]="Those snakes are unusually aggressive and hard to spot in the forest. If our people encounter them... I think we should put the trials on hold and focus on getting rid of these snakes.",
  ["100231202_11"]="Stay focused. A few snakes won't be a problem.",
  ["100231202_12"]="...",
  ["100231202_13"]="I see.",
  ["100231202_2"]="The heavy rain a few days ago caused a landslide there. Could these snakes be connected to the landslide?",
  ["100231202_3"]="Li Chi takes out a piece of snake scale, its crystallized surface catching the sunlight with a strange cerulean shimmer.",
  ["100231202_4"]="The Elder accepts the snake scale from Li Chi, examining it closely.",
  ["100231202_5"]="The edges appear finely cut, resembling polished metal more than the skin of any known creature.",
  ["100231202_6"]="Elder? Hey, elder?",
  ["100231202_7"]="Easy as pie, huh? Do you realize how long you've been out there? That's enough time for two mining trips!",
  ["100231202_70"]="Hold on.",
  ["100231202_71"]="Hmmm, I've never seen such snakes on this mountain before. I wonder where they came from?",
  ["100231202_72"]="If that's the case, I'll...",
  ["100231202_73"]="Not so fast. Tell me where you saw those snakes, and I'll have others handle them.",
  ["100231202_74"]="The rules are clear, and the trials must come first. Head to the forge and get ready for the second trial.",
  ["100231202_8"]="Enough with the excuses. Why not just say a green and white snake kidnapped you?",
  ["100231202_9"]="I'm serious!",
  ["100231301_1"]="How much time had passed since that battle?",
  ["100231301_10"]="Our strength lies in our weapons. What would we be without them?",
  ["100231301_11"]="Speaking of which, it's been a few days since I last saw His Lordship.",
  ["100231301_12"]="He's been busy forging a sword.",
  ["100231301_13"]="Forging a sword? But if we're not going to war anymore, why's he making a sword?",
  ["100231301_14"]="With force, the man plunged his blade into the ground, the tip sinking more than a foot deep into the soil.",
  ["100231301_15"]="It's meant to be a gift for the Ji clan.",
  ["100231301_16"]="Kinda surprising how invested His Lordship is in all this.",
  ["100231301_17"]="Still, we haven't even figured out where our winter food supply's coming from. Why is he so wrapped up with the Ji clan?",
  ["100231301_18"]="If we don't stock up before the snow seals off the mountains, we'll all starve.",
  ["100231301_19"]="Stock up… sure, but where are we even supposed to get food from?",
  ["100231301_2"]="In the crags, frost clung to the withered branches. Knots had formed in the ropes, creating a round shape.",
  ["100231301_20"]="All the clans we used to raid have already pledged loyalty to the Ji clan. Are you thinking of going against His Lordship's orders?",
  ["100231301_21"]="I'm saying we need to get through this winter, one way or another.",
  ["100231301_23"]="His Lordship has made his choice.",
  ["100231301_24"]="And his word is final.",
  ["100231301_25"]="...All we can do now is hope this winter's not too brutal.",
  ["100231301_26"]="I heard the Ji clan has people who write everything down... They keep records of the clan's tidings.",
  ["100231301_27"]="At this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if they end up writing, \"The Tianli clan was conquered by the Ji clan.\"",
  ["100231301_28"]="...",
  ["100231301_3"]="The geese that once soared over Mount Tianque had long migrated south, yet not a single bowstring had sung in days.",
  ["100231301_31"]="The ancient book slips from Li Chi's grasp, landing beside him, who has already dozed off without realizing when succumbed to sleep.",
  ["100231301_32"]="Hmm...",
  ["100231301_33"]="Rousing slowly, he gazes through the windowpane at the gray sky. Dusk is settling in.",
  ["100231301_34"]="The molten metal in the forge has taken shape. Carefully, he lifts it from the flames and quenches it in water. Steam rises in great clouds, filling the room with heat and mist.",
  ["100231301_35"]="Drawing a deep breath, he channels all his strength into his right arm, envisioning the blade's final form clearly in his mind.",
  ["100231301_36"]="The sharp, ringing clang of metal striking metal rings out once again.",
  ["100231301_37"]="With each strike, the blade's shape gradually evolves under the relentless hammering, its glowing red surface darkening as it cools.",
  ["100231301_38"]="Wasting no time, Li Chi swiftly returns the now-formed blade to the furnace.",
  ["100231301_39"]="Just a few more passes, and this blade will be done.",
  ["100231301_4"]="It was a peaceful, frigid winter.",
  ["100231301_40"]="What a hassle...",
  ["100231301_41"]="We could just order better weapons straight from QingYu City, but here we are, stuck forging them the old-fashioned way.",
  ["100231301_42"]="I wonder if some of these ancestral traditions even make sense anymore.",
  ["100231301_43"]="He picks up the book, brushing off the layer of ash that has settled on its pages.",
  ["100231301_44"]="Back then, Li Jun forged weapons to fight off wild beasts and secured the land for our people.",
  ["100231301_45"]="But now? Weapons are more like arts and crafts.",
  ["100231301_46"]="Once I become patriarch, I'm changing the rules.",
  ["100231301_47"]="So that the next guy won't have to waste time forging a blade like this.",
  ["100231301_48"]="I mean, who even uses a blade nowadays...",
  ["100231301_49"]="Oh right, those snakes I saw in the mountains the other day...",
  ["100231301_5"]="When was the last time we left Mount Tianque?",
  ["100231301_50"]="The elder said he'd send someone to handle it. Told me not to worry.",
  ["100231301_51"]="But why is the corridor so brightly lit?",
  ["100231301_52"]="The sound of hurried, restless footsteps approaches the door, suggesting an uneasy visitor.",
  ["100231301_53"]="More people got bitten by those snakes...?",
  ["100231301_54"]="Unfortunately, yes. Those snakes keep showing up out of nowhere, and the traps we set only seem to rile them up more.",
  ["100231301_55"]="We were hoping to find their nest and wipe them out all at once, but no luck despite our best efforts.",
  ["100231301_56"]="What's worse, some of us got bitten because they weren't watching their step.",
  ["100231301_57"]="You've got to be more careful!",
  ["100231301_58"]="You young ones... Has life in Mount Tianque made you too soft? You can't even handle a few snakes?",
  ["100231301_59"]="How did our clan end up raising such a helpless generation?",
  ["100231301_6"]="I can't quite remember.",
  ["100231301_60"]="Forget it... were the injuries serious?",
  ["100231301_61"]="No, those snakes don't seem to be venomous. They'll recover after a few days' rest.",
  ["100231301_62"]="But we're short on manpower as it is... Dealing with this snake problem won't be easy.",
  ["100231301_63"]="It's our sacred ground after all. We've got to do something no matter what.",
  ["100231301_64"]="Even if we can't find their nest, we can't let snakes keep roaming around unchecked.",
  ["100231301_65"]="If they reach this ancestral home, or even QingYu City... it'll cause quite a stir.",
  ["100231301_66"]="True, but we don't really have anyone skilled enough to deal with it.",
  ["100231301_67"]="I'll handle it.",
  ["100231301_68"]="Li Chi?",
  ["100231301_69"]="If I remember correctly, you're still in the middle of the trial.",
  ["100231301_7"]="A Tianli clansman wiped his blade clean and gave it a few swings through the air.",
  ["100231301_70"]="You haven't forgotten about the rules for the second trial, have you?",
  ["100231301_71"]="Even though our rules say the future patriarch mustn't leave the forge for three days, this issue needs urgent attention.",
  ["100231301_72"]="You know me well. I'll take care of those pesky snakes.",
  ["100231301_73"]="Wait.",
  ["100231301_74"]="\"Urgent attention\" isn't an excuse for skipping the trial.",
  ["100231301_75"]="I'm glad you care about the clan, but you can't have it both ways. If that's the case, you might have to wait for the next round of trials.",
  ["100231301_76"]="...",
  ["100231301_77"]="The whole clan is united right now. If I stick around in the forge just because of my trial, what will others think of me?",
  ["100231301_78"]="The trial is about earning respect from all our clan members.",
  ["100231301_79"]="If I don't stand up for them now, even if I become the patriarch, it won't mean anything.",
  ["100231301_8"]="His Lordship said we might not need these weapons again.",
  ["100231301_80"]="That's a call you'll have to make on your own.",
  ["100231301_81"]="Li Chi stands in silence, pausing at the doorway.",
  ["100231301_82"]="The elder no longer argues. He simply tucks his hands into his sleeves and steps back.",
  ["100231301_83"]="Despite the rhythmic hiss of the air bellows, Li Chi feels a growing urge to leave the forge.",
  ["100231301_84"]="I'm leaving, elder.",
  ["100231301_85"]="The elder, eyes closed, offers no response.",
  ["100231301_86"]="Severing the Serpent",
  ["100231301_9"]="I heard that too. Ever since the battle with the Ji clan, His Lordship has been different.",
  ["100231302_1"]="Li Chi drives his blade into a gap between the snake's scales, but it becomes lodged, making it hard to pull free.",
  ["100231302_10"]="Writhing in intense pain, the snake exposes its soft underbelly beneath the protective scales.",
  ["100231302_11"]="Without hesitation, Li Chi delivers a fatal blow.",
  ["100231302_13"]="Phew...",
  ["100231302_14"]="Li Chi!",
  ["100231302_15"]="Did that snake get you?!",
  ["100231302_16"]="Nah, it's just a snake... How about you?",
  ["100231302_17"]="Looks like... I'm still in one piece.",
  ["100231302_18"]="But seriously, why are you here, Li Chi?",
  ["100231302_19"]="Weren't you meant to be locked in the forge for three days straight?",
  ["100231302_2"]="Trembling from the pain, the snake coils, its tail clutched in its mouth.",
  ["100231302_20"]="Heh... I'm here because someone couldn't handle the snake, so I had to step in and save the day.",
  ["100231302_21"]="Well... this is...",
  ["100231302_22"]="His friend scratches his head awkwardly.",
  ["100231302_23"]="That was indeed a close one... but since you passed me that blade just in time, I'll let it slide.",
  ["100231302_24"]="Li Chi collapses to the ground, inspecting the blade in his hand.",
  ["100231302_25"]="The blade's edge is jagged, its shape distorted. It will need to be reforged from scratch.",
  ["100231302_26"]="This blade looks familiar. Where did you get it?",
  ["100231302_27"]="From the forge room...",
  ["100231302_28"]="...",
  ["100231302_29"]="Ahhh! What have you done?!",
  ["100231302_3"]="My blade!",
  ["100231302_31"]="Wait, do you mean... This blade was for the trial?!",
  ["100231302_32"]="Yeah.",
  ["100231302_33"]="I broke the rules by leaving the forge during the trial, and now I've wrecked the blade I forged.",
  ["100231302_34"]="Guess I'm just not cut out to be the patriarch... I should have made it clear to the elder from the start.",
  ["100231302_35"]="By the way, where's the elder?",
  ["100231302_36"]="I saw him heading into the inner room. He looked grim.",
  ["100231302_37"]="I must have let him down. He wanted me to step up as patriarch soon, but with everything like this...",
  ["100231302_38"]="Well, never mind. Let's hold off on the patriarch talk for now. It's a shame about the blade.",
  ["100231302_39"]="What do you mean, \"never mind\"?",
  ["100231302_4"]="Come back, Li Chi! It's too dangerous there!",
  ["100231302_40"]="The situation was urgent! The elder should take that into account!",
  ["100231302_41"]="Plus, you did a great job with those snakes! Everyone in the clan saw that.",
  ["100231302_42"]="Let's go! We'll talk to the elder together!",
  ["100231302_43"]="No need for that.",
  ["100231302_44"]="The ancestors must have thought of this scenario... If everyone breezes through the trials, what's the point of them?",
  ["100231302_45"]="There must've been others who couldn't craft a decent blade like me.",
  ["100231302_46"]="In that case, why fuss over the title anymore?",
  ["100231302_47"]="But seriously, you're a strange one, you know that?",
  ["100231302_48"]="Earlier, you were throwing sarcastic jabs at me.",
  ["100231302_49"]="And now you're all about supporting me for the patriarch role.",
  ["100231302_5"]="Pass me another blade!",
  ["100231302_50"]="But let me be clear: I won't forge a blade just for showing off.",
  ["100231302_51"]="The teenager gazes at Li Chi, a hint of awkwardness evident on his face.",
  ["100231302_52"]="Hey, come on... you're still on about that, huh?",
  ["100231302_53"]="It wasn't about pushing you away.",
  ["100231302_54"]="It's just that... respecting you as the future patriarch, according to the rules.",
  ["100231302_55"]="But we're buddies from way back... It's just annoying to have to suddenly bow down to you...",
  ["100231302_56"]="So that's the deal, huh?",
  ["100231302_57"]="Yeah, what else could it be?",
  ["100231302_58"]="...",
  ["100231302_59"]="Seriously, those rules are such a drag...",
  ["100231302_6"]="Here!",
  ["100231302_60"]="I should've dunked you in water to get your head straight.",
  ["100231302_61"]="Hold on, Li Chi! You're meant to be the future patriarch! What patriarch roughs up his own people?!",
  ["100231302_62"]="I've given up on being the patriarch!",
  ["100231302_63"]="And now, I just want to blow off some steam!",
  ["100231302_7"]="The snake, having recovered from the pain, recognizes Li Chi and slithers toward him with malice.",
  ["100231302_8"]="Li Chi deftly positions his blade to block attack. Steel clashes against fangs, and part of the snake's tooth shatters.",
  ["100231302_9"]="Hiss... Roaar...!",
  ["100231401_1"]="Looking down the mountain path, a dark mass of warriors moved like a swarm of ants.",
  ["100231401_10"]="Their chief came here alone last time, so it's only natural that I greet him personally this time.",
  ["100231401_100"]="Focusing solely on the blade and neglecting everything else is foolish! If you can't understand this, feel free to spend your days here as a smith!",
  ["100231401_101"]="But whatever you think, come and finish what must be done!",
  ["100231401_102"]="Realizing that he has no alternative, Li Chi reluctantly gathers his resolve.",
  ["100231401_103"]="So, what's the third trial about?",
  ["100231401_104"]="Searching for a blade.",
  ["100231401_105"]="Searching... for a blade?",
  ["100231401_106"]="Have you heard of Zhupi?",
  ["100231401_107"]="Of course I have. Zhupi, once belonged to our ancestor, Li Jun, who wielded it to rule. It's been passed down through generations, and the bearer of Zhupi gains the authority to lead the entire clan... Could it be the blade is missing from the clan?",
  ["100231401_108"]="The old man shakes his head.",
  ["100231401_109"]="Each leader places Zhupi in Lingyan Pavilion for the next successor to inherit.",
  ["100231401_11"]="Stay put. No one moves without my order.",
  ["100231401_110"]="This blade is the most treasured possession of our clan. I thought you'd retrieve it after all the trials...",
  ["100231401_111"]="Who would have expected such an unforeseen twist.",
  ["100231401_112"]="Anyway, just hurry there and keep that blade safe.",
  ["100231401_113"]="Why did you initially place that blade in Lingyan Pavilion if it's not secure at all...?",
  ["100231401_114"]="Oh, getting clever on me, huh? Trying to shed your patriarch title just like that?",
  ["100231401_115"]="No, no, just kidding... I'm out of here!",
  ["100231401_116"]="Seeking Zhupi",
  ["100231401_12"]="Yeah.",
  ["100231401_13"]="A hundred paces away, the opposing leader smiled and waved at the Tianli clan, showing no signs of hostility.",
  ["100231401_14"]="At that moment, a heavy snow began to fall.",
  ["100231401_15"]="It's been a while, Li Jun. How have you been doing?",
  ["100231401_16"]="Not too good.",
  ["100231401_17"]="Li Jun let out a quiet sigh, his voice carrying a sense of resignation.",
  ["100231401_18"]="You mentioned trading food with us, but you've brought quite the crowd this time.",
  ["100231401_19"]="If we hadn't made that deal and formed an alliance, we might be in the midst of a war right now.",
  ["100231401_2"]="It was the heart of winter, the air heavy with tension.",
  ["100231401_20"]="Yeah... I might've been a bit thoughtless about that.",
  ["100231401_21"]="I simply assumed a big clan like Tianli would need a hefty amount of food.",
  ["100231401_22"]="Maybe next time, I'll send envoys ahead to hash out the terms...",
  ["100231401_23"]="No need for that. We don't really care about formalities.",
  ["100231401_24"]="Though I must say, I'm pleasantly surprised you actually showed up as promised.",
  ["100231401_25"]="Li Jun's tone carried a hint of respect.",
  ["100231401_26"]="Most clans struggle this time of year, yet here you are with food to spare.",
  ["100231401_27"]="Heh, looks like I underestimated your might after all.",
  ["100231401_28"]="Haha, your sharp weapons definitely left an impression on us.",
  ["100231401_29"]="But like I mentioned earlier, we don't have to fight.",
  ["100231401_3"]="Amidst the chill, Tianli warriors readied their bows as usual, though their hands trembled from the chill.",
  ["100231401_30"]="We didn't come all this way to challenge your clan.",
  ["100231401_31"]="Instead, our aim is to show that we can bring stability and prosperity not just to my clan or yours, but to all clans in the vicinity.",
  ["100231401_32"]="Hmm... it's freezing out here. Let's head inside for a chat.",
  ["100231401_33"]="Follow me, you're our guests.",
  ["100231401_34"]="At Ji Xia's gesture, his people, carrying heavy bags, streamed into the Tianli camp from both sides.",
  ["100231401_35"]="Recalling something, Li Jun retrieved the green-hued sword from behind his back.",
  ["100231401_36"]="Turning the blade, he presented it to Ji Xia.",
  ["100231401_37"]="Here, the gift I promised you last time. Take it.",
  ["100231401_38"]="The Cerulean Crystal sword shimmered in the falling snow, its faint green glow standing out against the white landscape.",
  ["100231401_39"]="Ji Xia held the sword and began to dance, the blade's tip catching the drifting snowflakes.",
  ["100231401_4"]="The Ji clan has arrived, my Lord.",
  ["100231401_40"]="The gloomy sky sheds rain and snow. Promising harvests, bounty in tow.",
  ["100231401_41"]="The year ahead will be peaceful and abundant. A good year, indeed.",
  ["100231401_42"]="A good year? How can you be so certain when things look grim now?",
  ["100231401_43"]="More snow means fewer pests and healthier crops next year.",
  ["100231401_44"]="So, if it's a warm winter without snow, does that hint at a looming famine?",
  ["100231401_45"]="Not quite. No snow means favorable conditions for farming. So, even if pests emerge next year, there will still be a harvest.",
  ["100231401_46"]="...",
  ["100231401_47"]="Sacks of grain continued flowing into the Tianli camp. From above, Li Jun watched his people's reactions.",
  ["100231401_48"]="Not everyone reacted with delight to this generous gesture.",
  ["100231401_49"]="Ji Xia... What are your plans for next spring?",
  ["100231401_5"]="We're running low on arrows, so we might have to face them head-on.",
  ["100231401_50"]="Plans? What do you mean?",
  ["100231401_51"]="I'm talking about the future of the Ji clan and the Tianli clan, obviously.",
  ["100231401_52"]="As a leader, I must say your winter provisions for your clan are impressive.",
  ["100231401_53"]="If we could follow your ways, we wouldn't need to raid other clans or risk our lives hunting wild beasts in winter.",
  ["100231401_54"]="However, we've always been warriors. My people might still be skeptical, thinking this truce won't hold.",
  ["100231401_55"]="It'll take time for them to trust all of this.",
  ["100231401_56"]="I can reassure my people as long as I'm in charge, but I fear my successor might not fully grasp it.",
  ["100231401_57"]="Have you ever considered this?",
  ["100231401_58"]="When everyone is well-fed, conflicts will naturally diminish.",
  ["100231401_59"]="Even after we're gone, future generations will inherently protect their content, peaceful lives.",
  ["100231401_6"]="Get ready, but hold off on drawing your bows.",
  ["100231401_60"]="Do you really think so?",
  ["100231401_61"]="Ji Xia seemed genuinely surprised by Li Jun's concerns.",
  ["100231401_62"]="Why not? People hold on to their daily routines; it's only natural.",
  ["100231401_63"]="But no one can guarantee this for generations ahead.",
  ["100231401_64"]="Will our successors truly appreciate the importance of our alliance after decades?",
  ["100231401_65"]="Those who haven't been through battles themselves don't view blades as tools for survival like we do, but rather as tools for plundering.",
  ["100231401_66"]="Can you guarantee that your clan won't raise such greedy individuals in the future, Ji Xia?",
  ["100231401_67"]="That's... definitely a challenge.",
  ["100231401_68"]="After a moment of contemplation, Ji Xia broke into a smile.",
  ["100231401_69"]="But don't worry. We can record this and pass it down through the ages.",
  ["100231401_7"]="I'll deal with their chief myself.",
  ["100231401_70"]="Sounds like you have a solid plan, perhaps?",
  ["100231401_71"]="Hey, Cang Luo!",
  ["100231401_72"]="Cang Luo stood up from beside the growing mound of grain.",
  ["100231401_73"]="Yes, chief? I'm still tallying the grains we distributed this time.",
  ["100231401_74"]="You've got more turtle shells there, right? Let's introduce our ally to the power of the written word.",
  ["100231401_75"]="Similar to our pact, the words carved into these shells will endure for millennia.",
  ["100231401_76"]="Endure for millennia...",
  ["100231401_77"]="Then I should carefully consider the words I'll leave for future generations.",
  ["100231401_78"]="Ugh... this blade always feels like it's on the brink of breaking.",
  ["100231401_79"]="Li Chi examines the blade in his hand. With several quick flicks, the sword produces a series of dull, muted sounds.",
  ["100231401_8"]="My Lord?",
  ["100231401_80"]="This damaged blade will surely bring shame to my ancestors.",
  ["100231401_81"]="Brother Chi! What are you doing here?",
  ["100231401_82"]="Turning around, Li Chi sees the child who often follows him, watching him with curious eyes.",
  ["100231401_83"]="Nothing much. Just lamenting over this fine blade.",
  ["100231401_84"]="What brings you here? A kid like you shouldn't be wandering around the forge.",
  ["100231401_85"]="Oh, the elder sent me over.",
  ["100231401_86"]="He believes you're moping about and is summoning you for trials.",
  ["100231401_87"]="Trials? But aren't they done already?",
  ["100231401_88"]="I snuck out from the forge and forged a subpar blade, so technically, I didn't pass the second test, right?",
  ["100231401_89"]="Or does that old man want to scold me again?",
  ["100231401_9"]="Li Jun crossed his arms, resting the sword behind him.",
  ["100231401_90"]="Why are you still here? Do I need to personally escort you there?",
  ["100231401_91"]="...!",
  ["100231401_92"]="What brings you here, elder?",
  ["100231401_93"]="Finished sulking? If so, come and finish what you started.",
  ["100231401_94"]="But according to your teachings, our ancestral rules can't be bent, so I don't think I need to continue with the trials.",
  ["100231401_95"]="Because as the next patriarch, if I can't craft a decent blade, it'll be a joke for generations to come...",
  ["100231401_96"]="Enough of your arrogance, Li Chi!",
  ["100231401_97"]="At the elder's cough, Li Chi falls silent, setting the blade down.",
  ["100231401_98"]="You're still a teenager. Did you truly expect to forge an unmatched blade in just a few days?",
  ["100231401_99"]="The blade's essence reflects the heart of its forger. How many times must I repeat this?",
  ["100231402_1"]="It's strange. Why is the third trial about finding the blade in Lingyan Pavilion?",
  ["100231402_10"]="Li Chi unfolds the bamboo, revealing several lines of sharp, deliberate handwriting.",
  ["100231402_2"]="This seems too simple.",
  ["100231402_3"]="Could this be some kind of a bonus round, perhaps?",
  ["100231402_4"]="Hold on, the elder mentioned that the rules were set by Li Jun himself. There must be a deeper reason for sending his descendants here to find his blade.",
  ["100231402_5"]="I get mining and forging, but retrieving Zhupi feels completely out of place. This is quite perplexing.",
  ["100231402_6"]="Am I missing something here?",
  ["100231402_7"]="...",
  ["100231402_8"]="What's this?",
  ["100231402_9"]="Beneath the spot where Zhupi was placed, a small section of bamboo slips lies hidden.",
  ["100231501_1"]="White clouds drifted over the lofty pavilion, signaling the onset of another autumn. Li Jun found himself awakened inside the pavilion.",
  ["100231501_10"]="My Lord.",
  ["100231501_100"]="Li Chi presents the two blades to the elder.",
  ["100231501_101"]="What's this supposed to mean?",
  ["100231501_102"]="Well, I found the legendary blade Zhupi in Lingyan Pavilion, along with teachings from our ancestor.",
  ["100231501_103"]="Truth is, Zhupi never refers to a specific blade.",
  ["100231501_104"]="Instead, when a blade is wielded by the patriarch, it becomes Zhupi.",
  ["100231501_105"]="In other words, it symbolizes the patriarch's ultimate authority to make decisions for the clan.",
  ["100231501_106"]="So, you think the patriarch will be free from all constraints?",
  ["100231501_107"]="Li Chi shakes his head.",
  ["100231501_108"]="Quite the opposite. Being the patriarch is a constraint in itself.",
  ["100231501_109"]="When I was young and rebellious, I didn't fully grasp the importance of those rules.",
  ["100231501_11"]="My Lord?",
  ["100231501_110"]="And even now... it remains the same.",
  ["100231501_111"]="However, one thing I'm sure of is that those rules were created to safeguard our people.",
  ["100231501_112"]="And as the new patriarch, my only choice is to respect and follow them.",
  ["100231501_113"]="The elder's stern face reveals a rare hint of relief.",
  ["100231501_114"]="By offering up the blade you forged, you've shown your readiness to shoulder the responsibilities of being the patriarch.",
  ["100231501_115"]="Now, you deserve Zhupi.",
  ["100231501_116"]="You mean...",
  ["100231501_117"]="The patriarch embodies responsibility more than authority or power.",
  ["100231501_118"]="Only those who understand the weight of obligations will be fit to be patriarchs.",
  ["100231501_119"]="Reaching out, the elder retrieves the flawed blade forged by Li Chi, placing it reverently inside the temple hall.",
  ["100231501_12"]="Huh... Did I doze off?",
  ["100231501_120"]="You will be the new guardian of Lord Li Jun's blade.",
  ["100231501_121"]="Me?",
  ["100231501_122"]="The blade in this hall signifies the heir bearing the patriarch's mantle.",
  ["100231501_123"]="And the blade in your hand represents the descendant wielding Li Jun's authority.",
  ["100231501_124"]="While it's Lord Li Jun's blade, it's nothing more than a blade.",
  ["100231501_125"]="Then... Li Chi, all descendants of the Tianli clan, will obeys your command.",
  ["100231501_126"]="Yes, elder.",
  ["100231501_127"]="Now, the position of Tianli patriarch rests in your hands. Remember the vow you make today.",
  ["100231501_128"]="With Zhupi in your hand, you're no longer confined by clan rules. Instead, you become the rules for our clan.",
  ["100231501_129"]="I... I will live up to the trust you've placed in me.",
  ["100231501_13"]="You seem completely exhausted.",
  ["100231501_130"]="Stepping out with his new blade, Li Chi is greeted by clan members awaiting their patriarch.",
  ["100231501_131"]="Hey, patriarch! Share a few words with us, won't you?",
  ["100231501_132"]="Hmph... I don't have much to say... It was a straightforward ceremony, just that!",
  ["100231501_133"]="Patriarch! Let's get a glimpse of that legendary blade!",
  ["100231501_134"]="Well, it's just an ordinary blade... Feel free to take a look, but be careful not to cut yourselves.",
  ["100231501_135"]="The blade offered by Li Chi is accepted with reverence. The onlookers weigh it without pulling it out before passing it along.",
  ["100231501_136"]="Eventually, the blade, its sheathe vermilion like flowing silk, is returned to Li Chi's hands.",
  ["100231501_137"]="Each reception of the blade seems to have added to its weight.",
  ["100231501_138"]="Possibly because the blade not only symbolizes the patriarch's authority but also carries the expectations of all clan members.",
  ["100231501_139"]="At the moment, a tiny card flutters out from Li Chi's clothes.",
  ["100231501_14"]="No worries, it's just those scholars' repetitive talks that are giving me a headache. What's happening within the clan?",
  ["100231501_140"]="Redemp... tion... code? Hey, brother Chi! What's this all about?",
  ["100231501_141"]="Hey, Li Chi! Where did you get the money to buy this e-card? Didn't you mention they never gave you pocket money for video games?!",
  ["100231501_142"]="None of your business! I saved up secretly on my own!",
  ["100231501_143"]="...",
  ["100231501_144"]="Ahh... kids these days...",
  ["100231501_145"]="This guy never seems to mature.",
  ["100231501_146"]="Entrusting him with such a weighty responsibility might be a bit too early...",
  ["100231501_147"]="Past and Present",
  ["100231501_15"]="These are the revised rules of Tianli clan. If there is no issue, we'll implement them right away.",
  ["100231501_16"]="Li Jun lifted the bamboo scroll, which weighed heavily in his hand, without unfurling it, then smiled and tossed it aside.",
  ["100231501_17"]="Heh, these rules are no less tedious than reports from those scholary officials in court.",
  ["100231501_18"]="From a simple piece of turtle shell to these bamboo slips... at this rate, only a huge stele will be needed to engrave all our rules.",
  ["100231501_19"]="These rules were drafted based on our existing laws and cover every aspect that must be address.",
  ["100231501_2"]="How many years had passed since our parting below QingYu City?",
  ["100231501_20"]="What was that saying from the Ji clan again? \"Without rules...",
  ["100231501_21"]="...none can form square or circle.\", right?",
  ["100231501_22"]="I've been hearing it every single day. My ears are already ringing.",
  ["100231501_23"]="Li Jun casually picked up the slips and gave it a glance, letting out a heavy sigh.",
  ["100231501_24"]="Covering every aspect, huh? Clothing, food, transport, and shelter, and how to revering Heaven and honoring ancestors. Honestly, I wish you all would stop tormenting me with this ordeal.",
  ["100231501_25"]="And let's not burden our future generations with rules thousands of years from now either.",
  ["100231501_26"]="But if we don't pass down rules... what else should we leave as our legacy?",
  ["100231501_27"]="Li Jun shook his head.",
  ["100231501_28"]="How can the deceased monitor the actions of their descendants?",
  ["100231501_29"]="Forget the future generation, I doubt I can even manage myself a few years down the road.",
  ["100231501_3"]="While the \"Xia\" had just begun their journey, their founders had already caught a glimpse of the mandate of heaven.",
  ["100231501_30"]="The Cerulean Crystals were our closely held secret, and without the alliance with the Ji clan, the establishment of the Xia nation wouldn't be possible.",
  ["100231501_31"]="If we truly burden our descendants with such lengthy rules, I'll be the one bearing all the cursed from our future generation, you know?",
  ["100231501_32"]="If we cannot write rules, what could our clan code be...?",
  ["100231501_33"]="Li Jun offered no response.",
  ["100231501_34"]="The atmosphere grew tense, the long blade unsheathed, his eyes fixed on the blade with intense focus.",
  ["100231501_35"]="It was as if he was gazing towards his descendants millennia in the future.",
  ["100231501_36"]="Essence is key. If our descendants don't recognize the meaning behind our rules, those bamboo slips will only be good kindling.",
  ["100231501_37"]="A cold slash flickered, the bamboo slips snapped in response, leaving the Tianli member astonished.",
  ["100231501_38"]="Casually, Li Jun picked up several slips with the tip of his blade.",
  ["100231501_39"]="Let's make this the limit.",
  ["100231501_4"]="The hand wielding the blade is no longer felt free as it once was.",
  ["100231501_40"]="But these slips can't hold too many words.",
  ["100231501_41"]="That's natural, as I don't expect my descendants to surpass the Lord of Weaponry's achievements by following rules alone. I only trust in myself; that's how I became the patriarch.",
  ["100231501_42"]="If our future generations merely mimic the past without understanding the essence of the rules, like having a shell without a soul. In that case, I fear the Tianli clan will only walk the path of decline.",
  ["100231501_43"]="The future patriarchs need to grasp the spirit of our tribe, not follow the rules blindly.",
  ["100231501_44"]="So, what truly embodies the essence of our clan? And how should we infuse it into our rules? I need all of you to help figure this out.",
  ["100231501_45"]="Only those recognized by the entire clan would wield Zhupi.",
  ["100231501_46"]="The essence of Tianli, the very essence...",
  ["100231501_47"]="Where the bamboo slip split, the core was stained crimson.",
  ["100231501_48"]="Li Jun lowered Zhupi, returning his attention to the landscape, silent once more.",
  ["100231501_49"]="Li Chi grips the hilt, attempting to pull it out, but is momentarily halted by a touch of hesitation.",
  ["100231501_5"]="Perhaps I am tired... Had I foreseen the demanding nature of regency, I might have hesitated before taking on such a weighty responsibility.",
  ["100231501_50"]="Did that elder ask me to retrieve this blade simply because... it's important to our clan?",
  ["100231501_51"]="Li Jun was an exceptional patriarch, but why did he fixate on passing down a blade for generations?",
  ["100231501_52"]="Seated on the ground, he observes sunlight filtering through the window gap onto the sheath.",
  ["100231501_53"]="Placing the blade back in position, Li Chi exits through the door, gazing from atop Lingyan Pavilion towards the expansive view of Qian.",
  ["100231501_54"]="A jade-like stream cascades down the mountain, merging into a vast river on the horizon, glinting under the vast sky.",
  ["100231501_55"]="Beneath it all, the ancient walls of QingYu City are nestled in Mount Tianque like a stone pillar amidst rugged terrain.",
  ["100231501_56"]="I wonder what Li Jun saw when he stood here all those years ago?",
  ["100231501_57"]="In a surreal vision, QingYu City comes to life, intertwining with the spring's flow, spreading its roots downward across the vast mountain.",
  ["100231501_58"]="Nestled atop the mountain, the once isolated city has become steadfast and profound, enriched by the history of countless generations.",
  ["100231501_59"]="Is this why my clan has been staying here?",
  ["100231501_6"]="Nevertheless, the Tianli clan would surely uphold its commitments.",
  ["100231501_60"]="Li Chi is momentarily speechless.",
  ["100231501_61"]="Not bad, you've simplified things and kept it to just three... Excellent work.",
  ["100231501_62"]="Anything else you'd like to add, my Lord?",
  ["100231501_63"]="No, nothing more. Those who understand the true meaning can surely lead our clan.",
  ["100231501_64"]="However, if I were to add one more thing...",
  ["100231501_65"]="Let's be specific: \"The Tianli clan must never leave QingYu City.\"",
  ["100231501_66"]="Our clan must never leave the city?",
  ["100231501_67"]="But why? You might ask.",
  ["100231501_68"]="Well, let's call it a whim from your patriarch.",
  ["100231501_69"]="Anyway, I believe the beauty of QingYu City will benefit countless generations to come.",
  ["100231501_7"]="When my old friend returned, he would restore the country to its rightful glory.",
  ["100231501_70"]="Noted.",
  ["100231501_71"]="My wish is for the descendants of the Tianli clan to flourish here and carry our legacy forward through the ages.",
  ["100231501_72"]="Rising to his feet, Li Jun's gaze followed a white crane swiftly crossing the skies.",
  ["100231501_73"]="He might witness his friend's return, or he might never live to see that day.",
  ["100231501_75"]="Several years ago, outside QingYu City.",
  ["100231501_76"]="Well, guess it's about time to leave Mount Tianque.",
  ["100231501_77"]="When will you come back?",
  ["100231501_78"]="Heh, I've no idea.",
  ["100231501_79"]="Sometimes I wonder if those massive pillars supporting the sky, the endless dark ocean, or the river connecting the Milky Way truly exist.",
  ["100231501_8"]="But... would there be the day when we meet again?",
  ["100231501_80"]="And even if they do, reaching them would take ages.",
  ["100231501_81"]="Nevertheless, one day, I'll return to this city, sharing my adventures with you and all the people of Xia.",
  ["100231501_82"]="You're free to leave.",
  ["100231501_83"]="Anything specific you'd like me to witness on your behalf?",
  ["100231501_84"]="No worries. I'll head over and see it for myself once you're back.",
  ["100231501_85"]="Li Jun gestured, signaling for Ji Xia to depart.",
  ["100231501_86"]="As the sun set, Ji Xia broke a willow branch near Mount Tianque, offering it to Li Jun before heading towards the horizon.",
  ["100231501_87"]="Amused by the slender branch in hand, Li Jun chuckled.",
  ["100231501_88"]="Massive pillars supporting the sky, the endless dark ocean, and the river connecting the Milky Way...",
  ["100231501_89"]="Maybe you're the one who can truly grasp their immense beauty and connect with them.",
  ["100231501_9"]="...",
  ["100231501_90"]="Honestly, this gift is a bit too abstract for me to understand.",
  ["100231501_91"]="But that's okay.",
  ["100231501_92"]="My clan will continue to safeguard this city for generations to come.",
  ["100231501_93"]="I believe the future patriarch of my clan will be a talented youngster, just like you.",
  ["100231501_94"]="Standing in front of the Tianli ancestral temple, Li Chi takes a deep breath.",
  ["100231501_95"]="The well-worn blade in his hand bears signs of age, the sheath feeling rough against his palm.",
  ["100231501_96"]="Despite its age, the edge gleams like water, reflecting a pair of eyes observing him through millennia.",
  ["100231501_97"]="He opens the door and steps inside.",
  ["100231501_98"]="Have you brought back the blade, Li Chi?",
  ["100231501_99"]="Yes, I have.",
  ["1003010101_1"]="Hmm... this should do it. The water quality report of the Grandeur River has been sent to WeiShi.",
  ["1003010101_10"]="The Flame of Hephaestus... is still burning so brightly.",
  ["1003010101_100"]="Before she finishes her words, another clang fills the room.",
  ["1003010101_101"]="Clang...",
  ["1003010101_102"]="Oh, it's the bell. Caught me off guard.",
  ["1003010101_103"]="It's coming from the Astronomical Academy...",
  ["1003010101_104"]="From the window from Hephae's workshop, a tall, ancient-styled tower is visible in the distance, crowned by an observatory—the renowned Delphi Astronomical Academy.",
  ["1003010101_105"]="Is that... a funeral bell? What's going on? Who passed away?",
  ["1003010101_106"]="It's Professor Aratos from the Astronomical Academy.",
  ["1003010101_107"]="Professor Aratos was quite old. While you were away traveling for studies, her health declined, and sadly she didn't make it. Her obituary was shared last night.",
  ["1003010101_108"]="Seems like I've missed a lot lately...",
  ["1003010101_109"]="After all, you've been tirelessly working day and night, helping WeiShi decipher the mysteries of Cerulean Water.",
  ["1003010101_11"]="Legend says this eternal flame has been burning ceaselessly for a thousand years. Now, repurposed by experts from the Delphi Academy of Mechanics, it serves as a reactor supplying energy for the entire Academy Nation.",
  ["1003010101_110"]="I should head back. Dean Ariadne will need my support at a time like this.",
  ["1003010101_111"]="Go ahead, then.",
  ["1003010101_112"]="...You don't seem too concerned.",
  ["1003010101_113"]="When the fuel runs out, the fire naturally fades. Isn't that just the way life goes? Well, except for the Flame of Hephaestus!",
  ["1003010101_114"]="Delphi Society's Philosophy Academy, Philosophia District, Delphi City-State.",
  ["1003010101_115"]="The Dean's office is decorated in classical style: desk ornaments, sculptures in corners, and plaster busts on the windowsill, all antique in appearance.",
  ["1003010101_116"]="Even the stationery on the desk consists of parchment and quills.",
  ["1003010101_117"]="The wide desk is scattered with manuscripts and empty ink bottles, devoid of any modern electronics such as computers or keyboards.",
  ["1003010101_118"]="Apart from the manuscripts, the most prominent items on the table are various stimulants.",
  ["1003010101_119"]="Coffee, essential oils, energy drinks, peppermints, and even an object resembling a knitting needle are present. Given the absence of yarn, one can only speculate that it may be used for staying awake by applying pain to the thigh.",
  ["1003010101_12"]="Beneath the flame lies Delphi's Mechanicus District, home of the Mechanics Academy. In contrast to the dignified Philosophia District, the structures here are modern and striking, adorned with gleaming brass and iron.",
  ["1003010101_120"]="How long has it been since Dean Ariadne last slept? I know she has to stay awake to safeguard the Academy... but I can't help but worry about her well-being.",
  ["1003010101_121"]="The sound of the door opening interrupts Logos's murmuring as a brilliant golden figure steps into the room.",
  ["1003010101_122"]="You're back, Dean.",
  ["1003010101_123"]="Mmm, the funeral for Professor Aratos at the Astronomical Academy just ended.",
  ["1003010101_124"]="I'm truly sorry for the loss of Professor Aratos. I might not be well-versed in the affairs of the Astronomical Academy, but I do know she was a highly esteemed scholar.",
  ["1003010101_125"]="And a good person, thoughtful and kind. Elders like her are rare; I'll miss the black tea she used to brew.",
  ["1003010101_126"]="Ariadne reveals a warm smile.",
  ["1003010101_127"]="May I ask a question...? You seem regretful but not overtly mournful. Wasn't Professor Aratos your friend?",
  ["1003010101_128"]="You're part of the Philosophy Academy, my dear student. I believe you understand that the core of philosophy revolves around preparing for death.",
  ["1003010101_129"]="This practice brings us closer to the pure world of ideas.",
  ["1003010101_13"]="Logos strolls along the avenue linking the Philosophia and Mechanicus districts, receiving warm greetings from students.",
  ["1003010101_130"]="...I understand, but I find it hard to fully grasp or put it into practice myself.",
  ["1003010101_131"]="No need to be so serious. Let's talk about something more immediate.",
  ["1003010101_132"]="Have you sent the water test results of the Grandeur River to WeiShi?",
  ["1003010101_133"]="Yes, I have, and I was just about to report this to you—the situation in Qian looks dire.",
  ["1003010101_134"]="I spoke with Yuanquan. He assured me that things are still under control, and the Cerulean Water anomaly won't spread beyond Qian. Still, we should be ready to assist with anomaly analysis.",
  ["1003010101_135"]="If the central database still existed, Eme-an would have handled this responsibility. However, the Tower of Babel collapsed at this crucial moment, nearly wiping out the entire Eme-an overnight, leaving only a new Head Librarian and a single librarian...",
  ["1003010101_136"]="Sigh... I haven't had the chance to meet this new Head Librarian, but I've heard they've recently joined Eme-an. I wonder how that young one is coping with this mess. My heart goes out to them...",
  ["1003010101_137"]="The C.A.V.E. isn't a place for leisurely study. I hope the new Head Librarian can soon shoulder the burden.",
  ["1003010101_138"]="Cosmos has disappeared; Nemesis is back in full force; tensions are rising in Japheth out west. On top of that, Duke Cosimo Florentine and the Holy Cardinal passed away suddenly...",
  ["1003010101_139"]="The newly appointed Duchess Florence Florentine is just in her twenties, another young soul deserving of sympathy. Yet, she has no choice but to face the storm on the horizon...",
  ["1003010101_14"]="At that moment, a suspicious-looking student captures her attention.",
  ["1003010101_140"]="Ariadne flips through documents on the table as she speaks. Despite her clear and organized thoughts, the weariness etched on her face is apparent. A profound sense of drowsiness weighs heavily on her eyebrows, with her eyelids struggling to remain open.",
  ["1003010101_141"]="Are you alright?",
  ["1003010101_142"]="...I'm fine, don't worry about me. Anything else? Let's wrap this up.",
  ["1003010101_143"]="We've received an invitation from Bellefontaine's Buonarroti Museum. This year's charity banquet at the museum is on schedule, and they've asked us to send representatives.",
  ["1003010101_144"]="Have the Grand Scholar attend or ask him to find an art professor. Or you could go as well. I can't leave Delphi at such a sensitive time.",
  ["1003010101_145"]="You must be kidding, Grand Oracle. I'm just a student, and as you're aware, professors often say my playing is more like... mathematics than music.",
  ["1003010101_146"]="Regarding Cyril, KSOIR has sent their representatives to us, likely related to the turmoil in Japheth.",
  ["1003010101_147"]="The Military Academy has received a significant sum from them. Let them handle it.",
  ["1003010101_148"]="I'm afraid that won't work. Their representatives are from Division Zero.",
  ["1003010101_149"]="Well, then this is a C.A.V.E. level issue.",
  ["1003010101_15"]="...What's that in your hand?",
  ["1003010101_150"]="This is exactly what I was worried about. I suspect they're collaborating with us solely out of our long-standing relationship...",
  ["1003010101_151"]="Ariadne takes a sip from the cold coffee remaining in her cup.",
  ["1003010101_152"]="Never mind. The Academy Nation has always found itself caught between Japheth and Cyril, stuck in the strait that divides them.",
  ["1003010101_153"]="Now, we're being pressured again by those powerhouses, just as many times in history. Whether it's Bellefontaine or KSOIR, I'll find a way to handle them.",
  ["1003010101_154"]="Rubbing her temples, Ariadne murmurs to herself.",
  ["1003010101_155"]="These aren't big problems, just a bit annoying... But the real worry is Aratos...",
  ["1003010101_156"]="It's a shame. Aratos of this generation isn't ready yet.",
  ["1003010101_157"]="Logos is immediately intrigued by the unusual phrasing.",
  ["1003010101_158"]="Hmm? What do you mean by \"of this generation\"?",
  ["1003010101_159"]="Never mind. That's something I need to think about...",
  ["1003010101_16"]="N-nothing, just some... um, cleaning agent! Yeah!",
  ["1003010101_160"]="A resounding noise interrupts their conversation, shaking the entire building violently.",
  ["1003010101_161"]="An earthquake?!",
  ["1003010101_162"]="No...",
  ["1003010101_163"]="As if to confirm Ariadne's words, something slowly rises outside the window after the initial shaking.",
  ["1003010101_164"]="What... is that?",
  ["1003010101_165"]="Initially mistaking it for a newly formed mountain range due to geological shifts, Logos soon recognizes the rising structures from the city's core.",
  ["1003010101_166"]="These constructions were originally designed to reach skyward, comprising tall towers, expansive observation decks, and gleaming telescope enclosures.",
  ["1003010101_167"]="The Astronomical Academy?! The entire academy... in the sky?!",
  ["1003010101_168"]="What's happening, Dean?",
  ["1003010101_169"]="In contrast to Logos's shock, Ariadne's demeanor remains composed as if she has foreseen this.",
  ["1003010101_17"]="Hand it over.",
  ["1003010101_170"]="That? The only thing that could make today worse.",
  ["1003010101_171"]="Why still standing there, Logos? Time to go!",
  ["1003010101_172"]="Sound the alarm—this is an anomaly. Alert the entire Oracle and start emergency procedures!",
  ["1003010101_173"]="The Academy Nation stretches across the Strait of Ileptos, majestic buildings lining both shores. Among them, the Philosophia District stands out as the oldest and most refined, housing the prestigious Delphi Academy of Philosophy.&Looking down from the marble halls of the Philosophy Academy, one can see Delphi Harbor, where graceful white ships glide like seagulls on the azure waters.&Beyond the harbor, far across the city, a lighthouse-like spire rises into the clear sky, its peak ablaze with a brilliant flame that shines even in daylight.",
  ["1003010101_174"]="Academy Nation",
  ["1003010101_18"]="As you can see... cleaning this street is part of our rotation task anyway; there's no need to trouble you, Head Student!",
  ["1003010101_19"]="Stop fooling around.",
  ["1003010101_2"]="Never expected this anomaly could turn carbon-based lifeforms into metal-based ones.",
  ["1003010101_20"]="You're from the Chemistry Academy, aren't you?",
  ["1003010101_21"]="On March 19th, two years prior, you used unauthorized solvents to remove road stains, but ended up degrading the rubber tires of passing vehicles, causing a series of accidents.",
  ["1003010101_22"]="On June 25th previous year, your unauthorized air freshener experiment at the harbor triggered mass estrus among seagulls, who screamed day and night and severely disrupted residents' sleep.",
  ["1003010101_23"]="And on November 4th last year, you placed your \"innovative insect repellent\" mothballs in major hotels. By the next day, over 1,500 guests were complaining their clothes smelled like dog feces.",
  ["1003010101_24"]="Need I continue? Is the Chemistry Academy expecting another academy-wide disciplinary action?",
  ["1003010101_25"]="No, no, Head Student... here, please take it!",
  ["1003010101_26"]="The uneasy student presents Logos with a small bottle.",
  ["1003010101_27"]="No label, as I suspected. Which wise guy bypassed academy approval this time?",
  ["1003010101_28"]="What were you planning to do with it?",
  ["1003010101_29"]="It's our turn to maintain the city's statues this month. We intended to clean the statue of Pallas, the Goddess of Wisdom, in the Philosophia District...",
  ["1003010101_3"]="Alright, next—oh, I wonder how the thing I asked Hephae about is going.",
  ["1003010101_30"]="The statue of Pallas? Clean it?",
  ["1003010101_31"]="Logos pours out the liquid onto the ground.",
  ["1003010101_32"]="Initially clear, the liquid swiftly transforms into a shiny silver coating.",
  ["1003010101_33"]="Another absurd idea.",
  ["1003010101_34"]="You planned to coat the statue to keep the dirt off for good, didn't you? Did you skip the artifact preservation chapter in your introductory course?",
  ["1003010101_35"]="No, no, Head Student! This is just the first cleaning agent. We have several more! Mixed together, they'll make sure the final coating matches the marble's original color perfectly, not a hint of difference!",
  ["1003010101_36"]="Enough. Give me your name and student ID. You'll face internal disciplinary action from the Chemistry Academy. Head to your academy's administrative office and get the form yourself. Also, inform all personnel on rotation this month to clean the statues properly using sponges and water-based cleansers. Any failures upon inspection at month's end will double the penalties.",
  ["1003010101_37"]="And, clean this coating off the ground yourself.",
  ["1003010101_38"]="...Understood.",
  ["1003010101_39"]="Pallas Square, the heart of the Philosophia District, serves as the essential route leading to the Mechanicus District. Here, the ancient statue of Pallas, the Goddess of Wisdom, stands tall.",
  ["1003010101_4"]="The term \"Delphi\" contains three meanings.&It represents an academy, a city, and a nation.&The Scholar City-State, and a utopia of knowledge—that's how people describe Delphi.",
  ["1003010101_40"]="According to legend, it has stood here since ancient times, even bearing witness to the founding of the Delphi Society long ago.",
  ["1003010101_41"]="After enduring millennia of exposure, the goddess's features have blurred, yet she continues to welcome generations of students entering the halls of philosophy.",
  ["1003010101_42"]="Logos herself once received this welcome.",
  ["1003010101_43"]="...Thankfully, managed to stop those Chemistry Academy troublemakers.",
  ["1003010101_44"]="While waiting at a crossroad for the traffic signal, Logos casually browses the academic forum on her phone.",
  ["1003010101_45"]="Today's so lucky! Just ran into our Head of Student right after stepping out.",
  ["1003010101_46"]="Yo buddy, take a selfie smiling with a peace sign, then I'll believe you're truly \"lucky.\"",
  ["1003010101_47"]="Dude, don't jinx me, please?",
  ["1003010101_48"]="You haven't said what happened after meeting the Head of Student.",
  ["1003010101_49"]="She stopped me and asked for my name and student ID, insisted on giving me extra evaluation credits. Happy now?",
  ["1003010101_50"]="Wow, seems like you got plenty of credits. Sending you $50, mind sharing a little?",
  ["1003010101_51"]="A frown creases Logos's brow.",
  ["1003010101_52"]="User \"BenzeneDream\" fabricated facts. Granting evaluation credits requires academy approval. The Head of Student has no such authority, nor have I ever granted evaluation credits to anyone. This user has violated the regulations of the Delphi online forum \"Altar of Truth.\" To stop any negative impact, their account is hereby suspended for one month.",
  ["1003010101_53"]="User \"IndustrialBanana\" attempted to purchase evaluation credits, a serious breach of academic regulations. To deter others from doing the same, their account is hereby suspended for six months, and their academy has been notified internally.",
  ["1003010101_54"]="All Delphi students, I kindly urge you to consider this as a reminder to be mindful of your actions and behavior.",
  ["1003010101_55"]="...[Sweat] Head Student sure is working hard.",
  ["1003010101_56"]="Having a Head of Student like you is truly a blessing for all of Delphi!",
  ["1003010101_57"]="Well deserved. [Thumbs Up][Thumbs Up][Thumbs Up]",
  ["1003010101_58"]="I can already see better days coming.",
  ["1003010101_59"]="Thank you all for supporting my work as Head Student. I'll keep it in mind and do my utmost to build a better environment within the forum for every student.",
  ["1003010101_60"]="Delphi Society's Mechanics Academy, Mechanicus District, Delphi City-State.",
  ["1003010101_61"]="The towering silhouette, crowned with the Flame of Hephaestus, casts its shadow over half of Mechanicus.",
  ["1003010101_62"]="Stepping into the tower, Logos swiftly finds the workshop of the \"Flame Guardian.\"",
  ["1003010101_63"]="However, instead of the usual clangs, an unfamiliar humming fills the workshop.",
  ["1003010101_64"]="I'm coming in, Hephae.",
  ["1003010101_65"]="Ugh... Forgive me, Flame of Hephaestus...",
  ["1003010101_66"]="Hephae...?",
  ["1003010101_67"]="Startled by Logos's approach, the petite figure at the forge turns around sharply, hastily hiding her hands behind her back.",
  ["1003010101_68"]="What were you doing, Hephae?",
  ["1003010101_69"]="N-nothing! Just some... routine cleaning, you know!",
  ["1003010101_70"]="Hephae nervously averts her gaze.",
  ["1003010101_71"]="...What kind of cleaning needs air freshener? Indoor barbecue?",
  ["1003010101_72"]="Huh? How did you find that out? Did you smell the barbecue?",
  ["1003010101_73"]="Hephae takes a deep sniff, realizing too late that she has given herself away.",
  ["1003010101_74"]="Ahaha... I-I can explain that... It's related to my research on miniaturizing the Flame of Hephaestus...",
  ["1003010101_75"]="I knew it...",
  ["1003010101_76"]="You're not the first person today who's tried to deceive me.",
  ["1003010101_77"]="Deceive? That's a bit too harsh! I just... haven't had the chance to fully explain everything yet...",
  ["1003010101_78"]="Using the Flame of Hephaestus for grilling is traditionally impolite—it disrespects the God of Craftsmen and the spirit of forging he embodies.",
  ["1003010101_79"]="Confronted by Logos's serious expression, Hephae's voice fades into a murmur.",
  ["1003010101_80"]="Alright, alright, my bad... I shouldn't have done that... I've cleaned up thoroughly, guaranteeing no traces were left...",
  ["1003010101_81"]="I just sampled it a bit... Even the Flame of Hephaestus can be used practically for cooking... Stop giving me that look, I've already apologized to the Flame... Ugh...",
  ["1003010101_82"]="That's understandable, and you've made amends. I'll file a report to the Mechanics Academy truthfully detailing this incident and issue a warning. I hope you'll correct this.",
  ["1003010101_83"]="Ugh... understood, My Lady.",
  ["1003010101_84"]="Hephae, I've told you not to call me that. \"My Lady\" is a feudal-era term that doesn't fit a scholarly, enlightened Academy Nation like ours.",
  ["1003010101_85"]="Yeah, you're as humorous as ever—a real stone.",
  ["1003010101_86"]="Your praise is quite unique... I've never heard it before, but thank you nonetheless.",
  ["1003010101_87"]="...Ugh, forget it.",
  ["1003010101_88"]="You're here for \"Urania,\" right? I've finished its maintenance. It's on that table over there.",
  ["1003010101_89"]="But don't touch my tools, especially the hammer.",
  ["1003010101_90"]="Your hammer is massive, I probably can't even lift it. Why do you always stress this every time I visit?",
  ["1003010101_91"]="It's not about the size! Don't touch the smaller ones either!",
  ["1003010101_92"]="Alright, I'll respect the Flame Guardian's wishes.",
  ["1003010101_93"]="Heh Heh, that's more like it! I've filled out the maintenance form as usual. Just submit it, and the Mechanics Academy will sort things out with the Philosophy Academy by month's end.",
  ["1003010101_94"]="Logos picks up the lyre-sword \"Urania\" from Hephae's workbench. The sword's tip gleams sharp and bright, its lyre strings meticulously tuned.",
  ["1003010101_95"]="Excellent craftsmanship as always. Thanks, Hephae.",
  ["1003010101_96"]="Of course! Nobody at Delphi Mechanics Academy can beat me in this field. My work always guarantees quality!",
  ["1003010101_97"]="Logos gently plucks a string. However, instead of the expected melodious notes, a loud clang resonates.",
  ["1003010101_98"]="Clang...",
  ["1003010101_99"]="Huh?! What just happened? Did the string break?",
  ["1003010201_1"]="Like an anthill scooped out from its center, a giant hole emerges in the heart of the Academy Nation, drawing citizens toward it like ants converging on a disturbance.",
  ["1003010201_10"]="All we know is that Phaenomena was last seen near the end of Professor Aratos's funeral.",
  ["1003010201_11"]="The Astronomical Academy is ascending as we speak. We can't waste time puzzling over an empty chair.",
  ["1003010201_12"]="But this is about the Astronomical Academy...",
  ["1003010201_13"]="No, Tetractys is right. We can't keep waiting like this.",
  ["1003010201_14"]="Ariadne stands up and walks to the center of the hall.",
  ["1003010201_15"]="Even the dean who previously challenged her now withdraws the hostility, joining the other deans in anticipation of her decision.",
  ["1003010201_16"]="The situation is dire. Due to unknown reasons, the laws of gravity within the Astronomical Academy have been nullified. The entire academy, carrying thousands of teachers, students, and tourists, is ascending straight into the atmosphere.",
  ["1003010201_17"]="To make matters worse, Dean Phaenomena vanished precisely at this critical moment. We must unite and deal with this crisis together.",
  ["1003010201_18"]="The first response to her plea is a steady, mechanical voice.",
  ["1003010201_19"]="Canopus is here, always ready to answer your call.",
  ["1003010201_2"]="Above this hole, the Astronomical Academy—with its vast, ancient, and elegant architecture—is drifting skyward, as if its brass and marble structures have broken free from gravity's grasp.",
  ["1003010201_20"]="According to the War Act, we've conscripted every eligible student, deploying them to strategic points throughout the Academy Nation to help evacuate civilians and restore order.",
  ["1003010201_21"]="Strategic points? No wonder the Grand Scholar contacted me earlier, saying that Japheth and Cyril both warned about Delphi's mobile forces near the Strait of Ileptos.",
  ["1003010201_22"]="Such large-scale troop movements might lead to undesirable misunderstandings from our neighbors.",
  ["1003010201_23"]="Mechanicus is also taking action.",
  ["1003010201_24"]="I just received an update. With our latest rotary-wing transport devices, Master Hephae and the students have landed on the Astronomical Academy and started rescue operations.",
  ["1003010201_25"]="Good, Daedalia. Besides rescuing people, there's another pressing matter.",
  ["1003010201_26"]="A whole castle soaring into the sky isn't something we can brush off as a simple \"experimental mishap,\" especially with so many eyes on us.",
  ["1003010201_27"]="Although humanity's collective subconscious tends to blur out irrational situations, today is an open visit day—there are so many tourists inside and outside the Academy. No matter how much the subconscious blurs things, some memories will definitely remain...",
  ["1003010201_28"]="N-no need to worry about that. Economia students have already informed all C.A.V.E members. They'll help us with \"cover-ups,\" fixing any images captured by international satellites.",
  ["1003010201_29"]="But we're powerless when it comes to dealing with the media and tourists...",
  ["1003010201_3"]="A rocket launch would be sufficient to capture attention, let alone an entire city ascending.",
  ["1003010201_30"]="Media? What's there to worry about? Even Clarion Media relies on Mathematica's algorithms. Trust me, those reports will never reach public eyes.",
  ["1003010201_31"]="As for the tourists dropping from the sky, our Pharmakon's medical teams will have it covered.",
  ["1003010201_32"]="Mental suggestions, hypnosis, medication... we've got plenty of ways to wipe those unpleasant memories for those poor souls.",
  ["1003010201_33"]="...",
  ["1003010201_34"]="There's much in your approaches still open to discussion. Under normal circumstances, I'd gladly go over them with you.",
  ["1003010201_35"]="But given the critical situation we're in, I won't say more.",
  ["1003010201_36"]="Swiftly, Ariadne pierces herself with a silver needle, a sharp pain coursing through her nerves.",
  ["1003010201_37"]="Now, let's move on to our final topic.",
  ["1003010201_38"]="At this point, we need to decide how to deal with the Astronomical Academy.",
  ["1003010201_39"]="Deal with? But I thought we were going to rescue everyone inside the academy? At this rate, we should manage just fine.",
  ["1003010201_4"]="Fear and chaos grip the clamorous crowd as the academy rises, threatening to engulf the entire city-state.",
  ["1003010201_40"]="The academy's ascent isn't slowing down. As it gains altitude, rescue efficiency will decline exponentially.",
  ["1003010201_41"]="You know this better than I do, Daedalia. Once it passes the stratospheric threshold, even Mechanicus's rotor-wing devices won't help.",
  ["1003010201_42"]="But...",
  ["1003010201_43"]="Absolutely, Grand Oracle. This is why we must make the most of the academy while we still can.",
  ["1003010201_44"]="The woman seated at the Medical Academy's chair rises, smiling.",
  ["1003010201_45"]="The situation is tough now, but think about it differently—hasn't the Astronomical Academy now broken free of gravity's hold and solved the energy problem for space travel?",
  ["1003010201_46"]="We simply need to convert the academy into a sealed, extraterrestrial biosphere before it leaves the atmosphere, then it will turn into a spacecraft for colonization.",
  ["1003010201_47"]="Technology won't be a problem. Our extraterrestrial ecology is already well-developed. We just need to—",
  ["1003010201_48"]="This is nonsense! The culprit is still inside the academy. Do you think they'll just sit back and watch your plan unfold?",
  ["1003010201_49"]="Oh? Hoplite—do you have a lead on who's behind this already?",
  ["1003010201_5"]="Despite the turmoil outside, the marble hall remains undisturbed.",
  ["1003010201_50"]="I'll just be straight with you, Grand Oracle. No one but Nemesis could pull off something on this scale.",
  ["1003010201_51"]="This isn't some accident or incident—this is war! Nemesis destroyed Eme-an and the Tower of Babel, and now they're reaching for the Academy Nation!",
  ["1003010201_52"]="The Military Academy proposes mobilizing all ground forces immediately to obliterate the Astronomical Academy before it exits the atmosphere, eliminating this threat at its core.",
  ["1003010201_53"]="How barbaric, crude, and primitive.",
  ["1003010201_54"]="Only those dim-witted Japhethians from two thousand years before the World Calendar would propose such a method. If we must bring down the Astronomical Academy, I have a far better solution.",
  ["1003010201_55"]="Stop! Have you all forgotten that the Astronomical Academy is a part of Delphi's assets?",
  ["1003010201_56"]="The radio telescopes in the teaching building, the astronomical instruments on the main platform, and the gravitational-wave observatory that just made headlines a few days ago...",
  ["1003010201_57"]="Destroy the academy, and we'll lose them all!",
  ["1003010201_58"]="Do you realize the enormity of this write-off? Even if we slashed all Delphi professors' salaries in half, we couldn't cover this financial abyss!",
  ["1003010201_59"]="Raising funds and resolving deficits—isn't that precisely why your Finance Academy exists?",
  ["1003010201_6"]="Apart from the Astronomical Academy, the other six Deans of the Academy Nation have gathered, each assessing the unfolding disaster in their own manner.",
  ["1003010201_60"]="If you can't even settle a small sum like this, maybe we should just auction off the Finance Academy for scrap and call it even.",
  ["1003010201_61"]="Tetractys... you—you math-obsessed lunatic! All you see are numbers and equations! You have no idea how difficult our tasks are!",
  ["1003010201_62"]="...Enough.",
  ["1003010201_63"]="Ariadne pauses briefly, her voice weary but unquestionably authoritative.",
  ["1003010201_64"]="At this rate, even if the Astronomical Academy leaves the solar system, you'd still be arguing here without resolution.",
  ["1003010201_65"]="Let me handle this myself, as I always do.",
  ["1003010201_66"]="Just continue with your duties as you reported earlier.",
  ["1003010201_67"]="As for the Astronomical Academy—I'll head there in person.",
  ["1003010201_68"]="Ariadne rises, intending to leave.",
  ["1003010201_69"]="However, Daedalia hurries after her, tugging at her clothing.",
  ["1003010201_7"]="Some wear concerned expressions, some are deep in thought, and others... have already started fidgeting with their fingers.",
  ["1003010201_70"]="Sister Ariadne, while checking the evacuation lists, my students found someone was overlooked and is still unaccounted for.",
  ["1003010201_71"]="Ariadne leans toward her slightly.",
  ["1003010201_72"]="Oh? Who is that?",
  ["1003010201_73"]="Daedalia tiptoes, whispering a name into Ariadne's ear.",
  ["1003010201_74"]="...",
  ["1003010201_75"]="I see... this situation might be a bit more serious than I initially evaluated.",
  ["1003010201_76"]="Military Academy",
  ["1003010201_77"]="Mechanics Academy",
  ["1003010201_78"]="Finance Academy",
  ["1003010201_79"]="Mathematics Academy",
  ["1003010201_8"]="Sister Ariadne, still no news about Dean Phaenomena?",
  ["1003010201_80"]="Medical Academy",
  ["1003010201_81"]="Crisis Meeting",
  ["1003010201_9"]="Not yet. Members still at the Astronomical Academy have checked all surveillance footage and asked every student near her, but there's no sign of Phaenomena.",
  ["1003010301_1"]="…Daedalia's makeshift rotor-wing devices truly are remarkable.",
  ["1003010301_10"]="Hephae nods.",
  ["1003010301_11"]="Good. Get everyone out of here immediately.",
  ["1003010301_12"]="As for the rest… Logos.",
  ["1003010301_13"]="Ariadne turns to her student as if a sudden realization dawns upon her.",
  ["1003010301_14"]="Are you carrying your lyre with you?",
  ["1003010301_15"]="You mean \"Urania\"? It's right here—I had it maintained by Hephae recently and just got it back.",
  ["1003010301_16"]="I see... then perhaps you'll indeed be useful.",
  ["1003010301_17"]="Come with me. But be warned—this is dangerous. I'll resort to my final measure if I have to.",
  ["1003010301_18"]="You don't mean...",
  ["1003010301_19"]="Ariadne yawns lazily.",
  ["1003010301_2"]="It's amazing how smoothly and precisely it takes off and lands.",
  ["1003010301_20"]="It's true I haven't had a proper rest since long ago. A short nap shouldn't hurt too much.",
  ["1003010301_21"]="But—your sleep is connected to the Labyrinth of Reverie!",
  ["1003010301_22"]="Yes, but do we have another choice? If it comes down to it, I'll have to sleep, activating the Labyrinth of Reverie to envelop the entire Astronomical Academy.",
  ["1003010301_23"]="If the Academy leaves the solar system, then it's a lost cause. Trapping it in the Labyrinth of Reverie would be a better option. Besides, it wouldn't be the first time I've made it out of that maze.",
  ["1003010301_24"]="Logos attempts to voice a protest, but remains silent eventually, seemingly resolved.",
  ["1003010301_25"]="I'll do my best to prevent the situation from coming to that.",
  ["1003010301_26"]="Then let's move. Remember Hephae's warning—we don't have much time. As the Astronomical Academy climbs, the air will thin, and breathing will soon become difficult.",
  ["1003010301_28"]="Astronomical Academy",
  ["1003010301_3"]="Logos, are you alright?",
  ["1003010301_4"]="I-I'm fine, Dean, just a little dizzy at such heights...",
  ["1003010301_5"]="It's you, Grand Oracle! And you too, Logos! Finally, you've arrived!",
  ["1003010301_6"]="Time's short, so here's the situation: the Astronomical Academy is picking up speed. If it keeps going like this, it'll exit the atmosphere in three hours, heading straight for the Oort Cloud at the edge of the solar system.",
  ["1003010301_7"]="Now the Astronomical Academy is truly living up to its name. If we don't stop it, it'll soon be cruising among the stars!",
  ["1003010301_8"]="Let's hope it doesn't come to that.",
  ["1003010301_9"]="Have the teachers, students, and visitors all been rescued?",
  ["1003010302_1"]="The academy-city, visible earlier, has vanished beneath cloud, leaving the Astronomical Academy akin to an isolated island in the sky.",
  ["1003010302_2"]="At this altitude, even rotor-wing devices would struggle to land safely… Our communications with the ground are cut off, too.",
  ["1003010302_3"]="Stay focused, Logos. No time to waste.",
  ["1003010402_1"]="This is where we separate ways, Logos. You're on your own from now on.",
  ["1003010402_10"]="If I spilled all the details now, we'd be suffocated from lack of oxygen before I could finish.",
  ["1003010402_11"]="Just go. I have a hunch she's somewhere around here in the academy.",
  ["1003010402_12"]="What should I do once I find her?",
  ["1003010402_13"]="You'll decide what you should do, my dear student.",
  ["1003010402_14"]="Relax, everything will be fine. Just think of this as a special \"assignment\" from me as your mentor, not as the Grand Oracle.",
  ["1003010402_2"]="Where are you going?",
  ["1003010402_3"]="The situation is dire. I must get to the highest point of the academy now. Once the academy approaches the edge of the atmosphere, I'll enter sleep, allowing the Labyrinth of Reverie to descend and envelop the entire academy.",
  ["1003010402_4"]="As for you, I need you to find someone.",
  ["1003010402_5"]="She's definitely not on the ground; otherwise, Daedalia would've let me know.",
  ["1003010402_6"]="So, I believe she's somewhere inside the academy.",
  ["1003010402_7"]="Who is she?",
  ["1003010402_8"]="Hmm… all I say is she's a girl with fiery red hair, about your age.",
  ["1003010402_9"]="Who is she? And why do you need me to find her now? Can she actually help us out?",
  ["1003010502_1"]="Aratos…?",
  ["1003010502_2"]="There are still twenty seconds left! Keep counting, don't turn around yet—I haven't found a hiding spot!",
  ["1003010502_3"]="The image disappears.",
  ["1003010502_4"]="Wait, was that Dean Phaenomena… and Professor Aratos as a young girl?",
  ["1003010502_5"]="That memory must've been from many years ago. To think Professor Aratos was once such a little girl... but Dean Phaenomena hasn't changed at all.",
  ["1003010502_6"]="I'd heard that Dean Phaenomena wasn't exactly ordinary, but... could it be that she herself is an anomaly?",
  ["1003010502_7"]="Also, if Professor Aratos knew Dean Phaenomena from childhood, why does it seem like Dean Phaenomena didn't really mourn Aratos at the funeral...?",
  ["1003010502_8"]="Is it my imagination… or did Dean Phaenomena seem a bit awkward in the image just now?",
  ["1003010601_10"]="Do you know how to sing a lullaby, Aratos?",
  ["1003010601_100"]="Aratos, face, dirty.",
  ["1003010601_101"]="Aratos stared at what was on Phaenomena's fingertip for a long moment, finally realizing it was a small piece of avian waste.",
  ["1003010601_102"]="Upon this hilarious realization, Aratos burst into laughter.",
  ["1003010601_103"]="Geez! No wonder Goddess Pallas told me to check my reflection in the pond after the interview.",
  ["1003010601_104"]="Speaking of Goddess Pallas, Phaenomena, you've got to hear about today's interview...",
  ["1003010601_105"]="Recounting the day's events, Aratos accompanied Phaenomena back to the pavilion.",
  ["1003010601_106"]="Honestly, the interview was just all candidates standing beside the Altar of Truth, taking turns approaching, and Goddess Pallas would ask the same question—",
  ["1003010601_107"]="I am the Goddess of Omniscience. I can answer any question for you, but at the cost of your life. What would you choose to do?",
  ["1003010601_108"]="Aratos, answer, life?",
  ["1003010601_109"]="Phaenomena murmured the keywords, her head slightly tilted.",
  ["1003010601_11"]="This was their first encounter.",
  ["1003010601_110"]="I actually had my response all planned out, but darn it... probably because I stayed up all night counting stars with you, when I faced Goddess Pallas, my mind went blank and I ended up asking...",
  ["1003010601_111"]="Exalted Goddess Pallas, Phaenomena's hair has been dropping star fragments. Yesterday, one got stuck in my star chart, making it impossible for me to stargaze these days.",
  ["1003010601_112"]="Hair...",
  ["1003010601_113"]="When tied into a ponytail, fragments leak from the ends; when braided, they escape through the gaps... I wonder what hairstyle could possibly contain the universe hidden in her hair?",
  ["1003010601_114"]="Goddess Pallas stayed silent for a long moment before finally replying: \"Oh, my dear girl, head to the Astronomical Academy. You'll find your answers there.\"",
  ["1003010601_115"]="Well, I knew Goddess Pallas's question was just a ritual to assign students to different academies, but I really couldn't help myself. How could going to the Astronomical Academy possibly bring me answers about hairstyles?",
  ["1003010601_116"]="So, I couldn't help but ask another question, even though it violated Goddess Pallas's rule about answering only one question.",
  ["1003010601_117"]="And guess what Goddess Pallas said?",
  ["1003010601_118"]="\"Oh, you silly thing. I meant there's a bunch of astronomy nerds at the Astronomical Academy who are really into stargazing. Maybe you could sweet-talk one of them into sharing a spare star chart with you!\"",
  ["1003010601_119"]="\"You know? I think your wit is unbearably slow. You don't have to rush off to the Astronomical Academy just yet. Why not slot yourself into the 'Undetermined Studies' group for now and think over what you really want to do?\"",
  ["1003010601_12"]="Phaenomena—",
  ["1003010601_120"]="You know, after that encounter... my illusions about Goddess Pallas have completely shattered.",
  ["1003010601_121"]="Enough talking for now, let's have some honey cake, Phaenomena. You've been standing all day, you must be hungry.",
  ["1003010601_122"]="Night descended again.",
  ["1003010601_123"]="Phaenomena remained immobile, gazing skyward at the stars like a statue.",
  ["1003010601_124"]="Aratos stretched and let out a yawn.",
  ["1003010601_125"]="Ah, so sleepy... but the stars are really stunning tonight.",
  ["1003010601_126"]="Why do you like stars so much, Phaenomena?",
  ["1003010601_127"]="You're slow and clumsy at everything, yet only when looking at stars do you seem interested. Look, what's that constellation over there?",
  ["1003010601_128"]="Aries.",
  ["1003010601_129"]="How about this one?",
  ["1003010601_13"]="...",
  ["1003010601_130"]="Orion.",
  ["1003010601_131"]="And that one?",
  ["1003010601_132"]="Carina.",
  ["1003010601_133"]="Tsk, can't stump you. This is not fun at all.",
  ["1003010601_134"]="Maybe I should talk to the Grand Scholar about getting you enrolled. If you were to join the academy, I'm sure they'd place you in the Astronomical Academy.",
  ["1003010601_135"]="Sometimes I wonder... perhaps you are a star yourself, just like the ones shining in the sky.",
  ["1003010601_136"]="Do you know where your home is, Phaenomena?",
  ["1003010601_137"]="Home?",
  ["1003010601_138"]="Phaenomena widened her eyes, gazing at the starry expanse for a moment before slowly shaking her head.",
  ["1003010601_139"]="As I thought. Are you hearing that \"noise\" again tonight?",
  ["1003010601_14"]="Don't try to ignore me! The Grand Scholar told me to style your hair every day.",
  ["1003010601_140"]="Phaenomena slowly nodded.",
  ["1003010601_141"]="This is weird. All the best doctors in Delphi say your ears are perfectly fine, so where exactly does this \"noise\" come from?",
  ["1003010601_142"]="Once more, Phaenomena directed her gaze towards the starry sky.",
  ["1003010601_143"]="Aratos followed her gaze upwards.",
  ["1003010601_144"]="Could the noise you hear be coming from up there?",
  ["1003010601_145"]="Phaenomena nodded, then shook her head, gesturing towards the ground beneath her.",
  ["1003010601_146"]="Ah, sometimes I struggle to figure out what you're trying to tell me. But then again, if the noise really comes from up there...",
  ["1003010601_147"]="Then perhaps your home is calling you back, my little star.",
  ["1003010601_148"]="Phaenomena stared at Aratos blankly, repeating the word softly to herself once more.",
  ["1003010601_149"]="...Home.",
  ["1003010601_15"]="Come here, sit here in front of me. Your hair is so long, and this is quite a task. The Grand Scholar really should give me some extra pocket money for this…",
  ["1003010601_150"]="Alright, alright. Don't overthink it, my little star. Come here, rest on my lap.",
  ["1003010601_151"]="Let me put you to sleep, my little star. Seriously, I'm far from good at singing... why do you enjoy my singing so much?",
  ["1003010601_152"]="Another year passed.",
  ["1003010601_153"]="Aratos.",
  ["1003010601_154"]="Stars.",
  ["1003010601_155"]="Not today, Phaenomena.",
  ["1003010601_156"]="I'm exhausted. Just trying to apply for a course, but why do I have to dash around between so many offices...",
  ["1003010601_157"]="Here, take this. It's a tuning fork I bought today.",
  ["1003010601_158"]="You seem to be quite fond of this, right? It's not exactly a \"meal allowance\" purchase by the Grand Scholar's rules, but I bought it anyway. The store had a buy-one-get-one-free offer... I mean, it's all just shiny Aurei—does it really matter what I spend it on?",
  ["1003010601_159"]="Hmm? How to use it...",
  ["1003010601_16"]="Within Phaenomena's soft, flowing hair, tiny granules of shimmering light scattered gently, like grains of sand.",
  ["1003010601_160"]="Haha, this gal is so tense she's speaking her mind. Seems like you really like it.",
  ["1003010601_161"]="Here, strike it like this... Lovely sound, isn't it?",
  ["1003010601_162"]="When Aratos struck the first tuning fork, Phaenomena's pupils abruptly contracted.",
  ["1003010601_163"]="The other one... Give me.",
  ["1003010601_164"]="Phaenomena uncharacteristically took the initiative to speak.",
  ["1003010601_165"]="She struck one tuning fork, then brought it close to the other.",
  ["1003010601_166"]="The two tuning forks resonated harmoniously.",
  ["1003010601_167"]="Phaenomena focused intently on the paired tuning forks in her hands, and gradually, a rare smile appeared on her face.",
  ["1003010601_168"]="Wow! Amazing, Phaenomena! You're truly a genius!",
  ["1003010601_169"]="Exactly, that's the way to go. You play around a bit while I go find some professors for those recommendation letters...",
  ["1003010601_17"]="But when Aratos reached out to catch them, her palm remained empty.",
  ["1003010601_170"]="Late at night, Aratos awoke from her sleep in a daze.",
  ["1003010601_171"]="Phaenomena?",
  ["1003010601_172"]="Stars.",
  ["1003010601_173"]="Wait, you've been playing with those forks until now? Let me see... Oh my, it's already past midnight.",
  ["1003010601_174"]="Let's just go to sleep, okay?",
  ["1003010601_175"]="...",
  ["1003010601_176"]="Stars.",
  ["1003010601_177"]="Yeah, yeah, you're the best little star. Let's go to sleep now.",
  ["1003010601_178"]="I want... to see stars.",
  ["1003010601_179"]="Ah... why are you always so stubborn at times like these?",
  ["1003010601_18"]="Your hair is so beautiful… I've never seen hair this lovely before.",
  ["1003010601_180"]="Once more, they went to the pavilion.",
  ["1003010601_181"]="The grass was adorned with tiny white daisies.",
  ["1003010601_182"]="Phaenomena gazed at the starry sky, and Aratos looked at Phaenomena.",
  ["1003010601_183"]="I've made up my mind, Phaenomena.",
  ["1003010601_184"]="I've talked to the Grand Scholar. I want to join the Astronomical Academy and major in astronomy... I want to become an astronomer.",
  ["1003010601_185"]="Astronomer?",
  ["1003010601_186"]="It's someone who specializes in studying the stars and the universe. Sounds interesting, right?",
  ["1003010601_187"]="Why?",
  ["1003010601_188"]="Hmm, you're asking why?",
  ["1003010601_189"]="I'm at an age where I have to decide my future. Plus, I need a job, otherwise who's going to treat you to those yummy cakes?",
  ["1003010601_19"]="Be careful, don't let those stars fall out of your hair.",
  ["1003010601_190"]="Not this.",
  ["1003010601_191"]="Astronomy... why?",
  ["1003010601_192"]="You mean, why did I choose astronomy?",
  ["1003010601_193"]="Facing Phaenomena's curious gaze, Aratos gave a slightly bashful smile.",
  ["1003010601_194"]="Do you remember the question Goddess Pallas asked at my enrollment ceremony?",
  ["1003010601_195"]="From the moment I first laid eyes on you, I've always thought you were the most beautiful and radiant being I've ever seen.",
  ["1003010601_196"]="Even the Grand Scholar told me that you fell from the sky into the Nereus Sea... So, where exactly are you from?",
  ["1003010601_197"]="I want to know why you're uniquely connected to the stars.",
  ["1003010601_198"]="And I also want to know, if your home truly lies among the stars, where exactly is that?",
  ["1003010601_199"]="Perhaps someday, we'll find a way to... send you home.",
  ["1003010601_2"]="Aratos.",
  ["1003010601_20"]="The Grand Scholar said you're from another world… Could it be that you're actually a star that fell from the sky?",
  ["1003010601_200"]="Alright, it's getting late. We should call it a night.",
  ["1003010601_201"]="Are you still hearing that strange noise?",
  ["1003010601_202"]="Yes...",
  ["1003010601_203"]="Then I'll sing you a lullaby again tonight.",
  ["1003010601_204"]="...",
  ["1003010601_205"]="Soon, a gentle melody echoed through the night sky.",
  ["1003010601_206"]="Watching Phaenomena gradually drift into a dreamy slumber, Aratos briefly halted her singing.",
  ["1003010601_207"]="Phaenomena... if I'm no longer here one day, who will sing you lullabies then?",
  ["1003010601_208"]="So, Phaenomena, where exactly do you come from?",
  ["1003010601_209"]="Perhaps catching Aratos's whispered words, the half-dozing Phaenomena raised her hand, gently brushing it against Aratos's lips.",
  ["1003010601_21"]="And why is your hair blue? Can you tell me? I wish I could have blue hair, too!",
  ["1003010601_210"]="Abruptly, the girl raises her head.",
  ["1003010601_211"]="Like a figure in a painting suddenly becoming aware of the world beyond its frame, she gazes intently towards the \"outside\" of the painting.",
  ["1003010601_212"]="Her eyes shed their original colors, revealing hues as magnificent as the night sky.",
  ["1003010601_213"]="Hmm? Who's there?",
  ["1003010601_214"]="...",
  ["1003010601_215"]="You shouldn't exist within this \"ripple.\" Who are you?",
  ["1003010601_216"]="I...",
  ["1003010601_217"]="Yeah, who am I?",
  ["1003010601_218"]="Why can I observe their stories as if peering into a painting?",
  ["1003010601_219"]="I mean no harm.",
  ["1003010601_22"]="Phaenomena, previously unresponsive, appeared touched by Aratos's words. Slowly, she raised her head to look meet Aratos's gaze.",
  ["1003010601_220"]="The girl falls silent briefly, her tone softening.",
  ["1003010601_221"]="Okay, I believe you. I'll just consider you a stone accidentally caught in this \"ripple.\"",
  ["1003010601_222"]="You seem to be facing some trouble. I'm sorry, but I'm merely a ripple. I can't solve your problems.",
  ["1003010601_223"]="Please stay quiet for now and don't make any noise.",
  ["1003010601_224"]="I've finally managed to lull my little star to sleep. Let her rest peacefully, at least for now.",
  ["1003010601_225"]="Now, I'll continue singing for her. If you don't mind, please listen for a while... before you recall everything...",
  ["1003010601_226"]="The Moon",
  ["1003010601_229"]="I thought about it… If there ever comes a day when there's an answer I'd risk my life to figure out, I think… it would be you.",
  ["1003010601_23"]="Then, for the first time since their meeting, she spoke.",
  ["1003010601_24"]="Red.",
  ["1003010601_25"]="Oh, yeah, my hair is red… W-wait, you can speak?!",
  ["1003010601_26"]="Aratos pointed at Phaenomena.",
  ["1003010601_27"]="You, Phaenomena, blue.",
  ["1003010601_28"]="Imitating Aratos, Phaenomena also extended her finger.",
  ["1003010601_29"]="Aratos, red.",
  ["1003010601_3"]="This little one is called Phaenomena. You'll be living together from now on. Take good care of her.",
  ["1003010601_30"]="Yes, yes! So you aren't a little dumb after all!",
  ["1003010601_31"]="I'll write this down in my diary and report to the Grand Scholar later!",
  ["1003010601_32"]="Late at night, Aratos awoke.",
  ["1003010601_33"]="...",
  ["1003010601_34"]="Beside Aratos's bed, Phaenomena sat alone, baked in moonlight filtering through the window, her hands tightly covering her ears.",
  ["1003010601_35"]="...Oh my star, what's going on with you?",
  ["1003010601_36"]="Ugh…",
  ["1003010601_37"]="You've been awake for six whole days! Ever since you came to stay with me, you've been staring at the stars every single night!",
  ["1003010601_38"]="Noisy…",
  ["1003010601_39"]="Is my snoring disturbing you at night...?",
  ["1003010601_4"]="Yes, Your Excellency.",
  ["1003010601_40"]="Phaenomena shook her head, looking out of the window.",
  ["1003010601_41"]="Noisy…",
  ["1003010601_42"]="Aratos tilted her head, attempting to catch any sound but heard nothing.",
  ["1003010601_43"]="But there's no noise at all...",
  ["1003010601_44"]="Firmly gripping Phaenomena's shoulders, Aratos compelled her to face directly.",
  ["1003010601_45"]="Don't tease me like this, Phaenomena. It's not funny at all.",
  ["1003010601_46"]="Phaenomena looked at Aratos with eyes as innocent and moist as those of a little deer.",
  ["1003010601_47"]="...",
  ["1003010601_48"]="Alright, you're a little dumb who can barely speak—how could I suspect you of lying? That's far too difficult for you.",
  ["1003010601_49"]="Noisy... too noisy...",
  ["1003010601_5"]="The red-haired girl widened her eyes, staring at the girl taller than herself.",
  ["1003010601_50"]="Wow, you've even learned adverbs—that's quite impressive! It must be a super loud noise only you can hear.",
  ["1003010601_51"]="After a moment's consideration, Phaenomena blinked and nodded decisively.",
  ["1003010601_52"]="Resting her hands on her hips, Aratos's tone grew increasingly serious.",
  ["1003010601_53"]="A noise that's kept my little star awake for a whole week—that's truly unforgivable.",
  ["1003010601_54"]="Let me think of a way to fix this huge problem... Hmm...",
  ["1003010601_55"]="Suddenly, she recalled the Grand Scholar's advice.",
  ["1003010601_56"]="Oh, and one more thing. Do you know how to sing a lullaby, Aratos?",
  ["1003010601_57"]="Oh right, how could I forget that?",
  ["1003010601_58"]="Come here, Phaenomena. Lie down on my lap—I have a great trick to chase away that noise.",
  ["1003010601_59"]="Just don't complain about how bad my singing is, okay?",
  ["1003010601_6"]="Hey there, Phaenomena! I'm Aratos!",
  ["1003010601_60"]="Time flowed by.",
  ["1003010601_61"]="In the early morning, the red-haired girl awoke to the gentle chirping of birds.",
  ["1003010601_62"]="As her eyelids fluttered open, a bird took flight from her face, leaving behind a tiny scratch on her nose.",
  ["1003010601_63"]="The mild sting prompted the red-haired girl to sit up with a frown.",
  ["1003010601_64"]="Soft grass cushioned her, and the warm sun beamed overhead.",
  ["1003010601_65"]="Squinting, she scrutinized the sun's position, her expression evolving from confusion to alarm.",
  ["1003010601_66"]="Hastily turning around, she anxiously shook the figure nestled beside her.",
  ["1003010601_67"]="Wake up! Hey! Wake up now, Phaenomena! I'll be late for my interview!",
  ["1003010601_68"]="The figure roused by the red-haired girl was a taller blue-haired young woman.",
  ["1003010601_69"]="Slowly, Phaenomena opened her eyes, her starry hair shimmering with a violet hue in the morning mist.",
  ["1003010601_7"]="...",
  ["1003010601_70"]="She extended her hand, capturing a drifting dandelion puff that suddenly froze mid-air, as if suspended by imperceptible threads.",
  ["1003010601_71"]="Come on! Stop playing with the dandelions! We overslept!",
  ["1003010601_72"]="Aratos swiftly pulled Phaenomena up, then quickly yet methodically ran her fingers through Phaenomena's hair, carefully brushing away the dandelion fluff from its tips.",
  ["1003010601_73"]="Swiftly yet gently, she then braided the starlight-scattered hair into tidy plaits.",
  ["1003010601_74"]="It was as if this action had been engraved into her instincts.",
  ["1003010601_75"]="Nevertheless, a distressed expression lingered on her face,.",
  ["1003010601_76"]="What rotten luck! Why did a meteor shower have to happen the night right before my entrance exam?",
  ["1003010601_77"]="Ah, this is ridiculous! Why did I have to spend the whole night counting stars with you?",
  ["1003010601_78"]="I'm done for! If I waste more time, by the wise Goddess Pallas, I'll surely be rejected by the Delphi Society!",
  ["1003010601_79"]="With a vacant expression, Phaenomena stared downward at the red-haired girl who barely reached her chest.",
  ["1003010601_8"]="Phaenomena… is a bit different from other children. You'll need to have some patience with her.",
  ["1003010601_80"]="Abruptly, as if noticing something, she reached toward Aratos's face.",
  ["1003010601_81"]="However, Aratos had already shifted her gaze elsewhere.",
  ["1003010601_82"]="Forget it, anyway, you seem to have slept well last night. That's good news!",
  ["1003010601_83"]="I must go now! If you're hungry, just head home. I've bought you some honey cake, wrapped in paper on the dining table.",
  ["1003010601_84"]="Got it? You got it, right?! I'm off!",
  ["1003010601_85"]="The red-haired girl darted away like a crimson whirlwind, quickly slipping through Phaenomena's fingertips.",
  ["1003010601_86"]="In moments, her figure dwindled to a small red speck amidst the distant greenery, her voice faintly audible in the breeze.",
  ["1003010601_87"]="Heavens help me! I've got to pass Goddess Pallas's interview no matter what!",
  ["1003010601_88"]="Phaenomena stood alone on the lawn, slowly lowering her hand after a long while.",
  ["1003010601_89"]="Aratos, face...",
  ["1003010601_9"]="Oh, and one more thing—",
  ["1003010601_90"]="At dusk, Aratos hastened back to the pavilion.",
  ["1003010601_91"]="Like a startled rabbit, she anxiously peeked through bushes and flowers, searching for something.",
  ["1003010601_92"]="Phaenomena... Phaenomena... Ah, by Goddess Pallas, where on earth are you?! What should I do? I've lost Phaenomena again!",
  ["1003010601_93"]="Upon noticing Phaenomena still standing at the same spot, Aratos's anxiety gave way to surprise.",
  ["1003010601_94"]="Rushing over, she embraced Phaenomena tightly, as if cherishing a precious treasure, her voice quivering with emotion.",
  ["1003010601_95"]="Ohhh.... why are you still here? How long have you been standing? I was scared out of my wits, Phaenomena! I thought I'd lost you. Didn't I tell you to go home?",
  ["1003010601_96"]="Within her tearful words resonated both reproach and self-blame.",
  ["1003010601_97"]="Only when Aratos stood steadfastly before her did Phaenomena gradually respond.",
  ["1003010601_98"]="She reached out, her fingertips gently grazing Aratos's face, wiping something off.",
  ["1003010601_99"]="This was a gesture she had intended to do since morning, finally completed at dusk.",
  ["1003010702_1"]="One thing is certain: these projections show how Dean Phaenomena predicted the existence of Uranus and Neptune.",
  ["1003010702_2"]="...But something feels off. If only I could reach the Astronomical Academy students right now.",
  ["1003010702_3"]="Even though I can't pin down the exact dates, I'm pretty sure those two planets were discovered at least a century ago.",
  ["1003010702_4"]="Even if we forget about Dean Phaenomena, in those projections, Professor Aratos seems to be only in her early twenties. Could Professor Aratos have actually lived for over a century?",
  ["1003010702_5"]="The Medical Academy's life-extension technology wasn't being used practically back then... No, even now, that would raise some serious ethical questions.",
  ["1003010702_6"]="Ah, Logos, you really should've gathered knowledge more consistently. Then, in critical moments like this, you'd be able to make rational judgments—just like Dean Ariadne.",
  ["1003010702_7"]="Dean Ariadne's \"assignment\" is turning out to be more complex than I imagined.",
  ["1003010801_10"]="Haha, Phaenomena, my life isn't as brilliant as yours; it's rather boring.",
  ["1003010801_100"]="The excitement on Aratos's face gradually waned.",
  ["1003010801_101"]="This has moved beyond just an academic issue; it cannot be resolved within the academy. Do you understand, Scholar Aratos?",
  ["1003010801_102"]="Yes... I do, Grand Oracle.",
  ["1003010801_103"]="Good.",
  ["1003010801_104"]="We mustn't allow the mundane world to know that... that there's someone in our society who knows all the universe's mysteries.",
  ["1003010801_105"]="I've issued orders at the Delphic Oracle level. All relevant records and papers must be revised, and both Florentine and Eme-an will help manage public perception.",
  ["1003010801_106"]="I understand, and I'll handle it. However, I have two requests, Grand Oracle.",
  ["1003010801_107"]="Go ahead.",
  ["1003010801_108"]="First, I'd like to work alongside Phaenomena from now on. Please invite her to the Delphi Society officially.",
  ["1003010801_109"]="Haha, interesting indeed. Do you really want an assistant who can barely take care of herself?",
  ["1003010801_11"]="Aratos's hands resumed their task of combing through Phaenomena's hair.",
  ["1003010801_110"]="When it comes to astronomy, it's hard to say who's actually the assistant.",
  ["1003010801_111"]="I have a feeling that compared to my \"research,\" what Phaenomena does is closer to simply \"narrating.\" The discovery of those two new planets in the solar system—it's like that information has always been in her mind, and she just spoke it out.",
  ["1003010801_112"]="...",
  ["1003010801_113"]="Well, since you know Phaenomena best, I'll grant your request.",
  ["1003010801_114"]="But with one condition: like in this case, any future \"discoveries\" by Phaenomena must be concealed and revised accordingly.",
  ["1003010801_115"]="Now, state your second request.",
  ["1003010801_116"]="Phaenomena herself doesn't care about these matters, but I believe she deserves some compensation.",
  ["1003010801_117"]="I propose appointing Phaenomena as the Dean of the Astronomical Academy.",
  ["1003010801_118"]="And your reasons...?",
  ["1003010801_119"]="Phaenomena is more connected to the stars than any of us.",
  ["1003010801_12"]="In my world, I have to deal with many things that bring nervousness, fear, and discomfort, all to earn something called \"money.\"",
  ["1003010801_120"]="In the presence of a living star, what qualification do humans have to claim the title Dean of the Astronomical Academy?",
  ["1003010801_121"]="The Grand Oracle paused for a moment, then laughed heartily.",
  ["1003010801_122"]="You have a point...but I hope our Dean of the Astronomical Academy at Delphi can at least meet basic human standards of self-care and communication.",
  ["1003010801_123"]="Chewing on planetary models like candies during academic seminars simply won't cut it.",
  ["1003010801_124"]="You'll need to give her more lessons on human customs, Scholar Aratos.",
  ["1003010801_125"]="Aratos smiled in response.",
  ["1003010801_126"]="Alright, I'll take that as a \"yes\"! Talking sense into Phaenomena might take a long time, but once it's done, remember the promise you made today!",
  ["1003010801_127"]="Night fell.",
  ["1003010801_128"]="Phaenomena sat on the grass, her knees drawn up, gazing upward at the stars.",
  ["1003010801_129"]="A red-haired girl appeared behind her.",
  ["1003010801_13"]="But you... you belong to a different world, a more distant and beautiful one.",
  ["1003010801_130"]="As I thought, you're here, Phaenomena.",
  ["1003010801_131"]="It's not a great night for stargazing. Let's head home now?",
  ["1003010801_132"]="...",
  ["1003010801_133"]="Alright, I see. Eat something, then. I've brought you...",
  ["1003010801_134"]="Honey cake.",
  ["1003010801_135"]="Ha, nothing escapes your nose... but before you dive into the cake, I need an answer from you.",
  ["1003010801_136"]="Phaenomena stared at Aratos with deer-like eyes, evidently unsure why Aratos was being unusually challenging.",
  ["1003010801_137"]="Because that's what it told me.",
  ["1003010801_138"]="Haha, so you're saying that the star can talk?",
  ["1003010801_139"]="Phaenomena shook her head in response.",
  ["1003010801_14"]="A lovely fishtail braid took form, neatly capturing all the shining stars within it.",
  ["1003010801_140"]="...No, it can't talk yet.",
  ["1003010801_141"]="She paused, thinking over the question.",
  ["1003010801_142"]="Or perhaps, it's just that I can't understand yet.",
  ["1003010801_143"]="But the sound came from there, and nothing will change its orbit.",
  ["1003010801_144"]="Aratos placed her hands on her hips.",
  ["1003010801_145"]="So, is there any sound from the stars that you do understand?",
  ["1003010801_146"]="Phaenomena pondered for a moment before reaching out and gently touching Aratos's lips.",
  ["1003010801_147"]="From deep within the stars, there's your singing. It's beautiful.",
  ["1003010801_148"]="Aratos chuckled softly.",
  ["1003010801_149"]="You always say the silliest things. I'm right here, not up in the stars.",
  ["1003010801_15"]="I don't understand what you mean.",
  ["1003010801_150"]="...So, can I have it now? The honey cake.",
  ["1003010801_151"]="Yeah, sure, my little star.",
  ["1003010801_152"]="Phaenomena quickly finished the cake before nestling into Aratos's embrace.",
  ["1003010801_153"]="Aratos's sweet voice began to resonate. Before she realized it, she found herself able to sing this ancient lullaby beautifully.",
  ["1003010801_154"]="Enveloped in the soothing melody, Phaenomena licked her fingertips, savoring the last remnants of sweetness, and gradually closed her eyes.",
  ["1003010801_155"]="Observing Phaenomena deeply asleep, Aratos tenderly combed through her hair, withdrew a well-worn diary from her bag, and began jotting something down.",
  ["1003010801_156"]="Suddenly, she closes the diary and lifts her head, her eyes once more shimmering with starlight.",
  ["1003010801_157"]="You've come again, my unexpected guest.",
  ["1003010801_158"]="...Who are you?",
  ["1003010801_159"]="Now, you're asking me a question... How extraordinary.",
  ["1003010801_16"]="But I want to help you.",
  ["1003010801_160"]="You're not Aratos.",
  ["1003010801_161"]="No, I'm not, yet I am.",
  ["1003010801_162"]="I'm merely the lingering resonance after a melody... a ripple carrying information.",
  ["1003010801_163"]="Besides Phaenomena, no one else can hear my voice, but you seem to be an exception.",
  ["1003010801_164"]="Why am I here?",
  ["1003010801_165"]="Why can I hear your voice?",
  ["1003010801_166"]="That's something you'll have to recall on your own. I can't answer that for you.",
  ["1003010801_167"]="Imagine there's an instrument in your mind... Well, a tuning fork, let's say. Striking one creates vibrations that resonate with another, causing resonance.",
  ["1003010801_168"]="Well, stop with the questions. After all, I'm merely an echo without true self-awareness.",
  ["1003010801_169"]="Let me do what I do best. Would you like to hear me sing?",
  ["1003010801_17"]="Phaenomena turned around, clasping Aratos's hands in her own.",
  ["1003010801_170"]="Without waiting for an answer, she begins to sing.",
  ["1003010801_171"]="With the lingering melody hanging in the air, I, too, close my eyes.",
  ["1003010801_172"]="How did you know there was a planet there?",
  ["1003010801_173"]="Twin Stars",
  ["1003010801_18"]="Thank you, Phaenomena... I really appreciate it...",
  ["1003010801_19"]="Would you like to come to my presentation?",
  ["1003010801_2"]="An indeterminate span of time elapsed.",
  ["1003010801_20"]="You don't have to do anything. Just being there is enough.",
  ["1003010801_21"]="That will make me feel reassured.",
  ["1003010801_22"]="Yes...",
  ["1003010801_23"]="Up next on today's agenda. Scholar Aratos from the Astronomical Academy will be presenting her latest research.",
  ["1003010801_24"]="Please, Aratos.",
  ["1003010801_25"]="Thank you, Chairman, and thank you all, my esteemed colleagues.",
  ["1003010801_26"]="I'm presenting my latest paper—\"On Gravity's Decisive Influence on Celestial Movement and Planetary Orbits.\"",
  ["1003010801_27"]="Everyone's got a copy of the paper. So, let me briefly go over the main points. First, gravity is the dominant force on a cosmic scale, governing the movement of celestial bodies from planets to entire galaxies.",
  ["1003010801_28"]="Second, by measuring irregularities in planetary orbits, we can figure out the positions of undiscovered celestial bodies.",
  ["1003010801_29"]="Please allow me to remind you, Scholar Aratos. The scale of gravity's effects has yet to be clearly defined.",
  ["1003010801_3"]="Aratos stood nearly as tall as Phaenomena.",
  ["1003010801_30"]="So, are you still against the idea that gravity is the primary force behind celestial motion?",
  ["1003010801_31"]="I'm afraid so. I've read through your theory carefully, and it seems like you think gravity operates regardless of distance.",
  ["1003010801_32"]="Your statement is inaccurate. I've proposed a formula...",
  ["1003010801_33"]="I understand your formula, but the question is: does gravity need a medium for transmission? If not, you'll need to further explain how it can influence planets millions of light-years away without any medium.",
  ["1003010801_34"]="And if a medium is needed, it would have to fill the entire universe!",
  ["1003010801_35"]="According to your own formula, even if this medium had a density lower than air, its mass would still be massive enough to generate a gravitational force that could pull the entire universe together!",
  ["1003010801_36"]="I've presented my objections. Please, Scholar Aratos.",
  ["1003010801_37"]="Thank you, sir. Here's my response...",
  ["1003010801_38"]="The intense debate lasted over two hours. Though the scholars remain energetic, signs of fatigue were evident among many in the audience, with some at the rear nodding off.",
  ["1003010801_39"]="Aratos glanced toward the audience seats.",
  ["1003010801_4"]="She no longer had to stand on tiptoe to style Phaenomena's hair. Instead, she had to lean forward slightly to braid strands through that ocean of stars, weaving them into spiral galaxies.",
  ["1003010801_40"]="Sorry, Phaenomena. Just a bit longer, it's almost over.",
  ["1003010801_41"]="...",
  ["1003010801_42"]="Scholar Aratos, the cornerstone of science is falsifiability. Theories that cannot be falsified should be left to the theologians.",
  ["1003010801_43"]="Your theory doesn't even meet this basic requirement—it doesn't make any specific predictions at all! You might have built a beautiful house, but it's empty.",
  ["1003010801_44"]="My apologies, but at present, I indeed can't offer a falsifiable or verifiable prediction based on my gravitational theory.",
  ["1003010801_45"]="But I will continue my efforts, and I'm sure soon—",
  ["1003010801_46"]="...",
  ["1003010801_47"]="Previously silent in the audience, Phaenomena suddenly stood up and walked to the center of the venue.",
  ["1003010801_48"]="Hm? Phaenomena, please return to the audience seat and avoid disrupting the order.",
  ["1003010801_49"]="What are you up to, Phaenomena? Go back, now!",
  ["1003010801_5"]="Aratos, your hands are trembling.",
  ["1003010801_50"]="There's a planet. You haven't discovered it yet.",
  ["1003010801_51"]="What?",
  ["1003010801_52"]="The deformation of Saturn's orbit is caused by the gravity of a large planet.",
  ["1003010801_53"]="This is ridiculous.",
  ["1003010801_54"]="Saturn is the farthest planet from the Sun! Are you suggesting there's another undiscovered planet affecting Saturn's orbit?",
  ["1003010801_55"]="Incorrect. Saturn isn't the farthest.",
  ["1003010801_56"]="There's one even farther.",
  ["1003010801_57"]="Thank you for backing me up, Phaenomena, but the Society only accepts solid research papers...",
  ["1003010801_58"]="Wait.",
  ["1003010801_59"]="She seems confident. Let her finish.",
  ["1003010801_6"]="Pausing her actions, Aratos gazed at the flowing galaxy within her grasp, lost in contemplation.",
  ["1003010801_60"]="Chalk. Blackboard. I need them.",
  ["1003010801_61"]="Chairman, this outsider is disrupting the review process. I request—",
  ["1003010801_62"]="Give her what she needs.",
  ["1003010801_63"]="All our procedures aim to explore the truth. If she's wrong, it's just another fallacy, but if she's right, we can't afford to overlook the truth.",
  ["1003010801_64"]="Even you can't explain the deformation of Saturn's orbit, can you?",
  ["1003010801_65"]="That's... true.",
  ["1003010801_66"]="Alright, chalk and blackboard are ready. Now, please share your \"theory,\" Phaenomena.",
  ["1003010801_67"]="Phaenomena drew the currently known map of the solar system on the blackboard before adding a larger orbit beyond Saturn's.",
  ["1003010801_68"]="Here, there's one.",
  ["1003010801_69"]="It has fourteen times Earth's mass, with an orbital radius nineteen times Earth's.",
  ["1003010801_7"]="Yeah...",
  ["1003010801_70"]="How can you be... so sure?",
  ["1003010801_71"]="Phaenomena appeared somewhat perplexed.",
  ["1003010801_72"]="Because that's the truth.",
  ["1003010801_73"]="Nonsense! This is utter nonsense! Chairman, I request—",
  ["1003010801_74"]="Sir, doesn't this theory perfectly fulfill your requirement of falsifiability?",
  ["1003010801_75"]="Moreover, Chairman, Phaenomena has provided precise data. Considering her unique status, we should notify the observatory to verify her prediction.",
  ["1003010801_76"]="Agreed. I'll notify the observatory after the meeting.",
  ["1003010801_77"]="In the small garden beneath the tower of the Delphi Astronomical Academy.",
  ["1003010801_78"]="Academic conferences are seriously a pain.",
  ["1003010801_79"]="Gosh, is this what I'll have to face for the rest of my life?",
  ["1003010801_8"]="Today, I'm going to present my latest research findings at the Astronomical Academy's review meeting.",
  ["1003010801_80"]="You are tired.",
  ["1003010801_81"]="Yeah. I'm really grateful to the ancient sages for building this little garden at the Astronomical Academy. Maybe it's to prevent those desperate astronomers, who can't finish their papers, from jumping off the tower. After all, ruining such a beautiful garden with what's left of them would be a terrible waste...",
  ["1003010801_82"]="But hey, there's some good news today.",
  ["1003010801_83"]="...?",
  ["1003010801_84"]="The observation results are in, and they exactly match what you said.",
  ["1003010801_85"]="...At the edge of the solar system, another giant planet exists.",
  ["1003010801_86"]="It has seventeen times Earth's mass, with an orbital radius thirty times Earth's.",
  ["1003010801_87"]="Exactly as you predicted, down to the smallest detail.",
  ["1003010801_88"]="How exactly did you know this? Come on, tell me!",
  ["1003010801_89"]="...",
  ["1003010801_9"]="Are you nervous? Because of the meeting? Why?",
  ["1003010801_90"]="It's simply the truth.",
  ["1003010801_91"]="Ah, even though I knew I wouldn't get an answer from you, it's still frustrating.",
  ["1003010801_92"]="If all of future astronomy only relies on your predictions, what's the point of astronomers like us even existing?!",
  ["1003010801_93"]="Ahh, I'd better perk up. I don't want to join the ranks of those desperate astronomers...",
  ["1003010801_94"]="You called for me, Grand Scholar?",
  ["1003010801_95"]="The head of the Academy Nation, the Delphi Grand Scholar, sat behind a desk opposite Aratos, holding a sheet of paper.",
  ["1003010801_96"]="I believe you're well aware of Phaenomena's predictions.",
  ["1003010801_97"]="The Astronomical Academy has submitted the names for the new planets to our academic peers. The review will convene soon.",
  ["1003010801_98"]="Congratulations on your discoveries, Aratos.",
  ["1003010801_99"]="However, this also means... we'll have to conceal certain truths... once again.",
  ["1003010901_1"]="I've searched the entire garden, but still no sign of the red-haired girl Dean Ariadne mentioned.",
  ["1003010901_2"]="Maybe I should head back to the lecture halls.",
  ["1003010901_3"]="Girl",
  ["1003010902_1"]="These projections of the Sun and Earth, the venue resembling celestial orbits, and these memories...",
  ["1003010902_10"]="Faint footsteps cautiously approach from the rear, seemingly attempting to conceal their presence deliberately.",
  ["1003010902_11"]="Have the Nemesis snakes finally run out of patience?",
  ["1003010902_12"]="Logos does not turn around.",
  ["1003010902_13"]="At the precise moment the footsteps draw near, she swiftly spins around, thrusting Urania towards the figure behind her.",
  ["1003010902_14"]="Mmm...?",
  ["1003010902_15"]="Don't move.",
  ["1003010902_16"]="Your name, your role, and your reason for stalking me. You have ten seconds.",
  ["1003010902_17"]="Wait, red hair...? Could it be that... you're the one Dean Ariadne mentioned?",
  ["1003010902_18"]="No, I can't let my guard down. Your name, your role, and your reason for staying inside this academy at this moment. You have ten seconds. I need to confirm your identity.",
  ["1003010902_19"]="Mm! Mmmm—!",
  ["1003010902_2"]="I get it now. This is how heliocentrism was discovered.",
  ["1003010902_20"]="Contrary to Logos's anticipation of resistance, the response elicits an aggrieved whimper.",
  ["1003010902_21"]="The girl in front of her appears extremely frail, with faint traces of blood at the corner of her mouth, suggesting violent coughing recently.",
  ["1003010902_22"]="...You're injured?",
  ["1003010902_23"]="Gesturing at her throat, the girl opens her mouth, but no sound emerges.",
  ["1003010902_24"]="Then answer me by nodding or shaking your head.",
  ["1003010902_25"]="Are you a student from the Astronomical Academy?",
  ["1003010902_26"]="The girl nods.",
  ["1003010902_27"]="Then you must have received the evacuation notice. Why are you still lingering here?",
  ["1003010902_28"]="The girl points toward the observatory, making a gesture of stars rising.",
  ["1003010902_29"]="You want to go to the observatory?",
  ["1003010902_3"]="Alright, even foolishness has limits. Even if I don't know exactly when Neptune and Uranus were found, I'm certain about one thing—",
  ["1003010902_30"]="No way, it's too dangerous there. Whatever you've left there isn't worth taking the risk.",
  ["1003010902_31"]="Realizing that the girl is merely an injured student, Logos eases her vigilance slightly.",
  ["1003010902_32"]="By the way, what's your name...? Ah, never mind—I forgot you can't speak.",
  ["1003010902_33"]="Dean Ariadne sent me to find you. She said once I found you, I'd know what to do next.",
  ["1003010902_34"]="Given the situation, I can't leave an injured student in a place this dangerous. I must bring you back to the ground immediately for medical attention.",
  ["1003010902_35"]="Hearing this, the girl vehemently shakes her head.",
  ["1003010902_36"]="Wait, what are you intending to do?",
  ["1003010902_37"]="Mmm! Mmmmmm—!",
  ["1003010902_38"]="Anxiously attempting to speak, the girl's lips tremble as she opens her mouth, but only faint breaths escape.",
  ["1003010902_39"]="In desperation, she grabs Logos' wrist and swiftly ties the thread in her hand onto the lyre-sword.",
  ["1003010902_4"]="Heliocentrism was discovered at least six hundred years ago! Professor Aratos couldn't possibly have lived that long!",
  ["1003010902_40"]="Urania's strings quiver, emitting a series of aggrieved notes.",
  ["1003010902_41"]="\"My name is Aratos!\"",
  ["1003010902_42"]="A string of characters, woven from multicolored threads, materializes before Logos's eyes.",
  ["1003010902_5"]="Even if Professor Aratos had a lifespan as wondrous as Dean Phaenomena's, it's impossible for her to age backward from a mature adult when discovering heliocentrism, to a young woman in her twenties when discovering Uranus and Neptune!",
  ["1003010902_6"]="The timeline is all reversed!",
  ["1003010902_7"]="Unless... Aratos isn't just one person...",
  ["1003010902_8"]="Wait, the Grand Oracle said \"Aratos of this generation isn't ready yet.\" Could it be...",
  ["1003010902_9"]="While Logos is deep in thought, a rustling noise suddenly catches her attention from behind.",
  ["1003011001_1"]="In the afternoon, Aratos braided Phaenomena's hair as usual.",
  ["1003011001_10"]="Despite the chaos, I can shape this beautiful universe into a perfectly graceful circle.",
  ["1003011001_100"]="Sensing Aratos's shifting mood as her words trailed off, Phaenomena released the dandelion.",
  ["1003011001_101"]="...",
  ["1003011001_102"]="I've been sorting through my old diaries.",
  ["1003011001_103"]="I have a hypothesis. Can you hear sounds from the stars?",
  ["1003011001_104"]="Not just from the stars above, but even the earth beneath us constantly emits such sounds, right?",
  ["1003011001_105"]="And these sounds are inaudible to humans?",
  ["1003011001_106"]="Phaenomena nodded.",
  ["1003011001_107"]="The noise... It's noisy, but...",
  ["1003011001_108"]="But what?",
  ["1003011001_109"]="Aratos, your song...",
  ["1003011001_11"]="If only planetary orbits could be as simple and elegant as your hair... how wonderful would that be?",
  ["1003011001_110"]="My song can drown out those noises, right?",
  ["1003011001_111"]="Yeah... and also...",
  ["1003011001_112"]="Phaenomena pointed toward the sky.",
  ["1003011001_113"]="Song. Very faint. But, Aratos can make it louder.",
  ["1003011001_114"]="Then I can fall asleep.",
  ["1003011001_115"]="You mean, deep within the stars there's a song distinct from the noise, and my singing can amplify that song?",
  ["1003011001_116"]="What you're describing... sounds pretty much like acoustic resonance.",
  ["1003011001_117"]="Could it be the melody of the lullaby resonates with that specific song?",
  ["1003011001_118"]="Oh, no wonder you're so fond of tuning forks. It's because of this, right?",
  ["1003011001_119"]="What exactly is that noise in your ears? And what is that song...? How truly intriguing.",
  ["1003011001_12"]="Phaenomena appeared puzzled.",
  ["1003011001_120"]="Aratos began humming a soft melody.",
  ["1003011001_121"]="Phaenomena yawned, stretched gently, and curled up beside Aratos, drifting into sleep.",
  ["1003011001_122"]="Aratos tenderly brushed away the strands of hair from Phaenomena's forehead, a hint of sadness emerging on her face.",
  ["1003011001_123"]="How many generations have come and gone, only for us to realize today that our understanding of the universe was flawed?",
  ["1003011001_124"]="And how much longer will it take to find your homeworld, to truly understand what you are?",
  ["1003011001_125"]="When will I finally be able to give you a peaceful, uninterrupted sleep?",
  ["1003011001_126"]="My dear... and my poor little star.",
  ["1003011001_127"]="You're here again, my uninvited guest. By now, you must have noticed...",
  ["1003011001_128"]="How many generations... has it been?",
  ["1003011001_129"]="I haven't been keeping track, but surely... a very long time has passed.",
  ["1003011001_13"]="...Aren't they?",
  ["1003011001_130"]="You're that \"voice\" from deep within the stars, aren't you?",
  ["1003011001_131"]="I can't answer any more of your questions, I'm afraid. I don't have much time left.",
  ["1003011001_132"]="You've been listening to my songs for such a long, long time... May I ask you a small favor?",
  ["1003011001_133"]="What favor?",
  ["1003011001_134"]="Hmm... I'll tell you everything the next time we meet.",
  ["1003011001_136"]="Heliocentrism",
  ["1003011001_14"]="Unfortunately no, Phaenomena. Planetary orbits are scattered and messy, nowhere near as beautiful as your hair.",
  ["1003011001_15"]="Aratos sighed softly.",
  ["1003011001_16"]="What went wrong, exactly? Why can't the stars orbiting the Earth be as neat and lovely as your hair?",
  ["1003011001_17"]="Aratos, time to sleep.",
  ["1003011001_18"]="Ah, you go ahead and sleep, Phaenomena. I have to finish my paper—the Astronomical Academy's review committee has already urged me twice.",
  ["1003011001_19"]="Aratos, delayed?",
  ["1003011001_2"]="She was still in her prime, yet time had already left subtle traces around her eyes.",
  ["1003011001_20"]="Not intentionally... It's just that these orbits are too messy; I need to study them a bit more. A model like this can hardly be called beautiful at all...",
  ["1003011001_21"]="Don't wait up for me tonight. You can sleep on your own, right?",
  ["1003011001_22"]="...",
  ["1003011001_23"]="Yeah... My little star has become quite independent. Surely you can sleep by yourself now, right?",
  ["1003011001_24"]="Late at night.",
  ["1003011001_25"]="Aratos. Aratos?",
  ["1003011001_26"]="When Phaenomena entered the study, Aratos had already fallen asleep at her desk, snoring softly.",
  ["1003011001_27"]="Model...",
  ["1003011001_28"]="Several small spheres lay in front of Aratos, the most prominent one painted yellow labeled \"Sun,\" the rest marked with various planet names.",
  ["1003011001_29"]="...",
  ["1003011001_3"]="The innocence of childhood and the impulsiveness of youth had departed, replaced by a maturity refined through years.",
  ["1003011001_30"]="Phaenomena reached out, repositioning the spheres.",
  ["1003011001_31"]="The noise immediately woke Aratos, who had been lightly dozing.",
  ["1003011001_32"]="Phaenomena...? You're still awake?",
  ["1003011001_33"]="Huh, did you move my model? You naughty girl. These aren't toys, they're for my new thesis—",
  ["1003011001_34"]="She stopped abruptly, recalling that the blue \"Earth\" had been at the desk's center before her nap, now replaced by the golden \"Sun,\" with Earth situated behind Mercury and Venus.",
  ["1003011001_35"]="Phaenomena? Who told you to arrange it this way?",
  ["1003011001_36"]="...No one.",
  ["1003011001_37"]="Then how did you know to arrange it like this?",
  ["1003011001_38"]="Phaenomena appeared perplexed.",
  ["1003011001_39"]="Because, that's how it is.",
  ["1003011001_4"]="Her skilled hands effortlessly combed through Phaenomena's hair, smoothing out any tangles.",
  ["1003011001_40"]="Her gaze was sincere, devoid of any hint of deception.",
  ["1003011001_41"]="Was it... always supposed to be this way?",
  ["1003011001_42"]="...",
  ["1003011001_43"]="I get it now. Thank you, Phaenomena.",
  ["1003011001_44"]="My thesis... can finally come to a close.",
  ["1003011001_45"]="Scholar Aratos! You are insulting the entire Astronomical Academy!",
  ["1003011001_46"]="How could you present such a frivolous, irresponsible thesis for review?!",
  ["1003011001_47"]="Are you suggesting that everything we've dedicated our lives to is just a mirage—a joke?!",
  ["1003011001_48"]="Calm down, Chairman. I've always respected my colleagues at the Academy.",
  ["1003011001_49"]="But precisely because of this respect, I can't betray my academic integrity.",
  ["1003011001_5"]="...Aratos? What's on your thoughts?",
  ["1003011001_50"]="You know this best, Chairman, don't you?",
  ["1003011001_51"]="If my model were entirely nonsense, you'd have shattered it on the spot—instead of becoming so agitated.",
  ["1003011001_52"]="You're scared, in fact. You're scared of the truth I'm pointing out.",
  ["1003011001_53"]="I completely understand that fear. I've experienced it myself and even considered burning my manuscript, pretending I never delved into this topic...",
  ["1003011001_54"]="But the truth won't just vanish. Even if people close their eyes, refusing to look at the sky, the sun will still shine upon everything.",
  ["1003011001_55"]="The Earth does revolve around the Sun.",
  ["1003011001_56"]="At the center of the circular open-air lecture hall.",
  ["1003011001_57"]="Phew... What a headache.",
  ["1003011001_58"]="That paper certainly caused a lot of trouble.",
  ["1003011001_59"]="The situation has escalated to the Academy Nation level; the Grand Scholar himself will oversee my review next month.",
  ["1003011001_6"]="I was just thinking—my little star's hair has become a bit frizzy lately. Sneaking off to Nereus's shores, perhaps?",
  ["1003011001_60"]="Hmm... I might have to face the entire academic community this time.",
  ["1003011001_61"]="Who would've guessed that at my age, I'd still be building demonstration models myself, like a student...",
  ["1003011001_62"]="Aratos.",
  ["1003011001_63"]="Hmm? Oh, it's you, Phaenomena. Were you looking for me?",
  ["1003011001_64"]="Dinner. For you, Aratos.",
  ["1003011001_65"]="Phaenomena took out a loaf of bread.",
  ["1003011001_66"]="Aratos responded with a smile.",
  ["1003011001_67"]="Hey, my little star knows how to care for others now. That's sweet.",
  ["1003011001_68"]="But I need to finish assembling this model first. Can you wait in the audience seats for a bit?",
  ["1003011001_69"]="Phaenomena obediently went to the audience seats and seated herself.",
  ["1003011001_7"]="...",
  ["1003011001_70"]="She watched Aratos busy arranging the model at the center, her gaze shifting thoughtfully.",
  ["1003011001_71"]="Then she extended her fingers, beckoning several of the model parts.",
  ["1003011001_72"]="With a gentle flick of her fingertips, the sun settled neatly into the central groove, while the other planets smoothly slid into fresh orbits guided by unseen gravitational arcs.",
  ["1003011001_73"]="Phaenomena!",
  ["1003011001_74"]="Aratos's exclamation got stuck in her throat.",
  ["1003011001_75"]="She watched the girl wielding her invisible power to position Earth perfectly into the third orbit—like a child at play, yet precisely replicating every calculation on her draft paper.",
  ["1003011001_76"]="It's aligned now.",
  ["1003011001_77"]="...",
  ["1003011001_78"]="Rubbing her temples, Aratos sat beside Phaenomena, accepting the bread she offered.",
  ["1003011001_79"]="I've told you so many times not to show your ability outside...",
  ["1003011001_8"]="But no worries. With enough patience, even the most stubborn tangles can be smoothed out.",
  ["1003011001_80"]="...",
  ["1003011001_81"]="...Alright, my little star just wanted to lend a hand, and no one else was around. You didn't do anything wrong.",
  ["1003011001_82"]="I know you have a kind heart and extraordinary abilities, but let's not make it a regular thing, alright?",
  ["1003011001_83"]="Phaenomena lowered her head in silence.",
  ["1003011001_84"]="Alright, my little star. Help me with one more thing, then.",
  ["1003011001_85"]="Phaenomena raised her head.",
  ["1003011001_86"]="Come on, make them move. You can do that, right?",
  ["1003011001_87"]="Phaenomena snapped her fingers, setting all the celestial models in motion, orbiting orderly around the sun.",
  ["1003011001_88"]="Aratos watched the unfolding scene, astonished yet moved.",
  ["1003011001_89"]="Phaenomena... You're truly incredible.",
  ["1003011001_9"]="Setting aside the comb, Aratos began weaving Phaenomena's hair, and then coiled the finished fishtail braid into a neat, circular bun.",
  ["1003011001_90"]="How did you know that Earth should be moved away from the center of the universe?",
  ["1003011001_91"]="And how did you know that... the sun belongs at the center instead?",
  ["1003011001_92"]="At night, dandelions and fireflies danced gently on the grass beside the pavilion.",
  ["1003011001_93"]="Aratos spoke softly, uncertain if she was addressing Phaenomena or merely muttering to herself.",
  ["1003011001_94"]="The review is over. The Grand Scholar himself came to me, telling me to keep everything a secret.",
  ["1003011001_95"]="He said that it would take humanity generations to accept the idea that the Earth is in motion.",
  ["1003011001_96"]="I suppose so. Surely, other scholars aside from me must have figured this out, too.",
  ["1003011001_97"]="Honestly, I never really cared about worldly opinions. Convincing the world to embrace a new idea wasn't my aim when I first gazed at the stars.",
  ["1003011001_98"]="All I've ever really cared about was...",
  ["1003011001_99"]="Phaenomena leaned against Aratos, idly playing with a dandelion in her palm, and it wasn't clear how much of what she said had actually registered.",
  ["1003011101_1"]="Got it.",
  ["1003011101_10"]="Aratos lowers her head, instinctively touching her throat.",
  ["1003011101_11"]="(After the previous Aratos passed away, I was supposed to take over  her responsibilities, continuing to accompany Phaenomena.)",
  ["1003011101_12"]="(After the funeral, I was on my way to meet Phaenomena when I was attacked...)",
  ["1003011101_13"]="(When I regained consciousness, I was already here, with the Astronomical Academy in the sky... and then I met you.)",
  ["1003011101_14"]="Actually, Dean Phaenomena is currently missing.",
  ["1003011101_15"]="I've seen some memories she left behind in those energy projections.",
  ["1003011101_16"]="After the funeral, someone approached her from behind... That person was probably the last one she saw before disappearing.",
  ["1003011101_17"]="I suspect it could be someone from Nemesis, and if that's the case, the one who attacked you might be the same person.",
  ["1003011101_18"]="Do you remember anything about the attacker? Or have any idea who could be behind all this?",
  ["1003011101_19"]="(I'm sorry... I can't recall clearly.)",
  ["1003011101_2"]="Aratos... isn't one specific individual, but a title passed down through generations.",
  ["1003011101_20"]="The girl hesitates momentarily.",
  ["1003011101_21"]="(...However, the current situation probably wasn't caused by my attacker. The one who made the Astronomical Academy fly... is someone else entirely.)",
  ["1003011101_22"]="Who's that person?",
  ["1003011101_23"]="The girl trembles, evidently exerting great effort to steady the threads in her hands.",
  ["1003011101_24"]="(It's... Phaenomena.)",
  ["1003011101_25"]="How is this possible...? This is her academy, after all!",
  ["1003011101_26"]="(Only she possesses such power...)",
  ["1003011101_27"]="(I'm sorry... I don't have time to explain in detail, but please trust me, she's not doing this on purpose.)",
  ["1003011101_28"]="(She must be out of control now. We need to find a way to calm her down.)",
  ["1003011101_29"]="Calm her down...? But how can one calm down a star?",
  ["1003011101_3"]="And you are the current generation—the latest inheritor of the name \"Aratos.\"",
  ["1003011101_30"]="(The lullaby, Aratos's Lullaby. Every Aratos throughout the generations has sung this lullaby to soothe Phaenomena.)",
  ["1003011101_31"]="(Every Aratos has used this lullaby to comfort Phaenomena. It's been passed down through generations.)",
  ["1003011101_32"]="But your voice now...",
  ["1003011101_33"]="(As you can see... I believe the attacker destroyed my voice precisely to prevent us from calming Phaenomena.)",
  ["1003011101_34"]="(But there is another way.)",
  ["1003011101_35"]="Aratos glances towards the lyre-sword in Logos's hands.",
  ["1003011101_36"]="(You can play the melody of this lullaby.)",
  ["1003011101_37"]="(Recreate those melodies and notes with your strings.)",
  ["1003011101_38"]="...",
  ["1003011101_39"]="Now I finally understand why the Grand Oracle insisted on bringing me along to the Astronomical Academy.",
  ["1003011101_4"]="So, you—no, all of you—have always been with Dean Phaenomena? For thousands of years? Who exactly is she?",
  ["1003011101_40"]="(But this song... I'll need to figure out how to play it for you first... I can't reproduce this melody right now.)",
  ["1003011101_41"]="No need.",
  ["1003011101_42"]="Along the way, the energy overflowing from Dean Phaenomena left behind numerous fragments of her memories.",
  ["1003011101_43"]="I think I might be able to piece together the melody of that song from the memories I saw.",
  ["1003011101_44"]="But let me be clear, my professors always say my \"music\" is more like \"mathematics\" than art... I'm not sure if it'll work.",
  ["1003011101_45"]="(But we don't have any other options.)",
  ["1003011101_46"]="(Let's head to the observatory. Phaenomena must be there, I can feel it.)",
  ["1003011101_47"]="(She's probably more scared than anyone right now, like a celestial body off its orbit.)",
  ["1003011101_48"]="(Once we get there, please... play that song for her in my stead.)",
  ["1003011101_49"]="Methods",
  ["1003011101_5"]="(Thousands of years ago, a star landed in the Nereus Sea. For reasons unknown, it took human form and stepped onto the shore. She was later discovered by Delphic Oracle and named \"Phaenomena.\")",
  ["1003011101_6"]="Is she an anomaly?",
  ["1003011101_7"]="(Yes, she is, but you can also think of her as a living star.)",
  ["1003011101_8"]="But how could a star take human form? I still don't quite understand... but now isn't the time to delve deeper.",
  ["1003011101_9"]="Let me first ask the most pressing question—how did you get injured?",
  ["1003011301_1"]="(This is the Gravitational Wave Observation Chamber, the office where the previous Aratos worked.)",
  ["1003011301_10"]="(The previous Aratos suspected it might be related to gravitational waves, which led to her research.)",
  ["1003011301_11"]="Then... did the previous Professor Aratos reach a conclusion?",
  ["1003011301_12"]="(I'm not sure. I never received her manuscript. It seems she handed it directly to Phaenomena.)",
  ["1003011301_13"]="(Technically, she should have passed that manuscript to me. Honestly, I struggle to understand her thoughts at times. Odd, right? I mean, I'm Aratos too.)",
  ["1003011301_14"]="Manuscript? That rings a bell... In the projection of the white dwarf, I saw Dean Phaenomena holding Professor Aratos's leather notebook.",
  ["1003011301_15"]="Could it be that Dean Phaenomena found something in it?",
  ["1003011301_17"]="Gravitational Wave",
  ["1003011301_2"]="(Once we pass through this chamber and head upward, we'll reach the observatory.)",
  ["1003011301_3"]="By the way… what exactly is this chamber? I'm a bit curious.",
  ["1003011301_4"]="(See that machine there? That's the Gravitational Wave Observation Device. Gravitational waves were the focus of the previous Aratos's research.)",
  ["1003011301_5"]="(Simply put, gravitational waves are ripples in space. They occur due to the violent movements of massive celestial bodies and spread through the universe at the speed of light, resembling waves on water.)",
  ["1003011301_6"]="(They're vibrations of space-time itself. They don't need a medium to travel and can pass through anything, barely being hindered.)",
  ["1003011301_7"]="That's a bit complicated for me to grasp...",
  ["1003011301_8"]="(Phaenomena has always been haunted by a specific noise that rings in her ears—keeping her from finding peace. It's been like this ever since she fell to Earth.)",
  ["1003011301_9"]="(For millennia, every Aratos had been trying to find a way to silence that noise once and for all.)",
  ["1003011401_1"]="Dusk had descended.",
  ["1003011401_10"]="I see.",
  ["1003011401_11"]="...Delphi Gravitational Wave Observatory, now officially operational.",
  ["1003011401_12"]="The massive screen at the front of the hall abruptly inundated with all sorts of data and waveforms.",
  ["1003011401_13"]="Professor Aratos, could you briefly explain to us what all this data means?",
  ["1003011401_14"]="Most of it is interference. Only a small portion is actual gravitational wave signals. Our primary task is to distinguish real signals from the background noise…",
  ["1003011401_15"]="Aratos.",
  ["1003011401_16"]="Our instruments are highly sensitive. The sampling frequency is...",
  ["1003011401_17"]="Aratos.",
  ["1003011401_18"]="Hmm? Hold on a sec, Phaenomena. I'm still explaining things to our students.",
  ["1003011401_19"]="Records DE7453 to DE9268 are gravitational wave signals from a black hole.",
  ["1003011401_2"]="Time had etched line after line across Aratos's hands.",
  ["1003011401_20"]="Dean Phaenomena, how can you be sure those are gravitational wave signals?",
  ["1003011401_21"]="Because they are.",
  ["1003011401_22"]="Well, our dean has a rather uncanny academic intuition. Let's double check her prediction.",
  ["1003011401_23"]="Extract the records Dean Phaenomena mentioned and compare the waveforms.",
  ["1003011401_24"]="Professor Aratos! Dean Phaenomena's prediction was completely accurate!",
  ["1003011401_25"]="It sounds beautiful. I like it. It feels… familiar.",
  ["1003011401_26"]="Um... Excuse me, Dean Phaenomena? I didn't quite understand what you meant.",
  ["1003011401_27"]="...It's a voice I heard a long time ago.",
  ["1003011401_28"]="Are you... talking about gravitational waves? Are you saying gravitational waves sound beautiful?",
  ["1003011401_29"]="Aratos quickly stepped in to resolve the situation.",
  ["1003011401_3"]="Her fingers, shaped by years, gently brushed through Phaenomena's hair.",
  ["1003011401_30"]="Well, Dean Phaenomena was actually talking about a concert we attended together yesterday! She does tend to switch topics abruptly. As you know, geniuses often have their quirks...",
  ["1003011401_31"]="Phaenomena appeared confused.",
  ["1003011401_32"]="Quirks? Do I have quirks?",
  ["1003011401_33"]="Aratos ignored her.",
  ["1003011401_34"]="All right, let's have Dean Phaenomena step down now. She has other things on her schedule, and I'll be answering your questions from here.",
  ["1003011401_35"]="Phew... finally dealt with that.",
  ["1003011401_36"]="She now stood alone in the empty hall, the screen still flickering with the gravitational wave signals Phaenomena had pointed out earlier.",
  ["1003011401_37"]="Aratos stared at the gently undulating waveform for a long time as if studying a bizarre brain scan.",
  ["1003011401_38"]="Gravitational waves… are a form of sound to Phaenomena?",
  ["1003011401_39"]="Wait, this matches the content in the diary… I hope this isn't just a coincidence.",
  ["1003011401_4"]="Phaenomena, we're going to the Gravitational Wave Observatory today.",
  ["1003011401_40"]="If gravitational waves are sound to her, then perhaps the only wave from deep space that is not noise to her... and the song...",
  ["1003011401_41"]="Maybe I should conduct a study based on this hypothesis.",
  ["1003011401_42"]="But of course, I mustn't share this with the Society…",
  ["1003011401_43"]="Aratos.",
  ["1003011401_44"]="What are we doing today?",
  ["1003011401_45"]="Today? Well, nothing. Just rest.",
  ["1003011401_46"]="Rest...?",
  ["1003011401_47"]="I'm getting on in years, Phaenomena. I don't have the energy I used to.",
  ["1003011401_48"]="Getting on in years...",
  ["1003011401_49"]="Yeah... I've aged. I can no longer keep up with you along the shore.",
  ["1003011401_5"]="What are we doing there?",
  ["1003011401_50"]="My fingers can no longer weave those delicate garlands for you.",
  ["1003011401_51"]="Even singing a song leaves me breathless these days.",
  ["1003011401_53"]="...",
  ["1003011401_54"]="Sometimes I envy you. You're like a star, unchanging, harboring no fear of death.",
  ["1003011401_55"]="There's no need to fear death.",
  ["1003011401_56"]="Oh? Why's that?",
  ["1003011401_57"]="Phaenomena rummaged through Aratos's desk for a while, pulling out an introductory textbook on astronomy.",
  ["1003011401_58"]="\"On this planet, matter and energy circulate endlessly. Life grows, reproduces, passes its flesh through the food chain, becomes bone and decay, then decomposes and returns to the earth. But the atoms remain. They are still part of this planet. They never truly end.\"",
  ["1003011401_59"]="Death is simply the redistribution of energy and information.",
  ["1003011401_6"]="As usual, you don't need to do anything. Just be there.",
  ["1003011401_60"]="She came to a conclusion.",
  ["1003011401_61"]="...",
  ["1003011401_62"]="Hahaha… My little star, you never fail to surprise me.",
  ["1003011401_63"]="Yeah… death is just the redistribution of energy and information. The atoms that form us have existed since the beginning of the universe. Even if our bodies perish, we do not become nothing...",
  ["1003011401_64"]="Aratos looked at Phaenomena with a motherly affection, as if intending on etching her into her memory forever.",
  ["1003011401_65"]="Read me something else, will you, Phaenomena?",
  ["1003011401_66"]="Aratos, you used to be the one reading to me.",
  ["1003011401_67"]="Haha, that \"used to\" you're talking about—feels like forever ago.",
  ["1003011401_68"]="As I said, I'm getting on in years. I can't see the words clearly anymore.",
  ["1003011401_69"]="You read to me. Over there, third row from the top, second book from the left…",
  ["1003011401_7"]="The Gravitational Wave Observation System has been activated, and the academy plans to hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony.",
  ["1003011401_70"]="\"A Collection of Little Poems About the Universe, Life, and Everything\"?",
  ["1003011401_71"]="That's the one. Just open it anywhere and share whatever catches your eye.",
  ["1003011401_72"]="...Alright.",
  ["1003011401_73"]="\"Death is nothing to us; for that which has been dissolved into its elements experiences no sensations, and that which has no sensation is nothing to us.\"",
  ["1003011401_74"]="\"It's not about the length of life, but how you live it.\"",
  ["1003011401_75"]="...",
  ["1003011401_76"]="…Aratos? What are you writing?",
  ["1003011401_77"]="Ah, you got me.",
  ["1003011401_78"]="It's nothing—just an old woman jotting down some trivial moments from her life. Carry on with the reading.",
  ["1003011401_79"]="Alright.",
  ["1003011401_8"]="They'll handle everything. They just need you, the dean, to witness it.",
  ["1003011401_80"]="\"Parting isn't really that scary.\"",
  ["1003011401_81"]="Aratos sat among stacks of books, scribbling fervently in a notebook.",
  ["1003011401_82"]="—Phaenomena, if you ever need help, go find Mr. Botano. &Show him respect in the presence of outsiders.",
  ["1003011401_83"]="\"You and I are both children of the stars.\"",
  ["1003011401_84"]="—If one day you can't find Mr. Botano, &just ask around the academy for whoever is the current Grand Scholar of Delphi, and go find them.",
  ["1003011401_85"]="\"Each cell narrates the universe's tale.\"",
  ["1003011401_86"]="—Eventually you might find that this Grand Scholar is also gone. &In this case, repeat the process—ask for the new Grand Scholar, and go find them...",
  ["1003011401_87"]="\"When you gaze at yourself, you see the outline of the cosmos.\"",
  ["1003011401_88"]="—Your favorite honey cake is baked in Blue Hat Bakery, at 2 Beech Street. &No need for payment, just tell them how many pieces you took, and they'll charge it to the Delphi Astronomical Academy's account.",
  ["1003011401_89"]="\"According to the law of conservation—you see—death has never existed.\"",
  ["1003011401_9"]="We've… never been this close to success.",
  ["1003011401_90"]="—If one day they say the price has gone up, just tell them to talk to the academy. &Don't let them bother you about it.",
  ["1003011401_91"]="\"We're just being temporarily taken back by the universe, waiting for the next journey together.\"",
  ["1003011401_92"]="—If someone tells you the Gustav family no longer makes cakes, refer to the previous note. &Go to Mr. Botano or the current Grand Scholar of Delphi, &and they'll help you find another bakery that cooks delicious honey cakes…",
  ["1003011401_93"]="Inside Professor Aratos's study, the girl's monotone voice persisted, while the elderly woman warmly, the creases on her countenance failing to conceal her joy.",
  ["1003011401_94"]="Around them, notebooks brimming with content were stacked high, covering half the study.",
  ["1003011401_96"]="Dusk",
  ["1003011501_1"]="I am Aratos, a professor of astronomy, serving Delphi Academy Nation and the Delphic Oracle.",
  ["1003011501_10"]="But even if she's from the heavens, that doesn't give her the right to raid my honey stash under the bed!",
  ["1003011501_100"]="The funeral of the 104th Aratos concluded.",
  ["1003011501_101"]="Phaenomena Kamitis read the final words left by her friend Aratos.",
  ["1003011501_102"]="Much of the content eluded her comprehension, yet a stirring sensation quietly touched something within her chest, squeezing it.",
  ["1003011501_103"]="Driven by instinct, she set down Aratos's aged notebook and closed her eyes. For the first time, she tried to listen to the \"noise\" that had haunted her for millennia,as well as the nearly imperceptible melody hidden beneath that noise.",
  ["1003011501_104"]="It was the same melody that resonated with Aratos's lullaby, the part that calmed her—a melody ingrained within her since birth.",
  ["1003011501_105"]="What was that melody?",
  ["1003011501_106"]="One word flickered through her mind.",
  ["1003011501_107"]="\"Home.\"",
  ["1003011501_108"]="Eventually, the late-blooming girl raised her brush, trying to draw lines between the abstract thoughts in her mind and the tangible emotions in her heart.",
  ["1003011501_109"]="The shift in that tune was prolonged, subtle, and hard to perceive, yet ingrained knowledge buried deep within in her essence confirmed the transition from euphoria to grief, and its origin...",
  ["1003011501_11"]="Bad star! That was a whole season's worth of honey… and she ate it all! Not a drop left for me!",
  ["1003011501_110"]="Phaenomena raised her head, gazing towards the clear sky above the funeral hall. The sun still hung high, yet she sensed that beyond the sun, the melancholic melody persisted, its source residing in what humanity called the \"Galactic Center Black Hole.\"",
  ["1003011501_111"]="4.3 million times the mass of the sun, located in the direction of Sagittarius, 26,000 light-years distant—a supermassive black hole whose gravity steers the entire Milky Way in orbit. She retrieved all this knowledge in an instant.",
  ["1003011501_112"]="Yet that wasn't her true home.",
  ["1003011501_113"]="Phaenomena continued to listen attentively. Gradually, she realized something.",
  ["1003011501_114"]="That melody came from the black hole's direction. More precisely, it came from the other side of the space-time fabric distorted by the black hole.",
  ["1003011501_115"]="To her, the melody was familiar, yet to this universe, it was utterly foreign. It could only be an echo from another distant universe, transmitted through the black hole into the human cosmos.",
  ["1003011501_116"]="From the sorrowful shift in the melody, Phaenomena discerned that it originated from a dying universe.",
  ["1003011501_117"]="One succumbing to gravitational forces, collapsing into a singularity. One that had perished countless eons ago. What lingered in her ears was the final vestige of that forgotten universe—a remnant that followed her into this realm.",
  ["1003011501_119"]="...Death.",
  ["1003011501_120"]="That term, once explained to her by Aratos, resurfaced in her mind.",
  ["1003011501_121"]="What is death?",
  ["1003011501_122"]="—Death is simply the redistribution of energy and information.",
  ["1003011501_123"]="Why define death this way?",
  ["1003011501_124"]="—Because no matter how many times she has experienced a funeral like this, &the next day, Aratos would always return, take her hand, &and lull her to sleep... with that cherished song.",
  ["1003011501_125"]="—Aratos would never stop singing, and the song of her home would always surround her. &To her, it feels all so natural.",
  ["1003011501_126"]="A fragrant breeze brushes softly through Phaenomena's hair, lingering around her shoulders as if delicately combing through her strands.",
  ["1003011501_127"]="She turns around abruptly, her vision engulfed by a myriads of fluttering white petals…",
  ["1003011501_128"]="Among them, there was a streak of crimson—soon to be swallowed by the white expanse.",
  ["1003011501_129"]="—Come, Phaenomena. Let me tell you what death truly is.",
  ["1003011501_13"]="Phaenomena has been on Earth for centuries.",
  ["1003011501_130"]="—Such is death: starting today, no one will sing for you ever again.",
  ["1003011501_131"]="—Not the stars above, nor the one lying still within this coffin.",
  ["1003011501_132"]="—There is no home for you to return to anymore.",
  ["1003011501_133"]="No…",
  ["1003011501_134"]="The swirling petals carried that crimson hue far into the farthest reaches of the sky. Even the song from the stars began to wane.",
  ["1003011501_135"]="Instinctively, she reached out her hand to stop it.",
  ["1003011501_137"]="And in the next moment...",
  ["1003011501_138"]="The entire Astronomical Academy rose from the ground, darting toward the black hole at the core of the galaxy.",
  ["1003011501_139"]="Funeral",
  ["1003011501_14"]="Compared to earlier records, her language skills have improved significantly.",
  ["1003011501_15"]="However, her fragmented words still offer no clues to her origin.",
  ["1003011501_16"]="I once tried to divine her origin by studying the angle and density of the starlight falling from her hair.",
  ["1003011501_17"]="But even the most skilled diviners came up with nonsense: \"inside a raven's egg,\" \"on the ocean three thousand sky-days away,\" or \"within the shadow of a lunar eclipse\"...",
  ["1003011501_18"]="Well, it seems the gods never intended to reveal the answer in my lifetime.",
  ["1003011501_19"]="Well, next time I'll try divining what Phaenomena fancies more—me, or the honey cakes I bring her...",
  ["1003011501_2"]="Here I record the final—and perhaps greatest—research of my life.",
  ["1003011501_21"]="These are turbulent times.",
  ["1003011501_22"]="In the West—Japheth, in the South—Memphis, and in the East—Obed, ambitious conquerors have emerged.",
  ["1003011501_23"]="The entire Philistine Sea is now aflame with war. The tiny Nereus Sea on its fringe is like a washbasin in a tempest, and Delphi is but a bubble atop that basin.",
  ["1003011501_24"]="The Delphic Oracle is struggling just to fend off threats. Even commoners like me have to undergo combat training every three days, always prepared to defend the city walls.",
  ["1003011501_25"]="The mystery of Phaenomena, left behind by my predecessors… I suppose it'll have to be passed on to those who come after us, in more peaceful times.",
  ["1003011501_26"]="By the way, as I write this, Phaenomena is munching on the last honey cake pulled from the Grand Scholar's private stash, crumbs everywhere. I envy her carefree spirit.",
  ["1003011501_28"]="Since the invention of the telescope, astronomy has become an entirely new science.",
  ["1003011501_29"]="Now, we have more tools to investigate Phaenomena's origins.",
  ["1003011501_3"]="It was initiated by Aratos, but it did not begin with me.",
  ["1003011501_30"]="Relying on ancient records, we've mapped out the rough trajectory of her descent into the Nereus Sea.",
  ["1003011501_31"]="If these records are accurate, her origin is not from any planet known to us.",
  ["1003011501_32"]="Based on orbital calculations, there were no major planets in that direction on the night she fell.",
  ["1003011501_33"]="So... could she have come from somewhere far beyond? From among the countless stars?",
  ["1003011501_35"]="Physics has finally taken a monumental leap forward!",
  ["1003011501_36"]="Our understanding of the universe has entered an unprecedented realm.",
  ["1003011501_37"]="We now recognize that the world we live in is but a grain of sand in the Milky Way—and the Milky Way itself is but a grain of sand in the universe.",
  ["1003011501_38"]="Faced with such immense space and time, can we ever figure out the origin of the \"anomaly\" named Phaenomena?",
  ["1003011501_4"]="Ever since the star named \"Phaenomena\" fell into the Nereus Sea thousands of years ago, every Aratos has pondered: Where did she come from?",
  ["1003011501_40"]="I've decided to apply the latest biological methods to study Phaenomena.",
  ["1003011501_41"]="Although she appears no different from a human, there must be components in her form that science deems \"non-human.\"",
  ["1003011501_42"]="Phaenomena was cooperative. She plucked a strand of her hair, scraped off oral epithelial cells, and… well, I'll spare the details.",
  ["1003011501_43"]="I intended to discover—what exactly her body is made of.",
  ["1003011501_44"]="However, the results shocked me. I've included a detailed report—this must not be made public, or else the hard-fought victory of evolution over theology may be overturned.",
  ["1003011501_46"]="Thousands of years have passed. Our predecessors have tried nearly every way to study Phaenomena, and yet the mysteries surrounding her remain unsolved.",
  ["1003011501_47"]="Those who attempted to analyze her through physics and biology inspired me.",
  ["1003011501_48"]="Physics, at its core, delves into two things: matter and force.",
  ["1003011501_49"]="All life is essentially a mix of these two elements. The modern carbon-based biosphere we know is founded upon atoms, molecules, and electromagnetic forces.",
  ["1003011501_5"]="Here are the conclusions from us, all generations of Aratos.",
  ["1003011501_50"]="In this case, could Phaenomena's differences from us \"humans\" lie on a deeper level? A level rooted in fundamental matter and force?",
  ["1003011501_51"]="There are four fundamental forces: the strong force, the weak force, the electromagnetic force, and gravity.",
  ["1003011501_52"]="All this time we've assumed Phaenomena came from a distant celestial body in the depths of space, but... what if the hypothesis is flawed?",
  ["1003011501_53"]="What if… she is a \"celestial body\" herself?",
  ["1003011501_54"]="Gravity stands as the primary force shaping celestial bodies and steering their movements.",
  ["1003011501_55"]="Those inexplicable results from Phaenomena's \"biological sample analysis reports\"… If her body is formed through gravitational cohesion, then it might finally start to make sense.",
  ["1003011501_56"]="I need more experiments, better instruments, and most importantly, more funding! I'll have to come up with more convincing reasons to persuade the Grand Scholar to loosen that tight purse...",
  ["1003011501_58"]="Lately, I've been reorganizing everything we know about Phaenomena.",
  ["1003011501_59"]="It seems the generations before me overlooked a crucial detail… the \"noise\" that troubles her.",
  ["1003011501_60"]="We've always treated it as a medical matter, as this frontier of research has long been led by the Delphi Medical Academy, and the previous Aratoses merely played the role of \"a family member of the patient.\"",
  ["1003011501_61"]="To this day, the Society's physicians believe it to be a unique form of tinnitus.",
  ["1003011501_62"]="Naturally, if someone constantly hears strange sounds wherever they go, tinnitus is the most logical suspicion.",
  ["1003011501_63"]="But what if… it's something entirely different? What if the \"sound\" is truly omnipresent, filling all of space?",
  ["1003011501_64"]="And if Phaenomena is truly the only one who can hear it...",
  ["1003011501_65"]="If my earlier hypothesis about gravitational life is correct, then a being composed of gravity, like Phaenomena, should be able to receive gravitational waves—the waves generated by the constant movements of celestial bodies across the universe!",
  ["1003011501_66"]="I must push the Academy Nation to construct a gravitational wave observatory as soon as possible!",
  ["1003011501_68"]="Another question: why is it that the ancient song passed down through the Aratos lineage can drown out the noises in Phaenomena's ears?",
  ["1003011501_69"]="To find out the answer, I consulted musicians in the Society, and they provided documents on acoustics and phonology. I tried to delve into them, but they left me utterly baffled. My only guess is that the frequencies in the song somehow interfere with or resonate against the chaotic gravitational wave noises, resulting in a calming effect.",
  ["1003011501_7"]="Phaenomena is a dolt! She can't explain where she's from or even form proper sentences!",
  ["1003011501_71"]="The gravitational wave observatory is finally complete. On its very first day of operation, Phaenomena identified a gravitational wave signal.",
  ["1003011501_72"]="She said it \"sounded beautiful,\" that she liked it, that it felt familiar.",
  ["1003011501_73"]="Upon analysis, the signal traced back… to the supermassive black hole at the core of the galaxy.",
  ["1003011501_74"]="Gravitational waves are everywhere. If human ears could \"hear\" them, then the entire universe would roar with deafening, indistinguishable static.",
  ["1003011501_75"]="But Phaenomena can discern a single familiar melody amidst this overwhelming cacophony.",
  ["1003011501_76"]="\"Familiar,\" \"beautiful\"… it seems she has a strong affinity for it.",
  ["1003011501_77"]="However, further investigation revealed that the \"gravitational wave song\" Phaenomena liked was not generated by the black hole's movements.",
  ["1003011501_78"]="From its waveform, if the black hole's movement is a \"note,\" then what Phaenomena heard was more like a \"chorus.\"",
  ["1003011501_79"]="Where is this \"chorus\" coming from? We haven't figured out any corresponding gravitational source yet.",
  ["1003011501_8"]="How can we expect someone with a smaller vocabulary than mine to detail her beginnings?",
  ["1003011501_80"]="Ah… I might be onto something.",
  ["1003011501_81"]="Beneath a black hole lies a singularity—an existence beyond the reach of physical comprehension.",
  ["1003011501_82"]="If the theory of \"space-time bridge\" created by black holes is true, and if black holes are shortcuts connecting distant regions of space-time, then the \"sound\" Phaenomena hears may originate from the other side of a space-time distortion…",
  ["1003011501_83"]="What lies on the other side of the \"bridge\"?",
  ["1003011501_84"]="Perhaps it's a realm shrouded in mystery to humanity, or perhaps... another universe.",
  ["1003011501_85"]="And in that universe, celestial bodies harmonize in a chorus only Phaenomena can understand.",
  ["1003011501_86"]="As for the celestial bodies in our universe... they cannot \"sing\" yet.",
  ["1003011501_87"]="It's like the contrast between the inorganic sound of ocean waves and the melodic song of a whale.",
  ["1003011501_88"]="...Heavens. If that's true, what a wondrous sight it would be.",
  ["1003011501_89"]="A universe teeming with \"living\" celestial bodies...",
  ["1003011501_9"]="The only evidence we can rely on is the starlight scattered in her hair. She probably came from somewhere as far as the stars…",
  ["1003011501_90"]="Could Phaenomena have once been part of that realm?",
  ["1003011501_92"]="Phaenomena... my sister, my playmate, my little one, my child.",
  ["1003011501_93"]="I want to help you find your way home.",
  ["1003011501_94"]="But Academy Nation has come to a conclusion, that with humanity's current scientific capability and the pace at which technology is advancing, it would take at least another six centuries to sift through signals from the immense ocean of gravitational waves to find signals that match those from your home.",
  ["1003011501_95"]="That would be something left for the 130th or so generation of Aratos to witness.",
  ["1003011501_96"]="And even after identifying that signal, it would take far, far longer still to construct a vessel capable of journeying to the other side...",
  ["1003011501_97"]="My remaining years are limited. I won't be able to help you in your quest for home.",
  ["1003011501_98"]="There are so many things I need to tell you before my end, just in case this clumsy girl of mine can't take care of herself and ends up being a burden on the next Aratos.",
  ["1003011601_10"]="This kind of emotional turmoil isn't something you'd expect from a cold, emotionless star.",
  ["1003011601_11"]="Following Ariadne's gaze, Phaenomena floats weightlessly above the observatory, like a child suspended in midair.",
  ["1003011601_12"]="Undulating energy streams gently from her body, silently blanketing the entire academy.",
  ["1003011601_13"]="I tried using my golden threads to soothe Dean Phaenomena's emotions… but it's only a temporary measure.",
  ["1003011601_14"]="Since Aratos can't speak now, we've lost our only method of soothing her.",
  ["1003011601_15"]="It won't be long before Dean Phaenomena breaks free and descends into frenzy again.",
  ["1003011601_16"]="(I'm sorry… if only I'd reached her sooner.)",
  ["1003011601_17"]="Dean Ariadne, we still have one more option.",
  ["1003011601_18"]="On the way to the observatory, I saw many memory projections from the past.",
  ["1003011601_19"]="The melody that generations of Aratos used to hum to Dean Phaenomena—I've reconstructed it from those memories.",
  ["1003011601_2"]="Ariadne holds a sketchpad, leisurely doodling on it. Her carefree demeanor stands in stark contrast to the howling wind enveloping the tower.",
  ["1003011601_20"]="The tune is not complicated. If I use Urania to perform it, I won't miss a single note.",
  ["1003011601_21"]="To locate Aratos in all this chaos and restore that melody... Logos, you truly are an exceptional Scholar.",
  ["1003011601_22"]="Still... I'd prefer if you took another approach.",
  ["1003011601_23"]="What does that mean, Dean Ariadne?",
  ["1003011601_24"]="I want you to go back with Aratos. Take the rotor-wing device and leave this academy.",
  ["1003011601_25"]="The academy is at a dangerously high altitude… We can't afford any mistakes.",
  ["1003011601_26"]="If your music doesn't work, I'll immediately summon the Labyrinth of Reverie to keep Dean Phaenomena under control... until she calms down completely.",
  ["1003011601_27"]="In this case, however... you'll be trapped within the labyrinth too. Under these conditions, I can't guarantee your survival.",
  ["1003011601_28"]="...",
  ["1003011601_29"]="(My answer remains the same, Grand Oracle.)",
  ["1003011601_3"]="Sensing someone approach, she lazily raises her eyelids.",
  ["1003011601_30"]="(Please allow me to go with her.)",
  ["1003011601_31"]="This generation's Aratos… I can see it. You're kind and softhearted.",
  ["1003011601_32"]="But you must realize this: Phaenomena has never met you, and in her current state, she may not recognize you as the \"Aratos\" in her memory.",
  ["1003011601_33"]="You don't need to take this risk.",
  ["1003011601_34"]="She's right. You should step back. If it's just the performance, I can handle it alone.",
  ["1003011601_35"]="(I know… and that's exactly why I can't leave Phaenomena here alone.)",
  ["1003011601_36"]="(This lullaby is meant to help her drift off in peace.)",
  ["1003011601_37"]="(For millennia, every time this melody played, there was always an Aratos by her side… listening to her murmurs, forgiving her stubbornness, and offering comfort.)",
  ["1003011601_38"]="(If I can't give her the companionship she needs now... my little star must be feeling so frightened, so lost...)",
  ["1003011601_39"]="(No matter what happens, please let me, as \"Aratos,\" be there until the very end.)",
  ["1003011601_4"]="Hmm, not too late. Glad you finally brought her here.",
  ["1003011601_40"]="I'm feeling your determination.",
  ["1003011601_41"]="Logos, are you staying too?",
  ["1003011601_42"]="Of course.",
  ["1003011601_43"]="As the Head Student, it's my duty to protect every asset of the academy; as a Society member, it's my responsibility to contain wild anomalies.",
  ["1003011601_44"]="Unless you, the Grand Oracle, directly command me otherwise, I have no reason to walk away.",
  ["1003011601_45"]="Well...",
  ["1003011601_46"]="A long breath escapes Ariadne's lips, as though it carries countless unspeakable thoughts.",
  ["1003011601_47"]="In that case… I'll respect your decisions.",
  ["1003011601_48"]="Let's go. It's time to face the star.",
  ["1003011601_5"]="I've got a general grasp of the situation.",
  ["1003011601_50"]="Face the Stars",
  ["1003011601_51"]="In front of the observatory",
  ["1003011601_6"]="So, Aratos, you can't calm Phaenomena either, right?",
  ["1003011601_7"]="(I'm afraid so.)",
  ["1003011601_8"]="(Phaenomena's situation is unusual. Nothing like this has been recorded by previous generations of Aratos.)",
  ["1003011601_9"]="Indeed, I've never seen her like this before, wrapped in avoidance, pain, and despair.",
  ["1003011602_1"]="Phaenomena floated beneath the shattered sky dome, her blue hair billowing like a nebula in a storm.",
  ["1003011602_10"]="Before the breath fully leaves her chest, Ariadne opens her eyes wide, staring straight at Phaenomena.",
  ["1003011602_11"]="Logos!",
  ["1003011602_12"]="No further explanation is needed. Though momentarily dazed, Logos snaps back to awareness, plucking the strings of Urania in her hands.",
  ["1003011602_13"]="A gentle and melodious tune flows from her fingertips, akin to meandering stream among the stars. The tune, like a mother’s embrace, reaches out to cradle Phaenomena adrift in the air.",
  ["1003011602_14"]="Enveloped by the melody, Phaenomena's stellar radiance fades away. She returns to her human form, her expression blank and perplexed.",
  ["1003011602_15"]="Descending slowly to the ground, she collapses to her knees, opening her eyes in a bewildered daze.",
  ["1003011602_16"]="Then, the familiar crimson hue gradually appears in her vision.",
  ["1003011602_17"]="The hue is vivid and vibrant—so intense that it punctures Phaenomena's eyes like a needle.",
  ["1003011602_18"]="A surge of repulsion bursts from Phaenomena, centered on her body.",
  ["1003011602_19"]="No... you're... You're NOT Aratos!",
  ["1003011602_2"]="Her form—no longer that of a human girl—resembles a starry river shaped by gravity itself. Beneath her skin no longer courses blood, but a radiant azure light like a supernova's eruption.",
  ["1003011602_20"]="Yet, the red-haired girl persists through the razor-sharp turbulence—",
  ["1003011602_21"]="And hold Phaenomena in a tight embrace.",
  ["1003011602_3"]="Her voice ceases to be vocal vibrations, but the tremble of space itself.",
  ["1003011602_4"]="With each syllable uttered, the atmosphere cracks like glass, rendering her murmurs barely discernible.",
  ["1003011602_5"]="After several exchanges, Ariadne finally realizes that the celestial being before her is not to be easily extinguished.",
  ["1003011602_6"]="She casts a meaningful glance toward Logos, who immediately comprehends and leaps to the edge of the platform.",
  ["1003011602_7"]="Just a fleeting rest with eyes closed, no deep dive. Alarm goes off in 100 milliseconds... Phew...",
  ["1003011602_8"]="Drawing a deep breath, Ariadne closes her eyes.",
  ["1003011602_9"]="Phaenomena, drifting in the sky, seemed to be bound by countless invisible threads, motionless in midair.",
  ["1003011701_1"]="A millennium ago.",
  ["1003011701_10"]="Billions of stars from tens of thousands of light-years away flowed within it.",
  ["1003011701_100"]="(Time to sing.)",
  ["1003011701_101"]="Sing? But what to sing? Her voice, now hoarse and off-key, struggles to hit the right notes...",
  ["1003011701_103"]="(It's okay. Anything will do.)",
  ["1003011701_104"]="(It's okay. However it sounds, it's good enough.)",
  ["1003011701_105"]="That voice reassures her, resolute and unwavering.",
  ["1003011701_106"]="And so, she strains her vocal cords, tears blurring her sight, and begins to sing—softly, brokenly.",
  ["1003011701_107"]="Then, the star in her arms… finally hears her song—and stops burning.",
  ["1003011701_109"]="The blue-haired girl stands alone amidst an ocean of white flowers.",
  ["1003011701_11"]="Beauty cascaded above her endlessly, yet not a single star lingered for her—they all would be swallowed by the sea.",
  ["1003011701_110"]="She turns around and gazes at me.",
  ["1003011701_111"]="I always believed… that whenever I turn around, she'll always be there by my side.",
  ["1003011701_112"]="…Was I just too foolish? Only now do I realize—nothing should ever be taken for granted.",
  ["1003011701_114"]="Yeah, you're a naive girl.",
  ["1003011701_115"]="I didn't know what to do. I just didn't want to lose her. I wanted to hold on to her.",
  ["1003011701_116"]="But in the end… I couldn't hold on to anything.",
  ["1003011701_118"]="Well, they... they asked me to pass along a message to you—",
  ["1003011701_12"]="Just as she could not pluck a star from the sky as easily as she might pick a seashell from the beach.",
  ["1003011701_120"]="\"I love you, Phaenomena.\"",
  ["1003011701_121"]="...",
  ["1003011701_122"]="Aratos, I miss the honey you used to stash under your bed.",
  ["1003011701_123"]="I miss the hide-and-seek games we played.",
  ["1003011701_124"]="You said you liked it when I read you poems, but I never finished the last one...",
  ["1003011701_125"]="I just wanted to tell you… I miss you… Aratos...",
  ["1003011701_127"]="Gently, Phaenomena pushes away the red-haired girl who has been holding her.",
  ["1003011701_128"]="The turbulence has long since faded. Night descends quietly—dreamlike and serene.",
  ["1003011701_129"]="…What's your name?",
  ["1003011701_13"]="A tinge of wistfulness and a hint of melancholy lingered within her.",
  ["1003011701_130"]="Aratos blinks, seemingly confused as to why Phaenomena would ask her such a question.",
  ["1003011701_131"]="She hesitates, then answers awkwardly with her own voice.",
  ["1003011701_132"]="A... Ara...tos...",
  ["1003011701_133"]="Phaenomena smiles.",
  ["1003011701_134"]="With that smile, tears stream down her face.",
  ["1003011701_136"]="The Astronomical Institute gracefully descends to the ground. The fractured terrain realigns seamlessly with the cracks left in its wake, like two puzzle pieces being reunited.",
  ["1003011701_137"]="As Ariadne guides Logos and the latest-generation Aratos down from the observatory, students from the other academies gather around them.",
  ["1003011701_138"]="Students from the Economics Academy start assessing damages; those from the Mechanics Academy immediately start repairs; the Medical students carefully place the wounded Aratos onto a stretcher. Everyone moved with practiced precision, tending to the aftermath of this \"major incident.\"",
  ["1003011701_139"]="Logos, take Aratos to the Medical Academy for treatment. Make sure to get yourself checked, too.",
  ["1003011701_14"]="So, she reached out toward the stars and kept singing...",
  ["1003011701_140"]="Sure, but… what about Dean Phaenomena?",
  ["1003011701_141"]="Ariadne turns to glance back at Phaenomena, who still stands alone in the center of the observatory, silently gazing up at the stars.",
  ["1003011701_142"]="Then, she turns again and addresses all the students, including Logos.",
  ["1003011701_143"]="Let's not disturb Dean Phaenomena for now. She needs some time alone. If there's anything you need to know or report, just come to me.",
  ["1003011701_145"]="Phaenomena stands alone at the center of the rooftop, gazing up at the star-filled sky above her.",
  ["1003011701_146"]="The stars intertwine across the heavens, each one whispering its own stories.",
  ["1003011701_147"]="A sensation unlike anything she has ever experienced wraps around her, a blend of profound loneliness and serene warmth.",
  ["1003011701_148"]="She feels alone, having finally understood the gap between herself and this world.",
  ["1003011701_149"]="And yet, she feels warm, for she is still hearing the \"noises\" of this universe.",
  ["1003011701_15"]="\"Come to me, my beautiful one. If you are destined to sink into the sea, why not alight in the palm of my hand?\"",
  ["1003011701_150"]="At long last, realization dawns upon her.",
  ["1003011701_151"]="The noise that has never left her ears for centuries—she eventually understands what it truly is.",
  ["1003011701_152"]="It is the tumultuous gravitational waves echoing throughout the universe.",
  ["1003011701_153"]="It is the subconscious roar from myriads of stars and galaxies in perpetual motion.",
  ["1003011701_154"]="Four billion years ago, amidst chaotic randomness, lightning, water vapor, and methane converged, giving birth to the first spark of life—the first amino acid.",
  ["1003011701_155"]="Such a process of creation applies just as well to the universe.",
  ["1003011701_156"]="Omnipresent gravity, entwined with the undulating gravitational waves, collide ceaselessly. Given enough time and patience, they too, will eventually ignite the spark of life.",
  ["1003011701_157"]="However, this form of \"life\" would manifest on a scale beyond comprehension.",
  ["1003011701_158"]="Stars and galaxies are its \"cells,\" and gravitational waves function as its primitive neural impulses, coursing through the fabric of space-time.",
  ["1003011701_159"]="As for the noise that echoes through the universe now, it is merely the surge of those impulses among the primordial cells, before any true \"thought\" has taken form.",
  ["1003011701_16"]="The tide carried her song to the moon, which relayed it to a passing voyager.",
  ["1003011701_160"]="Phaenomena raises her gaze. Silver stars appear against the violet canvas of the sky.",
  ["1003011701_161"]="The \"noise\" that has haunted her for thousands of years… finally comes to an end.",
  ["1003011701_162"]="She has at last discovered how to listen.",
  ["1003011701_163"]="To listen to the breathing of a \"child\" that has not yet opened its eyes.",
  ["1003011701_164"]="The universe before her eyes is a colossal, ever-growing entity, one still developing—a \"thinker\" destined to awaken one day.",
  ["1003011701_165"]="Gently, Phaenomena begins to hum Aratos's lullaby. For the first time, a question arises in her heart, one that belongs solely to her.",
  ["1003011701_166"]="Why did Aratos's song resonate with the gravitational waves of her homeland? How could a human voice possibly resonate with gravitational waves?",
  ["1003011701_167"]="And then, as if instinctively, she finds answers.",
  ["1003011701_168"]="If one were to describe that \"lullaby\" in human language, it would be no more and no less than a mother's song, sung for her nascent, beloved child.",
  ["1003011701_169"]="Now, Phaenomena sings that lullaby—not to her home, but to this universe.",
  ["1003011701_17"]="That voyager came from beyond even the universe itself.",
  ["1003011701_171"]="When one person asks another, \"Where is your home?\", the answer usually comes as a specific address—a location that narrows down from country to city, then to a particular street and door number.",
  ["1003011701_172"]="But perhaps one day, as our footsteps traverse the visible stars, the more accurate answer will begin with—",
  ["1003011701_173"]="Milky Way Galaxy, Orion Arm, Solar System, Earth… and only then a particular country on a particular continent.",
  ["1003011701_174"]="And perhaps one day, we may need to extend that prefix even further...",
  ["1003011701_175"]="Universe, Laniakea Supercluster, Virgo Cluster, Local Group… Then Milky Way, Orion Arm, Solar System, Earth...",
  ["1003011701_176"]="This will happen when we meet a visitor from another universe.",
  ["1003011701_177"]="Or when we ourselves visit another universe.",
  ["1003011701_178"]="...",
  ["1003011701_179"]="...",
  ["1003011701_18"]="So, on that fateful day, a star heeded the song, descending into the Nereus Sea.",
  ["1003011701_180"]="Yeah, I believe that day will come.",
  ["1003011701_181"]="Don't you think so?",
  ["1003011701_182"]="Lullaby",
  ["1003011701_2"]="Along the shores of the Nereus Sea.",
  ["1003011701_20"]="The star recalled an ancient memory buried deep in its mind.",
  ["1003011701_21"]="On that day, it plunged into the sea and walked onto the shore.",
  ["1003011701_22"]="Assuming a girl's form, it met the red-haired girl's gaze—like a reflection in a mirror.",
  ["1003011701_23"]="It could not comprehend her words or actions.",
  ["1003011701_24"]="Even now, it remembers only the shimmer in the girl's eyes and a string of syllables—",
  ["1003011701_25"]="<size=50><b>Phaenomena.</b></size>",
  ["1003011701_27"]="Phae... nom... ena.",
  ["1003011701_28"]="Aratos cradled Phaenomena tightly in her embrace.",
  ["1003011701_29"]="Come back, girl! She'll tear you apart!",
  ["1003011701_3"]="The sea was like a mirror.",
  ["1003011701_30"]="Aratos remains unperturbed. Although her fingers start to distort, she persists in gently caressing the nape of Phaenomena's neck, again and again.",
  ["1003011701_31"]="I'm here. I'm right here for you...",
  ["1003011701_33"]="For the first time, the face of this girl—both familiar and strange—comes clearly into Phaenomena's eyes.",
  ["1003011701_34"]="That entirely unfamiliar face becomes the final, inescapable confirmation of something Phaenomena has been evading.",
  ["1003011701_35"]="And then, more visages begin to surface in her mind, one after another.",
  ["1003011701_36"]="Hey there, Phaenomena! I'm Aratos!",
  ["1003011701_37"]="So, Phaenomena, where exactly do you come from?",
  ["1003011701_38"]="You belong to a different world, a more distant and beautiful one.",
  ["1003011701_39"]="I'm getting on in years, Phaenomena. I don't have the energy I used to.",
  ["1003011701_4"]="Starlight danced upon the waves, serenading with an ancient melody.",
  ["1003011701_40"]="Hahaha… My little star, you never fail to surprise me.",
  ["1003011701_41"]="Like a cascade of falling dominoes, the collapse of the first tile triggers the downfall of all the others.",
  ["1003011701_42"]="—My most beloved sister.",
  ["1003011701_43"]="—My most intimate playmate.",
  ["1003011701_44"]="—My most adorable little one.",
  ["1003011701_45"]="—My most cherished child.",
  ["1003011701_46"]="—My most yearned-for star.",
  ["1003011701_47"]="Each Aratos in Phaenomena's memory now has a \"face.\" &They are no longer abstract, symbolic entities, but vivid, tangible people.",
  ["1003011701_48"]="...",
  ["1003011701_49"]="Gahh...",
  ["1003011701_5"]="A red-haired girl hummed along with the rhythms of the tides, walking barefoot along the starlit shore.",
  ["1003011701_50"]="Tears well up in her eyes.",
  ["1003011701_51"]="A torrent of emotions, long stored silently in her heart, finally overflows, surging forth and tearing through her chest.",
  ["1003011701_53"]="There is a comet named Halley's Comet that circles the sun every seventy-six years.",
  ["1003011701_54"]="At aphelion, its nucleus lies dormant in ice, dim and silent.",
  ["1003011701_55"]="But as it approaches the sun, the ice dissipates, unleashing a resplendent, massive tail.",
  ["1003011701_56"]="...",
  ["1003011701_57"]="And here is another late-blooming little star.",
  ["1003011701_58"]="Only now does it realize—it has already orbited the sun, passing perihelion 104 times.",
  ["1003011701_59"]="The heat accumulated from those 104 orbits arrives belatedly, but in a sudden burst, it melts every last layer of ice.",
  ["1003011701_6"]="The white sand cradled her feet, the gentle waves caressing her bare toes.",
  ["1003011701_60"]="In the next moment, this star bursts forth with a brilliance unlike anything before.",
  ["1003011701_62"]="Ugh... ah… AAAAAAAHHHHHH—",
  ["1003011701_63"]="Phaenomena raises her head.",
  ["1003011701_64"]="Like a fledgling crying out to the sky for the first time.",
  ["1003011701_65"]="She wails, hoarse and raw, as if her heart is being torn apart.",
  ["1003011701_67"]="Amidst the endless field of white flowers—",
  ["1003011701_68"]="This is probably our last conversation.",
  ["1003011701_7"]="At times, she bent down to pick up shells from the sand.",
  ["1003011701_70"]="You are Phaenomena's home.",
  ["1003011701_71"]="If I were to put it in the terms of your civilization—yes.",
  ["1003011701_72"]="Or, you could call me by another name... the Universe.",
  ["1003011701_74"]="You're… a universe?",
  ["1003011701_75"]="I once was. Now… I am its lingering echo, an echo composed of gravitational waves.",
  ["1003011701_76"]="You… or rather, a part of you—somewhere in your body or deep within your mind… you are one of us.",
  ["1003011701_77"]="That's why you heard the ripples I left behind.",
  ["1003011701_78"]="I'm merely the echo of a universe that perished eons ago. And Phaenomena… she is a piece of me and, perhaps, my final child.",
  ["1003011701_79"]="When she left me, she had not yet awakened, like an infant in swaddling clothes.",
  ["1003011701_8"]="At other times, she stood tall, gazing at the Milky Way above.",
  ["1003011701_80"]="Her instincts allowed her to hear the gravitational waves that fill this universe, but she couldn't understand them.",
  ["1003011701_81"]="To her, they were immense, eternal, resounding, and unfamiliar sounds. Naturally, a child faced with such sounds would be scared.",
  ["1003011701_82"]="She had nothing but instinct; nothing but the ability to cry.",
  ["1003011701_83"]="As for your language, it was even more incomprehensible to her.",
  ["1003011701_84"]="What else could I do? All I could do was keep humming lullabies to her, hoping that she wouldn't be so scared, and that someone would be kind to her—to my youngest child.",
  ["1003011701_85"]="Thankfully, she recognized my voice, like a baby recognizes its mother's. But my voice was far too faint; she could only hear it when it resonated with the voices of other children.",
  ["1003011701_86"]="Now, I'm fading away.",
  ["1003011701_87"]="Ripples on the sea can travel very, very far, but the surface always returns to stillness in the end.",
  ["1003011701_88"]="I've sung every lullaby I could for her. Soon, even this final ripple I stirred in space-time will vanish, and every trace that I ever existed will be erased as well.",
  ["1003011701_89"]="I'm worried... Will she be able to face your universe on her own after my demise?",
  ["1003011701_9"]="The Milky Way stretched across the sky, like a blurred phosphorescent river flowing between the horizons.",
  ["1003011701_91"]="What melody can soothe her?",
  ["1003011701_92"]="It's not that complicated. It was never a specific melody…",
  ["1003011701_93"]="Those young ones thought it was a certain frequency in their lullabies that resonated with my voice, but it wasn't. As you see, young one, how could a human voice possibly resonate with gravitational waves? That was never what resonated…",
  ["1003011701_94"]="Go now. Sing to her in my place, and tell her something for me—",
  ["1003011701_96"]="Aratos feels as though she is embracing a star, and she would dissolve into nothingness in the next second.",
  ["1003011701_97"]="What else could she do to stop all of this? To protect Phaenomena from destroying herself?",
  ["1003011701_98"]="In a trance, she seems to hear someone whispering in her ears—",
  ["1003011801_1"]="Other than the cold floor and drifting dust, there is nothing here.",
  ["1003011801_10"]="The only solace is the skylight above your head.",
  ["1003011801_100"]="The doll suddenly looks up at the sky.",
  ["1003011801_101"]="Ariadne has begun to dive... we'll meet again soon.",
  ["1003011801_103"]="Wait!",
  ["1003011801_104"]="What am I supposed to do?",
  ["1003011801_105"]="...",
  ["1003011801_106"]="The doll no longer responds, and the girl lets out a faint, animal-like snore.",
  ["1003011801_107"]="Don't worry. Aria hasn't abandoned you.",
  ["1003011801_108"]="Following the voice, a beam of light pours through the overcast clouds, outlining a faint feminine figure in the void.",
  ["1003011801_109"]="Though I can't make out her features, I can sense the sincerity in her words.",
  ["1003011801_11"]="The pale moonlight pours straight down, drawing a line of light—inviting one to look upward.",
  ["1003011801_110"]="Please, take hold of the thread in the doll's hand.",
  ["1003011801_111"]="It will guide you... through the Labyrinth.",
  ["1003011801_13"]="So bright.",
  ["1003011801_14"]="This doesn't look like moonlight.",
  ["1003011801_15"]="Light—an azure curtain connecting heaven and earth—far surpasses the brightness the moon should emit.",
  ["1003011801_16"]="It reminds you of things you shouldn't be remembering now. A staircase. A ritual... A disaster.",
  ["1003011801_18"]="Zero once said Delphi lies in that direction.",
  ["1003011801_20"]="Could it be...",
  ["1003011801_21"]="However, the moment that thought emerges, your mind begins to blur, like ink dropped into water.",
  ["1003011801_22"]="You hear a chaotic whisper near your ear. Your breathing slows, syncing with the rise and fall of that pillar of light.",
  ["1003011801_23"]="A sudden drowsiness—like an invisible string—gently pulls your eyelids down.",
  ["1003011801_25"]="No...",
  ["1003011801_26"]="I mustn't fall asleep...",
  ["1003011801_28"]="You shake your head, trying to drive away the drowsiness.",
  ["1003011801_3"]="...",
  ["1003011801_30"]="...!",
  ["1003011801_31"]="But when you open your eyes again, an entirely different scene unfolds before you.",
  ["1003011801_32"]="Dim, desolate, decayed.",
  ["1003011801_33"]="Withered branches hang from shattered columns, and broken paths are covered in moss. Looking around, it feels like stepping into a garden forgotten for a thousand years.",
  ["1003011801_34"]="But within the gloom, a small glimmer of gold floats in the air, softly flickering toward me.",
  ["1003011801_35"]="Before the blonde girl can speak, the doll in her arms opens its mouth.",
  ["1003011801_36"]="Greetings, lost one...",
  ["1003011801_38"]="Where am I?",
  ["1003011801_39"]="Who are you?",
  ["1003011801_4"]="You struggle to open your eyes.",
  ["1003011801_40"]="I am Aria—or more precisely, a fragment of her consciousness lingering in this doll... Hmm... No, that's not right.",
  ["1003011801_41"]="Ariadne hasn't fallen asleep yet. How did you enter this labyrinth?",
  ["1003011801_43"]="Dean Ariadne, the rotor-wing device from the Mechanics Academy has arrived. We may proceed to the lifting platform.",
  ["1003011801_44"]="Then go ahead, Logos. I have other crucial matters to attend to.",
  ["1003011801_45"]="But Dean Ariadne, the situation at the Astronomical Academy is worsening. I fear we can't afford...",
  ["1003011801_46"]="Logos, belated reflection surpasses reckless endeavors.",
  ["1003011801_47"]="The Astronomical Academy has already lifted off. Setting foot aboard means severing ties with the city below.",
  ["1003011801_48"]="We must make full preparations before departure.",
  ["1003011801_49"]="Besides, if I'm not mistaken, the rotor-wing device still needs adjustment before launch, right?",
  ["1003011801_5"]="Unfortunately, the fatigue and soreness have not faded with sleep—they still linger in every joint of your body.",
  ["1003011801_50"]="Yes. According to Mechanics Academy protocols, about twenty minutes of calibration are required before liftoff.",
  ["1003011801_51"]="Good. That should be enough for me.",
  ["1003011801_52"]="Go assist them with the adjustments, Logos. I'll make it there before liftoff.",
  ["1003011801_54"]="She sits in her office chair, unconsciously rubbing her fingertips along the edge of her cup.",
  ["1003011801_55"]="The coffee has long lost its aroma, yet Ariadne still makes no move to pick up the cup. Her gaze remains fixed on the documents before her.",
  ["1003011801_56"]="As she gazes at the reports sent by the other deans, the arguments from the previous meeting flood back to her.",
  ["1003011801_57"]="We simply need to convert the academy into a sealed, extraterrestrial biosphere before it leaves the atmosphere, then it will turn into a spacecraft for colonization.",
  ["1003011801_58"]="The Military Academy proposes that we immediately deploy all ground forces to destroy the Astronomical Academy before it breaks through the atmosphere. We must crush the culprit and their schemes once and for all!",
  ["1003011801_59"]="Only those dim-witted Japhethians from two thousand years before the World Calendar would propose such a method. If we must bring down the Astronomical Academy, I have a far better solution.",
  ["1003011801_6"]="Auctions, accidents, confinement... After such a long day, your sense of time has dulled.",
  ["1003011801_60"]="Stop! Have you all forgotten that the Astronomical Academy is a part of Delphi's assets?",
  ["1003011801_61"]="...",
  ["1003011801_62"]="People often say that gathering the world's geniuses is like catching falling stars with bare hands.",
  ["1003011801_63"]="It's probably because this was so hard to accomplish that people ignored something even more challenging.",
  ["1003011801_64"]="—How to make those self-willed stars work together under one roof, that is.",
  ["1003011801_65"]="With that thought, she raises her cup and takes a sip.",
  ["1003011801_66"]="The coffee slides down her throat—cold, but slightly eases her weariness.",
  ["1003011801_67"]="Each of them is an undisputed genius, unmatched in their own field. But conversely... that insight that defines them also traps them in their own valleys, creating blind spots of their own.",
  ["1003011801_68"]="Each dean's proposal carried its own feasibility and intent, yet none could truly resolve the Astronomical Academy's current predicament.",
  ["1003011801_69"]="Before the official launch, perhaps it's time to gather my thoughts... using those deans' suggestions as a guide.",
  ["1003011801_7"]="Perhaps a few minutes have passed, perhaps hours. You can't tell. You only know that compared to before you fell asleep, the darkness around you has thickened into something suffocating.",
  ["1003011801_70"]="She pushes aside the teacup in front of her. While the scent of coffee still lingers, she slowly closes her eyes.",
  ["1003011801_71"]="The light recedes from the room like an ebbing tide, and the outlines of objects begin to blur.",
  ["1003011801_72"]="The documents on the desk, the surrounding walls, and even the chairs and table she is leaning on gradually dissolve into this murky haze.",
  ["1003011801_73"]="Just as her thoughts are about to drift, a faint crease appears between her brows—",
  ["1003011801_74"]="For in this realm of thought, another's consciousness is beginning to rise.",
  ["1003011801_75"]="It seems she is not the only one diving today.",
  ["1003011801_76"]="Aria, who are you speaking to?",
  ["1003011801_78"]="The boundless ash engulfs her vision.",
  ["1003011801_79"]="Shadows and dust creep between the ruins, crawling like some living thing.",
  ["1003011801_80"]="The golden thread connecting the girl becomes the only guide in her hand. Without it, she would have surely lost her way within a few turns.",
  ["1003011801_81"]="Thinking this, she slows her steps.",
  ["1003011801_83"]="So...",
  ["1003011801_85"]="What is this place, exactly?",
  ["1003011801_86"]="This is the Labyrinth of Reverie—the courtyard where thinkers linger.",
  ["1003011801_87"]="Perception and thoughts are amplified to an unlimited extent here, echoing endlessly within the labyrinth.",
  ["1003011801_89"]="But how did I end up here?",
  ["1003011801_9"]="...",
  ["1003011801_90"]="Well, let me see your thoughts.",
  ["1003011801_91"]="A city blooming with myriad flowers, an eternally slumbering dragon, a collapsed tower, and...",
  ["1003011801_92"]="Ah, so you are the master of that tower. It seems you will be a distinguished guest of Ariadne's. Hmm... then I should show more respect... perhaps I should address you as the \"Head Librarian\"?",
  ["1003011801_94"]="...Stop prying into my thoughts!",
  ["1003011801_95"]="Are you reading my memories through these corridors?",
  ["1003011801_96"]="Pardon me. I didn't mean to... I just wanted to know more about you.",
  ["1003011801_97"]="Technically, this is merely a more direct way of communicating with you.",
  ["1003011801_98"]="However... although your consciousness has reached here, your body still sleeps in a small room outside the labyrinth.",
  ["1003011801_99"]="If that's the case, perhaps it's not too dangerous yet...",
  ["1003011901_1"]="The paths of the labyrinth twist and extend like some distorted blood vessel. Direction has lost all meaning here.",
  ["1003011901_10"]="The Grand Oracle.",
  ["1003011901_11"]="It is clearly just a shadow, yet as I gaze at it, a name rises to my mind instinctively.",
  ["1003011901_12"]="Excellent. It seems you've experienced the Labyrinth of Reverie for yourself.",
  ["1003011901_14"]="Now I see what you've been thinking about.",
  ["1003011901_15"]="The shadow trembles slightly as if it were offering a faint smile.",
  ["1003011901_16"]="The Labyrinth of Reverie is a space constructed upon reality, yet it defies all logical constraints of reality.",
  ["1003011901_17"]="Here, one's inspiration and thoughts are endlessly magnified, extended, even beyond the limits of reason.",
  ["1003011901_18"]="Questions entangled in the real world often find unexpected clarity within these walls.",
  ["1003011901_2"]="Though the girl slumbers, the golden thread continues to guide me.",
  ["1003011901_20"]="Then why did I end up here?",
  ["1003011901_21"]="That... was my oversight. I apologize.",
  ["1003011901_22"]="I opened the Labyrinth to sort out some trifling matters...",
  ["1003011901_23"]="I never imagined it would draw you in as well.",
  ["1003011901_25"]="Can I leave this place?",
  ["1003011901_26"]="Of course, but please give me a bit more time.",
  ["1003011901_27"]="I opened the Labyrinth for contemplation.",
  ["1003011901_28"]="Once I finish thinking, I'll return to the surface—and bring you back with me.",
  ["1003011901_3"]="As I wander through the tangled corridors, countless thoughts spread through my mind, as though I were drifting through the minds of others.",
  ["1003011901_30"]="Will it take long?",
  ["1003011901_31"]="Please don't worry. Just like dreams blur the sense of time, the flow of time in the Labyrinth of Reverie is also subjective.",
  ["1003011901_32"]="What's more, the one wandering here is merely a fragment of your consciousness. You yourself—your true thoughts—are not trapped here.",
  ["1003011901_33"]="This is merely a fleeting dream, and nothing more. Even though it feels like we've been talking for ages here, in reality, only a few seconds might have passed.",
  ["1003011901_34"]="When my thoughts reach their conclusion, your dream will also end.",
  ["1003011901_36"]="Perhaps... I can help you organize those thoughts?",
  ["1003011901_37"]="Much appreciated.",
  ["1003011901_38"]="Then please proceed in the way you're most comfortable with.",
  ["1003011901_39"]="At this point, Ariadne pauses slightly.",
  ["1003011901_4"]="Delphi, the Grand Oracle, the deans, the Astronomical Academy, and even that scholar, Logos, who once visited CangLin City...",
  ["1003011901_40"]="But there's one thing I must ask you to be especially mindful of.",
  ["1003011901_41"]="No matter what kind of scenery you encounter... make sure you hold tightly to the golden thread Aria gave you.",
  ["1003011901_5"]="All these images flash through my mind, until... I encounter that golden silhouette once more.",
  ["1003011901_7"]="...",
  ["1003011901_9"]="...Ariadne.",
  ["1003012001_1"]="You awaken beneath the colonnade's shadow.",
  ["1003012001_10"]="Has her personality changed somehow?",
  ["1003012001_11"]="...",
  ["1003012001_12"]="As her thoughts deepen, the doll in her hands changes along with her mental state.",
  ["1003012001_13"]="Now, please stay patient and let this child finish the story.",
  ["1003012001_14"]="Ahem... shall I continue?",
  ["1003012001_15"]="You stroll through the Astronomical Academy. Students whisper anxiously around you, and amidst their excitement and worry, you start to grasp the current situation.",
  ["1003012001_16"]="The launch of the Astronomical Academy is now inevitable. No academy has the technological means to alter that outcome.",
  ["1003012001_17"]="And so, the thinkers below proposed a bold plan—let the Astronomical Academy ascend into space as it is. Before it completely breaches the atmosphere, the Medical and Mechanics Academies will work together to transform it into a self-contained extraterrestrial biosphere.",
  ["1003012001_19"]="That's just giving up!",
  ["1003012001_2"]="You've missed the final evacuation window. The last batch of rotor-wing devices has already vanished into the clouds, unreachable now.",
  ["1003012001_20"]="Would the Society really approve such a plan?",
  ["1003012001_21"]="In Delphi, this kind of proposal isn't entirely outrageous... at least its feasibility isn't zero.",
  ["1003012001_22"]="Probably not. The doll's story is, after all, hypothetical.",
  ["1003012001_23"]="In your opinion, what challenges must be overcome to travel in space?",
  ["1003012001_25"]="Spacecraft?",
  ["1003012001_26"]="Rocket fuel?",
  ["1003012001_27"]="You're right—carriers and propulsion are essential topics in space travel.",
  ["1003012001_28"]="The farther a rocket travels, the more fuel it needs. But more fuel means more weight, and more weight means even more fuel is needed to lift it.",
  ["1003012001_29"]="...And now, the Astronomical Academy has completely overcome the limitations of energy conversion efficiency. For those seeking interstellar travel, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.",
  ["1003012001_3"]="The Astronomical Academy is about to break through the stratosphere, and yet, for some reason, the pain that once came with every breath has now faded away.",
  ["1003012001_30"]="The doll in the girl's hand gives a small nod and continues the narration.",
  ["1003012001_31"]="The ground beneath your feet begins to tremble.",
  ["1003012001_32"]="Outside the dome, the atmosphere is igniting. Violet flames tear at the sky resemble the fangs of a giant beast—space is just one step away.",
  ["1003012001_33"]="But those who remain behind are still restless. Even now, scholars from the Medical Academy and engineers from the Mechanics Academy haven't reached an agreement.",
  ["1003012001_34"]="The medics advocate for turning the Astronomical Academy into an ark—one that sails into deep space, carrying traces of humanity to the stars.",
  ["1003012001_35"]="But the engineers refuse a one-way voyage. They aim to forge the Astronomical Academy into an ever-awake colossus—its gears and steel countering every force exerted on it. They wish to travel across gravity and stars... and return home one day.",
  ["1003012001_36"]="There's no time left for hesitation. Supplies and manpower are limited. All unresolved matters must be decided before the academy breaches the atmosphere.",
  ["1003012001_37"]="According to the Oracle, all major matters in the Academy City must follow the will of the people—even in the sky. This final sacred vote now rests in your hands.",
  ["1003012001_39"]="Cast your vote for the Medical Academy.",
  ["1003012001_4"]="The wind carries the scent of crude oil and disinfectant. You look up, only now realizing that above you is no longer the ever-closing sky, but a crystallizing dome.",
  ["1003012001_40"]="Cast your vote for the Mechanics Academy.",
  ["1003012001_41"]="...",
  ["1003012001_42"]="The medics gaze silently at the shrinking planet. In their eyes, it is not so much longing as a sacred sense of duty.",
  ["1003012001_43"]="The dome of the Astronomical Academy gleams under the starlight. Forests cultivated by medics bloom with emerald life amid the galaxy—genetically edited trees grow rapidly, and bees marked with fluorescent tags carve golden trails through the flowers.",
  ["1003012001_44"]="The Astronomical Academy is like a seed flung into deep space. It may never reach the end of this arduous journey, and someday it might turn to dust in the cosmos. But at the very least... It will leave behind a uniquely human trace in the sea of stars—Hope.",
  ["1003012001_46"]="...",
  ["1003012001_47"]="If the current academy is a gargantuan beast, then industry is its lifeblood.",
  ["1003012001_48"]="Twenty Earth years have slipped by. The Astronomical Academy's structure has been completely reshaped—its courtyards and buildings reorganized into parts of a composite propulsion system.",
  ["1003012001_49"]="Mining units, like iron-forged worker ants, gnaw away at the asteroid belt, transporting minerals to a massive furnace at the center. As the minerals dissolve, the sound of fiery liquid flows throughout the academy—like the pulse of a steel colossus.",
  ["1003012001_5"]="It's an industrial product developed jointly by the Mechanics and Medical Academies—a substance somewhere between glass and ice. It's sealing the entire academy in amber as final preparation for the coming vacuum.",
  ["1003012001_50"]="Day after day, month after month, the furnace will burn like Hephaestus's fire—eternally, until this odyssey reaches its end.",
  ["1003012001_51"]="Earth is the cradle of reason, but humanity cannot remain in the cradle forever.",
  ["1003012001_52"]="No matter which path you chose, congratulations are in order—you've borne witness to history. As a member of Delphi, you've carried the torch of human civilization into space.",
  ["1003012001_53"]="Whether it becomes dust among the stars, a tombstone in deep space, or perhaps... truly a seed.",
  ["1003012001_54"]="In a future light-years away, it will surely meet those who follow in pursuit... once again.",
  ["1003012001_56"]="...",
  ["1003012001_58"]="Their yearning for space really is intense.",
  ["1003012001_59"]="Because the mysteries of the Astronomical Academy stem from the stars.",
  ["1003012001_60"]="Just like Delphi's other academies, the Astronomical Academy houses many anomalous entities.",
  ["1003012001_61"]="Most of these anomalies are extraterrestrial, having inspired countless scholars throughout history... One might even say that, aside from the satellites floating in near-Earth orbit, this academy is the closest place humanity has to the cosmos.",
  ["1003012001_63"]="If this plan is really carried out...",
  ["1003012001_65"]="Will they succeed?",
  ["1003012001_66"]="...",
  ["1003012001_67"]="Whether it's the Delphi Astronomical Academy or Cyril's space agency, their understanding of the universe is still far too shallow.",
  ["1003012001_68"]="Even if we eliminate all calculation errors and theoretical flaws, humanity's current model of the universe is based solely on what we've observed of the known cosmos.",
  ["1003012001_69"]="If the Astronomical Academy truly escapes the atmosphere and ventures into deep space... it would effortlessly cross the boundaries of humanity's cosmic understanding.",
  ["1003012001_7"]="Why is this story told in the second person?",
  ["1003012001_70"]="What comes after that... perhaps only the ancient gods who once visited Delphi would know.",
  ["1003012001_71"]="...Assuming, of course, that those gods are still alive?",
  ["1003012001_8"]="Because Ariadne once said it creates a sense of epic narrative, helping listeners immerse themselves in the experience.",
  ["1003012101_1"]="Too late. Everything is... far too late.",
  ["1003012101_10"]="Both the Finance and Philosophy Academies take conservative stances. They hope the Society can adopt measured actions that won't endanger students' lives or compromise academy assets.",
  ["1003012101_12"]="...Sounds fairly reasonable.",
  ["1003012101_13"]="Five points. You've noticed the surface, but failed to grasp the deeper cause.",
  ["1003012101_14"]="The Finance and Philosophy Academies are vested interests. Of course, they want to maintain the status quo. Their so-called caution and prudence stem from the fear that if something terrible happens to the Astronomical Academy, they'll suffer direct losses.",
  ["1003012101_15"]="The Finance Academy has established a precise and elaborate framework around the Astronomical Academy's assets and equipment, issuing a series of subordinated bonds and mortgage loans. They even set up an Astrological Observation Fund for it.",
  ["1003012101_16"]="If the Astronomical Academy truly escapes Earth's gravity and ascends into space—what do you think will happen to the Finance Academy?",
  ["1003012101_18"]="A massive, unexplainable loss.",
  ["1003012101_19"]="A convenient excuse to \"write off\" the debt?",
  ["1003012101_2"]="When the Astronomical Academy shed the shackles of gravity and became a floating archipelago, this disaster could no longer be resolved by conventional means.",
  ["1003012101_20"]="Eight points. The scale of such a loss would be too great for even the Finance Academy to absorb smoothly.",
  ["1003012101_21"]="Zero points... The collective unconsciousness might blur the reality of the Astronomical Academy's ascension, but it cannot blur the solid numbers on a balance sheet.",
  ["1003012101_22"]="This entire cluster of financial assets under the Finance Academy would become worthless paper—there wouldn't even be a chance to sell them off.",
  ["1003012101_23"]="And that's not even the worst part.",
  ["1003012101_24"]="Even if the Finance Academy patched the hole, sharp-eyed credit rating agencies and Polestar speculators would quickly spot this untraceable super bad debt.",
  ["1003012101_25"]="The resulting chain reaction... could very well spark the next financial crisis.",
  ["1003012101_27"]="Now I understand why the Finance Academy would act.",
  ["1003012101_29"]="But what's the Philosophy Academy's concern?",
  ["1003012101_3"]="As long as the acceleration imposed on the Astronomical Academy remains irreversible, information control and diplomatic methods will eventually reach their limits. At that point...",
  ["1003012101_30"]="Six points. You've raised a point, but overlooked a basic truth. The Philosophy Academy is Delphi's...",
  ["1003012101_31"]="...",
  ["1003012101_32"]="Well, as the Dean of the Philosophy Academy, allow me to answer this myself.",
  ["1003012101_33"]="Even back in the days when Japheth was still an empire, Philosophos had already begun overseeing all academies in the Academy Nation.",
  ["1003012101_35"]="Why the Philosophy Academy, specifically?",
  ["1003012101_36"]="The scholars of Delphi have always followed one creed: Philosophy is the origin of all knowledge in the world. Thus, the right to govern the Academic City must fall to the Philosophy Academy.",
  ["1003012101_37"]="—At least, that's the official explanation.",
  ["1003012101_38"]="In truth... the other academies simply aren't interested in \"governance\" to begin with.",
  ["1003012101_40"]="Scholars really are a quirky bunch.",
  ["1003012101_41"]="Reminds me of Eme-an...",
  ["1003012101_42"]="Maintaining operations, establishing rules, mediating conflicts, and managing crises...",
  ["1003012101_43"]="Running a city is no simple task—let alone one like Delphi, which houses numerous anomalies.",
  ["1003012101_44"]="Faced with endless daily responsibilities, the scholars of Delphi would rather spend their time in pursuit of knowledge and truth.",
  ["1003012101_45"]="However, unrestrained brilliance can be more dangerous than foolishness. Someone has to bear the responsibility of leading Delphi.",
  ["1003012101_46"]="...In the end, that duty fell to us \"scatterbrained\" philosophers and thinkers.",
  ["1003012101_48"]="Sounds like a tough job.",
  ["1003012101_49"]="Ariadne nods, donning a bitter smile.",
  ["1003012101_5"]="Compared to the other manifestations of thoughts...",
  ["1003012101_50"]="That's why I'm here.",
  ["1003012101_51"]="The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. If the Astronomical Academy truly spirals out of control, the damage won't stop at just property or casualties.",
  ["1003012101_52"]="Whether it's rebuilding the Astronomical Academy afterward or resettling the scholars and students, \"the Astronomical Academy ascending into space\" will forever reshape Delphi's perception.",
  ["1003012101_54"]="Will people... panic?",
  ["1003012101_55"]="Will people... rejoice?",
  ["1003012101_56"]="Three points. Only fools will panic.",
  ["1003012101_57"]="Nine points... Clearly, you understand—what draws people from all over the world to Delphi is their pursuit of knowledge.",
  ["1003012101_58"]="Once the fear fades... obsession with the stars and the thirst for the unknown will spread like wildfire across the prairie, filling every heart.",
  ["1003012101_59"]="From individuals to groups, to organizations, even to entire academies... they will all scramble to imitate it, doing everything in their power to break free of gravity's chains.",
  ["1003012101_6"]="She seems more pessimistic.",
  ["1003012101_60"]="It's not hard to imagine. Delphi will split into two factions: knowledge of the earth, and knowledge of the heavens. Then we'll see the same old dramas repeating over and over again in human history.",
  ["1003012101_61"]="Perhaps, in the end, this will become the final straw that breaks Delphi apart, splitting our fragile academic community once and for all.",
  ["1003012101_62"]="...",
  ["1003012101_63"]="We won't let it come to that.",
  ["1003012101_7"]="Seven points... These judgments contain no personal emotion. I'm simply making the most realistic assessment based on facts.",
  ["1003012101_8"]="That's probably because this manifestation contains the caution of the Finance Academy and the reasoning of the Philosophy Academy.",
  ["1003012101_9"]="Among all the whimsical and unbridled academies, they're the only ones who still value temperance and prudence.",
  ["1003012201_1"]="Calculating coordinates for the Astronomical Academy.",
  ["1003012201_10"]="In fact, intelligence officers from the Military Academy discovered traces of Nemesis aboard the academy. They believe that Nemesis is the one behind this launch.",
  ["1003012201_11"]="Whatever purpose Nemesis holds, whatever scheme is at play, we must crush it before it matures—no mercy.",
  ["1003012201_12"]="As planned, they'll deploy lasers, kinetic strikes, and even experimental orbital weapons to target the academy's real-time movement. A staggered assault will be conducted at varying altitudes.",
  ["1003012201_14"]="What about the assets onboard the academy?",
  ["1003012201_15"]="To quote the war consultants—\"Destructive force is also a metric in live combat training.\"",
  ["1003012201_17"]="...",
  ["1003012201_18"]="That said, the Mathematics Academy has proposed a more \"precise\" alternative.",
  ["1003012201_19"]="Rather than unleashing all weapons, they propose placing explosives at critical points across the floating isles before the academy reaches full altitude.",
  ["1003012201_2"]="Gravitational compensation calibrated. Target is expected to enter the designated trajectory in five minutes.",
  ["1003012201_20"]="According to their orbital dynamics model, a carefully timed detonation—combined with targeted external strikes—could redistribute momentum using near-Earth satellite collisions.",
  ["1003012201_21"]="If their estimates are accurate, some of the academy's remnants would stabilize into orbit, becoming a satellite around Earth. Recovery could then proceed at the Society's discretion.",
  ["1003012201_23"]="What if the estimate is wrong?",
  ["1003012201_24"]="The Mathematics Academy will likely initiate a series of new simulations and recalculations in response.",
  ["1003012201_25"]="Even though both the Mathematics and Finance Academies deal with numbers, the former rarely concerns itself with financial losses.",
  ["1003012201_27"]="But that's not the point!",
  ["1003012201_28"]="Warning: Target's acceleration exceeds expectations. Predicted to enter ballistic trajectory early.",
  ["1003012201_29"]="Reconfirming: Fire control command systems are fully synchronized. Command chain is operational.",
  ["1003012201_3"]="Ballistic calculations complete. Attention, all combat personnel. Please connect to the remote firepower terminals immediately.",
  ["1003012201_30"]="Mathematics and Military Academy students are fully prepared and ready for combat deployment.",
  ["1003012201_31"]="Time is running out, Head Librarian. Please issue the order!",
  ["1003012201_33"]="Got it.",
  ["1003012201_34"]="Do I really have to choose between these two?",
  ["1003012201_35"]="The doll in the girl's arms looks at you with reverence.",
  ["1003012201_36"]="The terminal's timer is ticking forward, silently pressing for a decision.",
  ["1003012201_38"]="...",
  ["1003012201_4"]="Ground artillery network, aerospace deployment units, and orbital kinetic matrices are now synchronizing ammunition loads. Launch readiness expected within one minute!",
  ["1003012201_40"]="Execute the Mathematics Academy's plan.",
  ["1003012201_41"]="Insert the Military Academy's war chip.",
  ["1003012201_42"]="Countdown complete. Explosives planted across the Astronomical Academy detonate in a precise sequence.",
  ["1003012201_43"]="You and the scholars from the Mathematics Academy stand silently at the observation deck, watching as formulas once penned on paper manifest through explosions.",
  ["1003012201_44"]="Towers, courtyards, and buildings collapse along pre-calculated fault lines in an orderly chain reaction.",
  ["1003012201_45"]="When a mathematician decides to destroy something, even the fall of its dust is subject to calculation—now you truly understand that.",
  ["1003012201_46"]="Blinding artillery lights up the sky. Amidst the saturated bombardment, the Astronomical Academy crumbles like a fragile paper model.",
  ["1003012201_47"]="And yet... one star remains untouched—perhaps a spire, or maybe an observatory. It escapes the bombardment and surges into deep space, undeterred.",
  ["1003012201_48"]="However, that does not matter anymore.",
  ["1003012201_49"]="From today on, every military textbook will record this operation. Your name will forever be tied to this new form of warfare—a chapter in the history of space combat.",
  ["1003012201_50"]="Staring at the debris scattered in orbit, you can't help but murmur.",
  ["1003012201_52"]="Was the price... too high?",
  ["1003012201_53"]="...",
  ["1003012201_54"]="There is no cost too great—especially when we have no other choice.",
  ["1003012201_55"]="Throughout Delphi's history, its greatest tragedies haven't stemmed from ignorance—",
  ["1003012201_56"]="But from people seeing disaster on the horizon, choosing to close their eyes... and then paying an even greater price when it's too late.",
  ["1003012201_57"]="While both the Military and Mathematics Academies' proposals are imperfect, their thinking is not without merit.",
  ["1003012201_58"]="No matter how valuable the Astronomical Academy is—how tangled its implications—it is, at its core, still just one of Delphi's many branches.",
  ["1003012201_59"]="Exactly! Entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity!",
  ["1003012201_6"]="What's going on here?",
  ["1003012201_60"]="What's the point of hesitating? It's already heading to space—just slice it off like a wheel of cheese!",
  ["1003012201_62"]="This approach feels too... extreme.",
  ["1003012201_63"]="The Delphic Oracle was founded to safeguard worldly order from anomalies.",
  ["1003012201_64"]="All of this... is only a hypothetical simulation. Measures like this would only be enacted under the most desperate of circumstances.",
  ["1003012201_66"]="Even if it means turning the academy into a satellite?",
  ["1003012201_67"]="Even if it means blasting the academy to dust?",
  ["1003012201_68"]="No.",
  ["1003012201_69"]="That would be... the safest, most \"harmless\" approach.",
  ["1003012201_7"]="Is this war?",
  ["1003012201_8"]="If the plan is to dismantle the academy's main structure before it breaks through the atmosphere, the firepower required would indeed rival that of a full-scale war.",
  ["1003012201_9"]="The moment we confirmed something had gone wrong with the Astronomical Academy, scholars from the Mathematics Academy and advisors from the Military Academy immediately provided a set of countermeasures.",
  ["1003012301_1"]="...",
  ["1003012301_10"]="They now seem almost as simple as arithmetic. As if, long ago, I once possessed this near-omniscient understanding.",
  ["1003012301_11"]="Besides Phaenomena, no one else can hear my voice, but you seem to be an exception.",
  ["1003012301_12"]="If I could just get closer—just one more step—I could hear it clearly... that melody from another world.",
  ["1003012301_13"]="Just as I am about to succumb, that familiar golden thread appears again...",
  ["1003012301_16"]="...",
  ["1003012301_17"]="Phew, I managed to pull you back.",
  ["1003012301_18"]="Okay, I'm going back to sleep now...",
  ["1003012301_19"]="Next time, don't do anything so dangerous, alright?",
  ["1003012301_2"]="At some point, Ariadne's figure has drifted far into the distance.",
  ["1003012301_21"]="Wait a moment...",
  ["1003012301_22"]="What... is this place?",
  ["1003012301_23"]="We're still inside the Labyrinth of Reverie.",
  ["1003012301_24"]="Only just now, it revealed more of its true form to you.",
  ["1003012301_25"]="I finally notice that at some point, the labyrinth has unveiled its original form.",
  ["1003012301_26"]="Twisting, coiling, layered like a cerebral cortex.",
  ["1003012301_28"]="...This maze is alive.",
  ["1003012301_3"]="I vaguely hear something... like a chant.",
  ["1003012301_30"]="It's forcing me to think.",
  ["1003012301_31"]="You're sharp.",
  ["1003012301_32"]="But allow me to clarify—whether it's help or coercion, the Labyrinth of Reverie doesn't possess subjective intent. That's a projection from our understanding.",
  ["1003012301_33"]="Just like planetary orbits or solar combustion—magnifying human thoughts is simply its instinct.",
  ["1003012301_34"]="Just as you said, the Labyrinth of Reverie is alive. It's always thinking.",
  ["1003012301_36"]="Why does it think?",
  ["1003012301_37"]="What is it thinking about?",
  ["1003012301_38"]="The sages of Delphi asked those questions millennia ago. But even now, we have no answer.",
  ["1003012301_39"]="All we know is that it engages in some kind of activity related to consciousness and thought... As we wander within it, we are drifting through the \"thoughts\" of the labyrinth itself.",
  ["1003012301_4"]="You shouldn't exist within this \"ripple.\" Who are you?",
  ["1003012301_40"]="But the labyrinth doesn't comprehend limits. It instinctively amplifies and extends human thought... even beyond the limits of the physical body.",
  ["1003012301_41"]="That's why the more intelligent and perceptive one is, the deeper they sink into the labyrinth.",
  ["1003012301_43"]="And then... what happens?",
  ["1003012301_44"]="Without Aria's guidance... they'd likely forget their very humanity amid endless contemplation... and become one with the labyrinth.",
  ["1003012301_45"]="Throughout history, many sages and philosophers have paid a painful price for it. That's why the Delphic Oracle sealed all conventional pathways to the Labyrinth of Reverie, strictly forbidding anyone from entering.",
  ["1003012301_46"]="That's also why, aside from you, no one else has ever set foot here.",
  ["1003012301_47"]="At this point, Ariadne turns to look at me.",
  ["1003012301_49"]="Just now... I think I heard something.",
  ["1003012301_5"]="...",
  ["1003012301_50"]="What kind of sound?",
  ["1003012301_52"]="Wind.",
  ["1003012301_53"]="Stars.",
  ["1003012301_54"]="A song.",
  ["1003012301_55"]="...",
  ["1003012301_56"]="Right now, I'm within the ascending Astronomical Academy.",
  ["1003012301_57"]="I see. I did wonder why your consciousness had strayed here... Perhaps your consciousness was touched by the resonance of some great existence, and during your drifting, the labyrinth lured you in.",
  ["1003012301_59"]="How are things over there?",
  ["1003012301_6"]="A voice.",
  ["1003012301_60"]="More complicated than I initially expected.",
  ["1003012301_61"]="The details—why don't we talk as we walk through the labyrinth?",
  ["1003012301_7"]="A voice so clear.",
  ["1003012301_8"]="Okay, I believe you. I'll just consider you a stone accidentally caught in this \"ripple.\"",
  ["1003012301_9"]="Those things that transcend sensory limits, unsolved mysteries, and forgotten truths...",
  ["1003012401_1"]="A girl ran with light steps, white flowers swaying beside the ancient stone path, brushing against her long red hair.",
  ["1003012401_10"]="The girl knew her appearance could not compare to the nobles in Japheth, nor her mind to the scholars of the Society.",
  ["1003012401_11"]="Her singing voice was not enchanting either—only when she plucked the strings of her lyre did people sometimes notice her.",
  ["1003012401_12"]="So she thought and thought, but no matter how hard she tried, she could not understand—",
  ["1003012401_13"]="\"How could someone so ordinary as me have any right to become Aratos?\"",
  ["1003012401_14"]="The Grand Oracle turned slightly, her face showing neither joy nor sorrow, and simply said.",
  ["1003012401_15"]="\"Because you are as pure as a blank page—untouched by the world's turmoil, unmeasured by the spindle of fate.\"",
  ["1003012401_17"]="The colors the girl bears bring back memories of the voices I once heard.",
  ["1003012401_18"]="She, too, once called herself... Aratos.",
  ["1003012401_2"]="That was the day she would become Aratos.",
  ["1003012401_20"]="Is this the selection of Aratos?",
  ["1003012401_21"]="...",
  ["1003012401_22"]="No. For safety reasons, the Delphic Oracle mostly focuses on \"shaping\" rather than \"selecting.\"",
  ["1003012401_24"]="It had been some time since the girl became Aratos.",
  ["1003012401_25"]="Two years was not short, yet she still had not taught Phaenomena what currency is, what laws are.",
  ["1003012401_26"]="But she herself had changed so much.",
  ["1003012401_27"]="After becoming Aratos and coming to Phaenomena's side, she became more genuine, more daring.",
  ["1003012401_28"]="She learned to sing, grew to love stargazing, and even got to taste the legendary honey cake.",
  ["1003012401_29"]="This should have been something to be happy about, yet every time she put down the diaries of her predecessors and looked into the mirror, she would murmur.",
  ["1003012401_3"]="Her mother brought her favorite apple pie and taught her this.",
  ["1003012401_30"]="\"The one in the mirror... is that really still me?\"",
  ["1003012401_31"]="Her lyre had long gathered dust, its old melodies forgotten somewhere along the way.",
  ["1003012401_32"]="Letters to her family grew rare. The handwriting was familiar, but reading it felt clouded, as if through mist.",
  ["1003012401_33"]="Even her mother's apple pie tasted only of plaster-like sweetness. She no longer wanted a second bite.",
  ["1003012401_34"]="...",
  ["1003012401_35"]="\"Then why... why do I still shed tears after tasting it?\"",
  ["1003012401_38"]="Is this what they call \"shaping\"?",
  ["1003012401_39"]="Yes. Phaenomena is a star that will never fall, but Aratos grows up, ages, and dies.",
  ["1003012401_4"]="\"Fear not the storm, our little laurel. Your kindness and virtue will guide your path.\"",
  ["1003012401_40"]="Perhaps the first few Aratoses really did stay with Phaenomena simply as their hearts desired... but over time, this companionship changed into a method to soothe the anomaly.",
  ["1003012401_41"]="Since it became a means... all unstable factors needed to be removed to keep everything under control.",
  ["1003012401_43"]="...",
  ["1003012401_44"]="...They did not do this out of malice.",
  ["1003012401_45"]="In truth, it was only when an Aratos died unexpectedly—and her successor was lost and confused—that the Delphic Oracle realized the problem.",
  ["1003012401_46"]="From then on, they began to collect every detail about Aratos, building a thorough, meticulous template based on the first few generations.",
  ["1003012401_47"]="The first duty of every Aratos is to become Aratos herself.",
  ["1003012401_49"]="Every night, the girl dreamed.",
  ["1003012401_5"]="Her father crafted her favorite lyre and blessed her with these words.",
  ["1003012401_50"]="Sometimes of the earth, sometimes of the stars, sometimes of harvest, and sometimes of war.",
  ["1003012401_51"]="But no matter what the dream was, those scenes were too far from her—they were dreams that should not be hers.",
  ["1003012401_52"]="Those dreams belonged to a being named Aratos.",
  ["1003012401_53"]="By the time she realized this, everything……could no longer be stopped.",
  ["1003012401_55"]="The autumn festival arrived as scheduled. Her gentle father and kind mother saw their long-separated daughter again.",
  ["1003012401_56"]="The girl's singing was as graceful as the Muses—just like the Aratoses of yore: beautiful, wise, and pure.",
  ["1003012401_57"]="But only... she did not seem like their daughter.",
  ["1003012401_58"]="In that familiar body dwelled a stranger's soul.",
  ["1003012401_59"]="\"Mother, Father... Please don't look at me like that. Please don't grieve for me.\"",
  ["1003012401_6"]="\"You need not chase the star, our little bird. Your strings and melodies will bring her to rest with you.\"",
  ["1003012401_60"]="\"Of course, I am your daughter. Your little laurel, your little bird.\"",
  ["1003012401_61"]="\"But I will always be Aratos, and forever... her companion star.\"",
  ["1003012401_63"]="—And that is the story of the ■■th Aratos.",
  ["1003012401_64"]="The doll in the girl's hands falls silent, but that trace of red from the tale lingers on.",
  ["1003012401_65"]="They are bound together, like a knotted cord, entwining that deep blue star.",
  ["1003012401_66"]="...Until the dimness from the labyrinth arrives as well.",
  ["1003012401_7"]="Yet the girl still felt uneasy. She stepped into the hall and asked the sage who had long been waiting.",
  ["1003012401_8"]="\"Grand Oracle, may I ask you something?\"",
  ["1003012401_9"]="\"People say that Aratos is born with red hair and a voice as graceful as the Muses of myth—the embodiment of beauty, wisdom, and purity...\"",
  ["1003012501_1"]="Ariadne, I don't understand.",
  ["1003012501_11"]="Villains.",
  ["1003012501_12"]="Group of extremist.",
  ["1003012501_13"]="The flip side of C.A.V.E.",
  ["1003012501_14"]="Sixty points. The definition is concise, but you've overlooked some important aspects.",
  ["1003012501_15"]="Fifty points... Some within C.A.V.E. are no less radical than Nemesis members are when it comes to anomalies.",
  ["1003012501_16"]="Eighty points. Indeed, Nemesis and C.A.V.E. do share many similarities. It's just that when it comes to \"handling anomalies,\" the two sides have irreconcilable differences.",
  ["1003012501_18"]="...When did we switch to a 100-point grading system?",
  ["1003012501_19"]="Heh, don't overthink what the doll said.",
  ["1003012501_2"]="This incident only involves the Astronomical Academy, does it not? Is an anomaly accident of this scale worth your concern?",
  ["1003012501_20"]="There's no standard answer to this question. Everyone has their own answer.",
  ["1003012501_22"]="Then what about yours?",
  ["1003012501_23"]="I see Nemesis... as a signal.",
  ["1003012501_24"]="Through long history, C.A.V.E. has been locked in an equally long struggle with Nemesis.",
  ["1003012501_25"]="Like rats, they move through the shadows of history—not because they enjoy it, but because most of the time they lacked the strength to win in open conflict.",
  ["1003012501_26"]="Because of that, whenever Nemesis chooses to surface and act more aggressively, it means...",
  ["1003012501_28"]="Times are changing.",
  ["1003012501_29"]="They have accumulated enough strength.",
  ["1003012501_3"]="Because this incident is related to Nemesis.",
  ["1003012501_30"]="Eighty points. Throughout history, their appearance has always come with upheaval and chaos.",
  ["1003012501_31"]="Seventy points. Power waxes and wanes, but those in the shadows always hold the initiative.",
  ["1003012501_32"]="Exactly. That's why I see Nemesis's activity as a signal... a sign that order is loosening.",
  ["1003012501_33"]="The thirst for the unknown, the call of belief, the pursuit of wealth... For many reasons and lures, people grow weary of peace and start craving any form of change.",
  ["1003012501_34"]="And this desire has allowed Nemesis to accumulate more power, more leverage, enough to drive them to take extreme risks.",
  ["1003012501_36"]="Even if they send the Astronomical Academy into the sky...",
  ["1003012501_38"]="What do they gain from it?",
  ["1003012501_39"]="Then let me tell you a story. One about... the stars.",
  ["1003012501_40"]="That was an age when the gods had faded into legend, yet the Beacons still whispered, and anomalies were revered by the masses.",
  ["1003012501_41"]="In that wavering age, a star fell to Earth and landed in the Nereus Sea.",
  ["1003012501_42"]="Members of the Delphic Oracle sealed off the beach immediately but found no remains of the comet—only a bewildered human girl.",
  ["1003012501_43"]="From her origin to her nature, the Delphic Oracle debated fiercely. In the end, they agreed that this girl was the star herself. For some reason, she had taken the form of the first human she saw.",
  ["1003012501_44"]="So, to help her maintain a more human-like personality, the Delphic Oracle arranged for the girl who first discovered her to stay by her side, caring for her and providing guidance. They gave her a home, clothing, an identity, and a name...",
  ["1003012501_46"]="Phaenomena...",
  ["1003012501_47"]="Exactly.",
  ["1003012501_48"]="The reason why the countless generations of \"Aratos\" exist is actually the same—to use emotional bonds to help Phaenomena develop social traits like a human.",
  ["1003012501_49"]="At this point, Ariadne's expression turns serious.",
  ["1003012501_5"]="...I've heard of those names.",
  ["1003012501_50"]="But from another perspective, this is akin to domestication.",
  ["1003012501_51"]="Over this prolonged process, Phaenomena's nature as an anomaly would slowly be erased. For some... this is unacceptable.",
  ["1003012501_53"]="Nemesis.",
  ["1003012501_54"]="As sharp as ever, Head Librarian.",
  ["1003012501_55"]="The Apostle responsible for Delphi is called \"Erudito.\"",
  ["1003012501_56"]="The Military Academy once intercepted intel about Erudito. From what those fragments show...",
  ["1003012501_57"]="This Apostle holds anomaly knowledge known only to scholars and has an unusual obsession with anomalies, seeing the Delphic Oracle's interventions as blasphemy.",
  ["1003012501_58"]="Perhaps in Erudito's eyes, what we've done to Phaenomena is essentially reducing a magnificent celestial being to a human.",
  ["1003012501_6"]="I saw it... Fragments of your thoughts, your past experience intertwined with them.",
  ["1003012501_60"]="So, they want Phaenomena to return to her original form?",
  ["1003012501_61"]="That's likely Nemesis's true goal.",
  ["1003012501_62"]="They want to liberate this star—to strip away everything the Delphic Oracle has imposed on her.",
  ["1003012501_63"]="To let Phaenomena in her true form......return to the stars.",
  ["1003012501_7"]="This group called Nemesis has left indelible marks on your journey.",
  ["1003012501_8"]="It's a rare chance—let's talk about it, shall we?",
  ["1003012501_9"]="In your eyes, what kind of organization is Nemesis?",
  ["1003012601_1"]="Grand Oracle, all of this... it is your own doing!",
  ["1003012601_10"]="But compared to other C.A.V.E. members... you are indeed more open-minded.",
  ["1003012601_11"]="Open-minded?",
  ["1003012601_12"]="Our pursuits cycle through discovery, conquest, dominion, and suppression.",
  ["1003012601_13"]="Our endeavors bear little distinction from those of C.A.V.E.",
  ["1003012601_14"]="What the Head Librarian means is probably the difference in methods.",
  ["1003012601_15"]="Whether it's Eme-an or WeiShi, they try to separate anomalies from the mundane as much as possible—to protect the common people.",
  ["1003012601_16"]="Unlike the Academy Nation, where humans and anomalies can bond like Aratos and Phaenomena.",
  ["1003012601_17"]="This soil once tread by ancient deities.",
  ["1003012601_18"]="Though they have fallen, remnants of their influence still linger in these lands.",
  ["1003012601_2"]="You were overly lenient with the Astronomical Academy and Phaenomena. When you became aware of Aratos' grave illness, swift action was warranted!",
  ["1003012601_20"]="Ancient... deities?",
  ["1003012601_21"]="Well, that's a tale... from long ago.",
  ["1003012601_22"]="Before the concept of an Academy City even existed, many Beacons already stood here.",
  ["1003012601_23"]="Like deities, they shaped Delphi and coexisted peacefully with the humans living here. Witnessing these miracles, people revered them as the \"gods.\"",
  ["1003012601_24"]="But this state didn't last long. Eventually, for reasons still unclear, the Beacons of Delphi fell silent abruptly.",
  ["1003012601_25"]="People quickly realized... the gods were truly gone.",
  ["1003012601_27"]="...But their influence didn't simply vanish.",
  ["1003012601_28"]="Your perception is keen.",
  ["1003012601_29"]="Like a whale fall—where even in demise, a giant's remnants foster a distinctive ecosystem for decades.",
  ["1003012601_3"]="...",
  ["1003012601_30"]="The departure of these immensely powerful deities alone was sufficient to revolutionize human cognition and mold a fresh civilization.",
  ["1003012601_31"]="The history of coexisting with the deities is woven deeply into the essence of Delphians.",
  ["1003012601_32"]="When the deities departed, amidst brief turmoil and discord, the ancient Delphians turned towards the artifacts left behind—striving to unlock their enigmas and fathom the reasons for the deities' departure.",
  ["1003012601_33"]="This inclination reshaped human ideologies and ethics... and Delphi gradually transformed into an Academy City—a realm governed by scholars.",
  ["1003012601_35"]="Even so...",
  ["1003012601_37"]="Your methods of containing anomalies are still too rough.",
  ["1003012601_38"]="That crudeness comes more from necessity.",
  ["1003012601_39"]="Ariadne pauses slightly, gazing deeper into the labyrinth.",
  ["1003012601_4"]="Professor Aratos gave her life to the Academy Nation. I couldn't be so heartless as to take away an elder's final days.",
  ["1003012601_40"]="In fact, the Labyrinth of Reverie beneath our feet is one of the relics left behind by the gods.",
  ["1003012601_41"]="Think about it, Head Librarian. If you were a member of the Delphic Oracle, how would you truly \"isolate\" this labyrinth?",
  ["1003012601_43"]="...It can't be done.",
  ["1003012601_45"]="All you can do is monitor it closely.",
  ["1003012601_46"]="All you can do is find ways to minimize the harm it causes.",
  ["1003012601_47"]="Exactly. And this is what Aria and I have been doing all along.",
  ["1003012601_48"]="And anomalies like the Labyrinth of Reverie—which cannot be handled by conventional means—are not unique only in Delphi.",
  ["1003012601_49"]="In fact, the Delphic Oracle holds more anomalies and beacons than any other C.A.V.E. member. When other members fail to deal with certain anomalies, they sometimes entrust them to us for containment.",
  ["1003012601_5"]="Hmph, silver tongue! When you finally steel your resolve, you will just repeatedly proclaim, \"The Grand Oracle must prioritize the Academy Nation.\"",
  ["1003012601_50"]="So, rather than saying we are more \"open-minded\" in how we handle anomalies, it's more accurate to say... this is the only way for Delphians to coexist with these divine legacies.",
  ["1003012601_51"]="Hmph. It is this very complacency that has brought ruin upon the Astronomical Academy.",
  ["1003012601_52"]="Forget not—the tides of the Nereus Sea are already stirring, and echoes of other divine voices still resonate in the shadows of the Academy City.",
  ["1003012601_53"]="Grand Oracle, I fervently urge you to quell this academy... to set an example.",
  ["1003012601_54"]="...",
  ["1003012601_55"]="This city is not ruled by authority and violence, but by reason and truth.",
  ["1003012601_56"]="What's more... I don't think Delphi's enemies will be intimidated by such a threat.",
  ["1003012601_7"]="Ugh, why is she suddenly talking like she's in a book or something?",
  ["1003012601_8"]="This is the Labyrinth of Reverie. Many who lose themselves here were once kings and rulers.",
  ["1003012701_1"]="As I follow Ariadne's thoughts through the labyrinth, everything gradually becomes clearer.",
  ["1003012701_10"]="Since it became a means... all unstable factors needed to be removed to keep everything under control.",
  ["1003012701_100"]="...!",
  ["1003012701_101"]="All right, you've made your choice.",
  ["1003012701_102"]="Farewell, then...",
  ["1003012701_103"]="May this golden thread also illuminate your dreams in days to come.",
  ["1003012701_12"]="But in the end... why did it become such a heavy burden?",
  ["1003012701_15"]="...I don't understand.",
  ["1003012701_17"]="Why did it have to come to this?",
  ["1003012701_18"]="...",
  ["1003012701_19"]="Because that is the duty of C.A.V.E.",
  ["1003012701_2"]="A star fell on the Academy City. A young girl embraced its starlight, giving it the concept of \"humanity,\" becoming a bridge between the stars and the earth.",
  ["1003012701_20"]="To control anomalies and to protect the people. The Delphic Oracle simply chose the most stable, most efficient way to fulfill that duty.",
  ["1003012701_21"]="Though Phaenomena is an anomaly, she developed a basic sense of self-awareness after descending to Earth, forming a relatively stable behavioral pattern.",
  ["1003012701_22"]="To interact with her, the Delphic Oracle could only shape a \"human\" she would accept based on her habits.",
  ["1003012701_24"]="...Aratos.",
  ["1003012701_25"]="Exactly. The Grand Oracle at that time compiled all the records of the first generations of Aratos and established a system of succession.",
  ["1003012701_26"]="The Aratoses who came later could only continue this template to maintain the fragile balance, refining it in practice until it became a precise and complete behavioral code.",
  ["1003012701_27"]="Or, let me put it another way.",
  ["1003012701_28"]="Ariadne's expression turns serious.",
  ["1003012701_29"]="Think about it—without Aratos, how else could we coexist with Phaenomena... with a star like this?",
  ["1003012701_3"]="However...",
  ["1003012701_31"]="...",
  ["1003012701_32"]="For some reason, when talking about that journey, I suddenly recalled a past that I almost forgot.",
  ["1003012701_34"]="I'm simply tired of it all... Eme-an, C.A.V.E., and this never-ending library.",
  ["1003012701_37"]="But what if one day...",
  ["1003012701_39"]="What if one day, Aratos grows tired of this duty?",
  ["1003012701_40"]="What if one day, Phaenomena no longer needs this \"company\"?",
  ["1003012701_41"]="...",
  ["1003012701_42"]="In theory, that should never happen.",
  ["1003012701_43"]="The first criterion for selecting an Aratos is a longing for that star.",
  ["1003012701_44"]="After selection, the Delphic Oracle continues to \"shape\" the Aratos until she can truly fulfill her role.",
  ["1003012701_47"]="...",
  ["1003012701_48"]="An interesting scenario. But before that, we should discuss another question...",
  ["1003012701_49"]="Under what circumstances would that star, who does not yet understand the human heart, develop the will to refuse this companionship?",
  ["1003012701_5"]="Members of the Delphic Oracle sealed off the beach immediately but found no remains of the comet—only a bewildered human girl.",
  ["1003012701_50"]="She murmurs softly to herself.",
  ["1003012701_51"]="Hmm... no, maybe I've already grasped the key to this problem.",
  ["1003012701_52"]="Ariadne stops herself mid-thought. After a moment of hesitation, she swallows her words.",
  ["1003012701_53"]="In any case, for whatever reason...",
  ["1003012701_54"]="If that moment truly comes, then I have to activate the Labyrinth of Reverie.",
  ["1003012701_55"]="And I'll wear down this star with all the never-ending, limitless thoughts.",
  ["1003012701_57"]="But Aratos...",
  ["1003012701_58"]="But Phaenomena...",
  ["1003012701_59"]="Before I can speak, the stone floor beneath my feet suddenly trembles violently.",
  ["1003012701_6"]="From her origin to her nature, the Delphic Oracle debated fiercely. In the end, they agreed that this girl was the star herself. For some reason, she had taken the form of the first human she saw.",
  ["1003012701_60"]="The path twists beneath me, the depths ahead blur, and the labyrinth, like a waking beast, begins to stir.",
  ["1003012701_62"]="What's going on?",
  ["1003012701_63"]="The labyrinth must have truly noticed us.",
  ["1003012701_64"]="The tangled clues coil into threads, and broken thoughts disperse like mist. This moment of insight is as sweet as honey to it.",
  ["1003012701_65"]="Please hold tight to the golden thread in your hand. It will lead you out.",
  ["1003012701_67"]="And yours?",
  ["1003012701_68"]="Heh, don't worry about me.",
  ["1003012701_69"]="This kind of pondering is just an ordinary moment of quiet rest for me. I never truly stepped into this labyrinth; otherwise, we would have met in another form.",
  ["1003012701_7"]="So, to help her maintain a more human-like personality, the Delphic Oracle arranged for the girl who first discovered her to stay by her side, caring for her and providing guidance. They gave her a home, clothing, an identity, and a name...",
  ["1003012701_71"]="...",
  ["1003012701_72"]="Guest... hold the thread...",
  ["1003012701_73"]="The girl extends her hand gently.",
  ["1003012701_74"]="Though it is just an ordinary gesture, it carries a force impossible to refuse.",
  ["1003012701_76"]="(Reach out my hand.)",
  ["1003012701_77"]="In the next moment, the scenery around me bursts like a popped balloon.",
  ["1003012701_78"]="All knowledge gained, all answers found... vanish like a mirage before my eyes.",
  ["1003012701_79"]="The sense of loss from deep within makes my hands tremble uncontrollably.",
  ["1003012701_81"]="I've never felt the labyrinth so vast.",
  ["1003012701_82"]="The towering stone walls stretch infinitely through the void, each brick inscribed with blurred words.",
  ["1003012701_83"]="I recognize these words...",
  ["1003012701_84"]="They are all questions I have ever pondered, and all thoughts I have ever struggled with.",
  ["1003012701_85"]="What is the true nature of the Labyrinth of Reverie? What are the voices I heard? And that girl called Aria—what is she?",
  ["1003012701_86"]="The crumbling stones are them. The reflections on the lake are them. The drapery of the sky is them—even the echoing winds in the labyrinth carry the remnants of these questions.",
  ["1003012701_87"]="...",
  ["1003012701_88"]="This time, however...",
  ["1003012701_89"]="I...",
  ["1003012701_9"]="Perhaps the first few Aratoses really did stay with Phaenomena simply as their hearts desired... but over time, this companionship changed into a method to soothe the anomaly.",
  ["1003012701_90"]="No, I can't leave yet...",
  ["1003012701_92"]="...",
  ["1003012701_93"]="Just as my fingers begin to loosen, a warmth settles on the back of my hand.",
  ["1003012701_94"]="Don't lose yourself, or you'll be lost forever.",
  ["1003012701_95"]="You do not belong here.",
  ["1003012701_96"]="Beyond the labyrinth, there is someone... waiting for you. Try to remember what you knew before you lost your way here, remember where you truly belong.",
  ["1003012701_97"]="[Flashback: Zero's portrait.]",
  ["1003012801_1"]="...",
  ["1003012801_10"]="Beyond the labyrinth, there is someone... waiting for you.",
  ["1003012801_100"]="The Dean of the Military Academy casts a chilling glance over everyone.",
  ["1003012801_101"]="Erudito managed to stay hidden very well—not a single slip-up.",
  ["1003012801_102"]="In other words... everyone here, all our colleagues and students, are under suspicion.",
  ["1003012801_103"]="And that includes me as well. I suggest we all keep a close watch on each other during this discussion.",
  ["1003012801_104"]="Ariadne shakes her head.",
  ["1003012801_105"]="It's not just Erudito.",
  ["1003012801_106"]="Before the Tower of Babel collapsed, that massive metal sphere sleeping on the Philistine seabed...",
  ["1003012801_107"]="We went through considerable effort to assist Eme-an in recovering it.",
  ["1003012801_108"]="I had a hunch back then that things wouldn't end simply.",
  ["1003012801_109"]="As anticipated, the Tower of Babel collapsed, taking Eme-an down with it. If my hunch is right, more Nemesis members will soon turn their attention towards the Academy Nation.",
  ["1003012801_11"]="...",
  ["1003012801_110"]="...We must be fully prepared.",
  ["1003012801_111"]="Speaking of which, our team intercepted some data from a monitoring station near the Nereus Sea.",
  ["1003012801_112"]="A submarine belonging to Japheth, while on patrol near the Nereus Sea, suddenly went dark for unknown reasons and disappeared.",
  ["1003012801_113"]="You mean, Japheth has lost one of their submarines? That alone would put every intelligence agency and defense office on high alert.",
  ["1003012801_114"]="Relax. I'm not keen on seeing that kind of drama unfolding in our own backyard.",
  ["1003012801_115"]="I covered it up and sent out a fake signal suggesting it's still operational. The Japhethians will thank me later.",
  ["1003012801_116"]="However, before the submarine went dark, it managed to send a Morse code... Naturally, our monitoring station intercepted it too.",
  ["1003012801_117"]="What did the message say?",
  ["1003012801_118"]="The Dean of Mathematics Academy says nothing, but instead knocks a steady rhythm on the table.",
  ["1003012801_119"]="Besides Erudito... they found another name.",
  ["1003012801_12"]="Unfortunately, the storage room is still as quiet as ever, the locked door unbudged.",
  ["1003012801_120"]="...Drifter.",
  ["1003012801_121"]="Ariadne looks out the window, her gaze extending beyond the city.",
  ["1003012801_122"]="The weather is clear, the sky bright, and white doves glide over the fountain at Pallas Square, while the spires of the Academy City shimmer in the sunlight.",
  ["1003012801_123"]="However, what catches Ariadne's eye is not there. Her gaze drifts past the square, beyond the dome of Delphi, extending all the way to the distant Nereus Sea.",
  ["1003012801_124"]="It feels like there is something awakening unnoticed beneath that serene, mirror-like surface.",
  ["1003012801_125"]="A few days after the Astronomical Academy's crisis was resolved",
  ["1003012801_13"]="Only the starlight outside the window has dimmed.",
  ["1003012801_14"]="Obviously, no one had visited while I was asleep.",
  ["1003012801_15"]="So, it really was just a dream...?",
  ["1003012801_16"]="Click.",
  ["1003012801_17"]="As I attempt to figure out another way, a crisp sound comes from outside the window.",
  ["1003012801_18"]="I recognize it—the sound of climbing.",
  ["1003012801_19"]="Then a second, a third. The sound grows closer, stronger.",
  ["1003012801_2"]="It feels like an endless dream.",
  ["1003012801_20"]="Before I can react, a slender figure climbs over the windowsill and lands lightly on the carpet.",
  ["1003012801_21"]="...",
  ["1003012801_22"]="Sorry, I'm late.",
  ["1003012801_23"]="A few days after the Astronomical Academy's crisis was resolved.",
  ["1003012801_24"]="That's it.",
  ["1003012801_25"]="The academy has finally returned to the ground. We've managed to stop things from reaching the worst possible outcome.",
  ["1003012801_26"]="Now, it's time to wrap things up.",
  ["1003012801_27"]="Now, deans, let's summarize the situation.",
  ["1003012801_28"]="Fortunate for us, although this incident was earth-shaking, not a single person was lost in the chaos, and all the injured have been properly treated.",
  ["1003012801_29"]="The injured all underwent psychological suggestion and hypnotherapy—they'll believe they simply fell down a stairway in the Academy Nation. When they're discharged, we'll provide medical records matching their \"memories.\"",
  ["1003012801_3"]="Time stretches into countless blurred threads, continuous yet fragmented.",
  ["1003012801_30"]="Hmm... After the academy landed, I checked it several times with the team. Structurally, there's no critical damage.",
  ["1003012801_31"]="The Astronomical Academy can still be used as only a few areas need reinforcement. Master Hephae is already drafting a detailed plan!",
  ["1003012801_32"]="All personnel of the Nemesis involved in this incident have been detained by the Military Academy. We'll carry out even stricter investigations going forward.",
  ["1003012801_33"]="It's just a pity... our newly developed Mass Projection Attack System didn't get to be used in this operation.",
  ["1003012801_34"]="No need for pity! If we'd fired that thing, it would've been a total disaster!",
  ["1003012801_35"]="Hmph, a fuss over nothing. Even if it did fire, we'd have found a way to handle it.",
  ["1003012801_36"]="My hackers monitored the global information flow online and modified all related news reports. To the public, what happened in Delphi was just an ordinary minor earthquake.",
  ["1003012801_37"]="Great, you all have done a great job. So, let's wrap up...",
  ["1003012801_38"]="Wait, Grand Oracle! It's not over yet!",
  ["1003012801_39"]="All the deans turn their gaze towards her. The dean stands there, appearing on the verge of tears.",
  ["1003012801_4"]="When I wake up, the taste of that dream still lingers in my chest. I shake my head, trying to recall something.",
  ["1003012801_40"]="Grand Oracle, and everyone, I'm truly sorry to dampen the mood now.",
  ["1003012801_41"]="You all did an amazing work during the reconstruction. The Finance Academy has recorded all the relevant data, everything went smoothly, but...",
  ["1003012801_42"]="Did any of you even consider about the budget?!",
  ["1003012801_43"]="In just three days—three days! I've already received 1,700 patient bills from the Medical Academy, plus their insurance claims!",
  ["1003012801_44"]="And we consider the Mechanical Academy's excavation budget, the Military Academy's emergency mobilization stipend requests, and the Mathematics Academy's public opinion and traffic monitoring fees...",
  ["1003012801_45"]="The Dean of the Finance Academy takes a deep breath.",
  ["1003012801_46"]="I don't have the Midas touch, you know...",
  ["1003012801_47"]="Grand Oracle, do you even realize what our Academy Nation's debt ratio is right now?!",
  ["1003012801_48"]="Even if we operate day-to-day like any regular academy, legally we're a sovereign state. An academy might go bankrupt, but the Academy Nation can't!",
  ["1003012801_49"]="I regret to inform you, after what the Astronomical Academy pulled, our finances for this year are in serious trouble. Unless we find ways to increase revenue and cut costs, we might have to sell this land to Japheth or Cyril by this time next year!",
  ["1003012801_5"]="...The golden thread.",
  ["1003012801_50"]="Personally, I'd sell to Polestar—those guys practically swim in cash...",
  ["1003012801_51"]="All right, I understand your concerns completely. Thank you all—it's because of everyone working together that we managed to overcome this crisis.",
  ["1003012801_52"]="Yeah, yeah, and the one who caused this crisis still gets to leave her seat empty and dodge the blame she ought to bear.",
  ["1003012801_53"]="Ariadne gives a slight smile.",
  ["1003012801_54"]="I assure you, she's already facing far harsher consequences elsewhere than anything discussed in this meeting. Right now, she's surely reflecting deeply.",
  ["1003012801_55"]="She glances at Phaenomena's empty seat.",
  ["1003012801_56"]="Give her a little time. I'm sure when she returns, she'll be quite different.",
  ["1003012801_57"]="Now then, let's move on to more pressing matters... For example...",
  ["1003012801_58"]="After the meeting, she returns to her office and brews herself a cup of coffee.",
  ["1003012801_59"]="A knock sounds at the door.",
  ["1003012801_6"]="...The Labyrinth of Reverie.",
  ["1003012801_60"]="...Good timing.",
  ["1003012801_61"]="Come in.",
  ["1003012801_62"]="A girl politely pushes open the door, stepping in with a serious expression.",
  ["1003012801_63"]="Logos? If I remember right, the Philosophy Academy's internal meeting is tomorrow, isn't it?",
  ["1003012801_64"]="Or... is there an urgent matter?",
  ["1003012801_65"]="Yes... Dean Ariadne, it's about the Astronomical Academy.",
  ["1003012801_66"]="I've handed all reconstruction matters over to Daedalia. If it's about that, you'll need to visit the Mechanics Academy.",
  ["1003012801_67"]="And if it's about funding, I've already spoken with the Finance Academy. They'll handle it for you.",
  ["1003012801_68"]="No, it's something more sensitive.",
  ["1003012801_69"]="Ariadne sets down her coffee as if recalling something.",
  ["1003012801_7"]="But whether it was the person I spoke with or the words I exchanged—those memories keep slipping away like sand through my fingers.",
  ["1003012801_70"]="I see. It's about Dean Phaenomena, right?",
  ["1003012801_71"]="Yeah, ever since everything went down with the Astronomical Academy, Dean Phaenomena has been... well, I don't know if \"depressed\" or \"lost\" quite covers it. She heads to the observatory alone every night and just gazes at the stars.",
  ["1003012801_72"]="Of course, per your instructions, we only provided for her daily needs—we didn't interfere with her behavior.",
  ["1003012801_73"]="But today, Dean Phaenomena suddenly broke her routine and said... she's leaving Delphi.",
  ["1003012801_74"]="She was incredibly resolute. Not even Aratos could sway her...",
  ["1003012801_75"]="Did she mention where she's going?",
  ["1003012801_76"]="No. Professor Phaenomena only pointed in a direction and said she heard a melody there.",
  ["1003012801_77"]="Looking at the map, that would be around Japheth, near Bellefontaine. Surely... she doesn't mean to attend a concert there?",
  ["1003012801_78"]="Did she explain why?",
  ["1003012801_79"]="She said someone was calling her. The source of the voice is in Japheth.",
  ["1003012801_8"]="Only a few faint phrases remain.",
  ["1003012801_80"]="...",
  ["1003012801_81"]="Ah, that makes sense now... I see. That individual is in Japheth right now.",
  ["1003012801_82"]="After a brief moment of thought, Ariadne's gaze settles on the head student before her.",
  ["1003012801_83"]="Logos, it's time to start packing.",
  ["1003012801_84"]="You'll accompany Phaenomena on this journey.",
  ["1003012801_85"]="Me?!",
  ["1003012801_86"]="B-but isn't that Aratos's job?",
  ["1003012801_87"]="The Astronomical Academy still has some loose ends that she needs to tie up. Besides, she's still recovering and not up for long travels at the moment.",
  ["1003012801_88"]="And, more importantly... Phaenomena might prefer someone else by her side right now.",
  ["1003012801_89"]="Don't worry. I'll have a word with the Florentine family, and they'll sort out your travel arrangements.",
  ["1003012801_9"]="You do not belong here.",
  ["1003012801_90"]="Although, as tradition dictates, I should be the one to visit that new leader in person... but something more pressing has come up.",
  ["1003012801_91"]="You mean Nemesis?",
  ["1003012801_92"]="Scholars from the Military Academy mentioned that this Astronomical Academy incident seems connected to an Apostle named \"Erudito.\"",
  ["1003012801_93"]="Hearing this, Ariadne puts away her casual smile.",
  ["1003012801_94"]="Yes, and it's not just that.",
  ["1003012801_95"]="Besides Erudito... they found another name.",
  ["1003012801_96"]="Now then, let's move on to more pressing matters... For example...",
  ["1003012801_97"]="So, are we finally getting to the heart of the matter?",
  ["1003012801_98"]="After what happened, you must have noticed it, Grand Oracle. Nemesis has clearly dug its claws deep into the Academy Nation.",
  ["1003012801_99"]="Our intel shows that right under our noses, here in the City of Scholars, there's a Nemesis Apostle named \"Erudito.\"",
  ["1004041201_1"]="In World Calendar 57 A.D., you triggered a catastrophe in the Tower of Babel and closed the Library of Babel.&And you were killed in the disaster.&That's how your story comes to an end.",
  ["1004041201_10"]="Glancing sideways, she sees shelves floating mid-air, defying physical laws.",
  ["1004041201_11"]="How could a randomly chosen book from the Unknown Sector contain such surreal content?",
  ["1004041201_12"]="Once again, she focuses on the book in her hands.",
  ["1004041201_13"]="You realize this book predicts your every move, a notion that feels profoundly absurd. Yet, driven by curiosity, you decide to delve deeper.&It is December 23rd in World Calendar 53 A.D, and the Library has unexpectedly opened for an hour.&You are puzzled by why the Library of Babel suddenly activated the moment you returned to the Tower of Babel.&You are unsure what beckoned you into its depths.&Furthermore, you are clueless why such a randomly picked book details everything in a way that feels both absurd and strangely logical?",
  ["1004041201_14"]="Nonetheless, you follow its lead, despite your doubts.&Long ago, your fascination with the Path of No Return faded, as dedicating your life to a quest for an elusive truth seemed irrational.&While you once harbored faith in the miraculous hexagon, it waned long ago when your grandfather returned with that girl. You see yourself as a pragmatist, not an idealist.&Even though you are not fully convinced by the words in front of your eyes, your mind already races as you contemplate the purpose driving you towards that tragic end.",
  ["1004041201_15"]="Is it your hatred against this place that drives you?&No. There was a moment when you felt some resentment after your grandfather brought back the girl, and you let out your frustration to those around you.&But that passing feeling of annoyance didn't really represent who you are. Most of the time, you found enjoyment in making others feel awkward, which is why you took on that role.&So, you know deep down that you wouldn't destroy everything here over such a minor matter.&You're convinced that all these words are just a prank pulled by someone.",
  ["1004041201_16"]="Well, there's no harm in revealing the final answer early.&To rescue everyone, you will destroy the Tower of Babel, Ereshan.&You must destroy the Tower of Babel and deactivate the Library.&You're the only one capable of accomplishing this and rescuing everyone. That's why you're here, holding this book.&When you were just a little girl, your grandfather shared a story with you.",
  ["1004041201_17"]="Imagine an infinite number of monkeys typing away, and eventually, one of them will type out everything that happened in your life. The question is, how do you find that specific monkey?&Now, you have found that specific monkey. Or rather, that specific monkey has found you.&I am your destiny, your Tome of Fate... I am you. I am <b><color=#ff0000>Ereshan</color></b>.",
  ["1004041201_18"]="*Snap*",
  ["1004041201_19"]="Ereshan decisively shuts the book without hesitation.",
  ["1004041201_2"]="Ereshan raises an eyebrow as she reads those lines.",
  ["1004041201_20"]="What the heck?!",
  ["1004041201_21"]="Though she initially considers returning the book to the shelf, she refrains.",
  ["1004041201_22"]="Eventually, she stashes the book in her fanny pack.",
  ["1004041201_23"]="First things first, I've got to figure out how to run away from this hellhole.",
  ["1004041201_24"]="I don't want to end up getting lost in the Library.",
  ["1004041201_25"]="Restless after finishing the previous page, you slam the book shut in frustration, finding clumsy excuses to delay the next page.&A sense of fear, long dormant within you, has been reignited. You believe what you saw was a naive attempt to confuse you.&But that doesn't matter, because in the near future, you will open this book again.&You will witness how you struggle repeatedly, trying various paths in futile attempts.&Despite the multitude of paths attempted, only one ultimate route awaits the light, the fastest one. <b><color=#ff0000>Because that's the only path that light can select.</color></b>",
  ["1004041201_3"]="Standing before a series of bookshelves, she clutches a book in hand.",
  ["1004041201_4"]="These particular sentences feel like stones dropped into a calm pond, stirring up ripples in her long-stagnant heart.",
  ["1004041201_5"]="With a casual gesture, she flips the pages forward.",
  ["1004041201_6"]="It has become a habit for you to skip to the end of a book, finding comfort in knowing how things conclude in advance.&But this time, the words you read fail to offer that usual sense of reassurance.&A mix of unease and curiosity compels you to flip back to a random page, where new lines await your eyes.",
  ["1004041201_7"]="Ereshan's casual smile fades.",
  ["1004041201_8"]="Oh? Now that's intriguing.",
  ["1004041201_9"]="In a bizarre turn, the contents of this book seem to mirror her own reality.",
  ["10050602_1"]="Cool hues fading, distant rivers, mountains blend. Reeds cluster, mooring a boat, a solace to lend.",
  ["10050602_10"]="So, after a millennium, you're the first old friend to welcome me back, right?",
  ["10050602_11"]="The indistinct figure inclines its neck, as if in agreement.",
  ["10050602_12"]="A brisk breeze ruffles Ji Xia's composure. When he reopens his eyes, the crane is nowhere to be found, leaving only the rustling grass.",
  ["10050602_13"]="Then, the familiar sound of footsteps carried by the wind reaches his ears, prompting a sigh.",
  ["10050602_14"]="Well...",
  ["10050602_15"]="Quite the endurance to have made it this far, young lady.",
  ["10050602_16"]="Same here from my side.",
  ["10050602_17"]="Not far behind him, a young lady holding a fan emerges.",
  ["10050602_18"]="It's surprising to see someone of your stature resorting to rowing a boat to cover your tracks over such a long distance...",
  ["10050602_19"]="How would you like me to address you?",
  ["10050602_2"]="The majestic river flows quietly near the ancient bronze city, a boat peacefully anchored amidst lush reeds on the shore.",
  ["10050602_20"]="Sower? Ji Xia? Or perhaps... the First Emperor?",
  ["10050602_21"]="Despite Master Yuanquan's advice to show respect, your actions make it hard for me to do so.",
  ["10050602_22"]="Hah, I see. It's not exactly honorable to take a fisherman's boat, but I've left enough compensation for two new ones.",
  ["10050602_23"]="Zhantan narrows her eyes.",
  ["10050602_24"]="Are you trying to play dumb?",
  ["10050602_25"]="Ji Xia mirrors her action, narrowing his eyes, too.",
  ["10050602_26"]="Same here from my side.",
  ["10050602_27"]="Do you really have time to deal with me now?",
  ["10050602_28"]="Or even if I play along and don't run away, can you actually take me down within the time limit?",
  ["10050602_29"]="You may seem composed , but deep down, anxiety is gnawing at you, right?",
  ["10050602_3"]="Ji Xia places the pole in his hand down, stepping onto the damp soil on the bank.",
  ["10050602_30"]="You're not the only one who followed me all the way to QingYu City.",
  ["10050602_31"]="Now, WeiShi is not extending hospitality to guests from afar. That goes against Yuanquan's teachings, right?",
  ["10050602_32"]="Zhantan remains silent, but her gaze shifts towards the distant northern sky.",
  ["10050602_33"]="You've noticed them too, right? Our northern friends seem interested in Cerulean Water as well.",
  ["10050602_34"]="Well, I'm not bothered. Even if you're looking to fight here, I'm fine with it.",
  ["10050602_35"]="I've got plenty of time. But if you do fight me here, I wonder if you can keep up with our northern friends.",
  ["10050602_36"]="Zhantan's expression twists in frustration as she glares fiercely at Ji Xia.",
  ["10050602_37"]="I have a suggestion.",
  ["10050602_38"]="Since Yuanquan is here, why not leave me to him and go after our northern guests?",
  ["10050602_39"]="Or... do you doubt if Yuanquan can handle me?",
  ["10050602_4"]="Something appears to be drifting with the wind.",
  ["10050602_40"]="With a decisive snap, the lady puts away her folding fan.",
  ["10050602_41"]="Yuanquan has everything under control! You're just a cornered rat!",
  ["10050602_42"]="Without any hesitation, the young lady swiftly heads north, vanishing like a shadow over the river.",
  ["10050602_43"]="...A cornered rat, huh? Well, QingYu City is definitely cornered.",
  ["10050602_44"]="And there are way too many rats that have been around for too long.",
  ["10050602_45"]="Rain begins to fall on the river under the overcast sky.",
  ["10050602_46"]="Without delay, Ji Xia strides towards his destination.",
  ["10050602_5"]="Ji Xia looks down to see a remarkably large feather gently descending onto the river's surface before vanishing into the waves.",
  ["10050602_6"]="Everything seems normal, and Ji Xia does not immediately realize the feather should not have sunk. By the time he does, it is gone.",
  ["10050602_7"]="Looking into the wind, he spots a massive avian figure among the tall grass, somewhat resembling a crane.",
  ["10050602_8"]="The crane, symbolizing a spiritual essence, flaunts a millennium-long existence.",
  ["10050602_9"]="Ji Xia reflects for a moment before a realization dawns on him.",
  ["10050603_1"]="Alright, I need an update on what's happening now.",
  ["10050603_10"]="And I don't think we should try it. I trust the Head Librarian, who has been through so much with us, wouldn't put the people of CangLin City in harm's way.",
  ["10050603_11"]="Maybe this is the best course for now. With the root cause of Cerulean Blight unsolved, it might be wise to temporarily halt the contamination...",
  ["10050603_12"]="The young lady, with emerald eyes, gazes westward, adjusting her glasses.",
  ["10050603_13"]="Head Librarian.",
  ["10050603_14"]="And Master Yuanquan.",
  ["10050603_15"]="Please, we're all relying on you.",
  ["10050603_2"]="All the indicators are the same as usual.",
  ["10050603_3"]="Still the same, right...?",
  ["10050603_4"]="Yes, this has been the case since the Head Librarian left the city.",
  ["10050603_5"]="We've tried using cutting-edge devices, but no matter how we measure time and space—whether through the scientific lens or the C.A.V.E.'s secret knowledge system—the results don't change.",
  ["10050603_6"]="Time flow in CangLin City is stopped now. It's almost like this city is \"isolated\" from the natural flow of time, become an island detached from the outside world.",
  ["10050603_7"]="This is just like...",
  ["10050603_8"]="The Library of Babel.",
  ["10050603_9"]="We don't know how to fix this now.",
  ["10050801_1"]="A beautifully decorated letter sat on the desk.",
  ["10050801_10"]="I turned the envelope over and took a closer look.",
  ["10050801_12"]="There's no recipient name on it.",
  ["10050801_13"]="Since Master Yuanquan asked me to bring this to you, I'm sure it's meant for you, Head Librarian.",
  ["10050801_14"]="Go ahead, you can open it.",
  ["10050801_15"]="I carefully unseal the envelope, only to discover something a little awkward.",
  ["10050801_16"]="What's wrong, Head Librarian?",
  ["10050801_18"]="I can't understand it.",
  ["10050801_19"]="...It's written in Ancient Japhethian",
  ["10050801_2"]="The envelope is made of exquisite, high-quality paper, exuding a clear sense of luxury. Its opening is sealed with an intricately designed wax stamp.",
  ["10050801_20"]="Zero glances over the letter, then begins translating.",
  ["10050801_21"]="Oh, Eme-ans of the future...",
  ["10050801_22"]="I only wish I had been born in your time.",
  ["10050801_23"]="But even so, through your incredible library, I've seen wonders beyond imagination.",
  ["10050801_24"]="Today, I serve as the right hand of Emperor Rubicon, as he leads Japheth through a time of profound transformation.",
  ["10050801_25"]="I have no doubt that one day, you'll read about our legacy in the most glorious pages of history.",
  ["10050801_26"]="And if my descendants truly carry my will through the generations, then one day, a Florentine is sure to cross your path.",
  ["10050801_27"]="I'm writing this more than a thousand years before your time, entrusting it to a distant descendant who will one day deliver it to you.",
  ["10050801_28"]="The handwriting is surprisingly elegant for a general.",
  ["10050801_29"]="Yet in the bold, spirited words of each line, I can feel the energy of a man brimming with ambition, ready to charge toward his next victory.",
  ["10050801_3"]="The crest of the Florentine family... That seal was made with Florence's ring.",
  ["10050801_30"]="I folded the letter and tucked it away.",
  ["10050801_31"]="It feels like just a simple greeting, except the person sending it lived over a thousand years ago.",
  ["10050801_32"]="But why would the Florentine family go to all that trouble to send it now, and to you specifically?",
  ["10050801_34"]="Were there any other letters?",
  ["10050801_35"]="No, Master Yuanquan only gave me this one, then left for Fengbei.",
  ["10050801_37"]="Well...",
  ["10050801_38"]="Are you saying.... the Florentine family sent a letter written by Sarvis Florentine that is over a thousand years ago?",
  ["10050801_39"]="And without additional remarks?",
  ["10050801_4"]="I remember reading about it in Japheth's ceremonial archives.",
  ["10050801_40"]="No, Master Yuanquan only gave me this letter. Nothing else.",
  ["10050801_41"]="That is... strange. Isn't the Florentine family in the middle of a major crisis right now?",
  ["10050801_43"]="Crisis?",
  ["10050801_44"]="So they're in trouble too?",
  ["10050801_45"]="Yes, a massive one. And it's about to sweep across all of Japheth.",
  ["10050801_46"]="Calling it \"trouble\" would be putting it lightly.",
  ["10050801_47"]="Coincidentally... Just before you arrived at the Tower of Babel, the former Duke of Bellefontaine, Cosimo Florentine, suddenly passed away. His young daughter, Florence Florentine, inherited the title. Ever since, the Florentine family has ceased all contact with the other secret alliances, creating an intelligence vacuum in Japheth for C.A.V.E.",
  ["10050801_49"]="Is this also the work of Nemesis?",
  ["10050801_5"]="Every Duke and Duchess in the Florentine line has a signet ring that proves their title and power. Never to part with it in life, and to be buried with them in death.",
  ["10050801_50"]="Qing gives a wry smile.",
  ["10050801_51"]="I really hope not.",
  ["10050801_52"]="Because on the exact same day, at the exact same place, someone else has passed as well—the former Holy Cardinal of the Holy Cardinal Nation of Japheth.",
  ["10050801_53"]="Both of them died suddenly, and the authorities in Javriel quickly locked down the scene to keep outside speculation at a minimum. From what we know, the Cardinal Court is conducting a quiet investigation, but rumors are already spreading like wildfire. The political situation in Japheth has fallen into turmoil, and the Florentine family, caught in the eye of the storm, is too overwhelmed to handle anything else.",
  ["10050801_54"]="If Nemesis is behind this, then their reach is even more terrifying than we thought.",
  ["10050801_55"]="But here's what doesn't add up. Why would Duchess Florence send you that letter now, of all times? What's she really after? I just can't believe this is only about honoring some thousand-year-old wish from one of her ancestors.",
  ["10050801_56"]="Think about it... the letter was addressed to WeiShi, but its content was clearly meant for you. It's almost like they knew you'd be there when it arrived.",
  ["10050801_57"]="There's a saying in Qian: True meaning isn't in the words, but the implication between the lines.",
  ["10050801_58"]="But even then… I still can't figure this one out.",
  ["10050801_6"]="So if the ring was used to seal a letter, it must have been written personally by Duchess Florence.",
  ["10050801_60"]="If only we could ask the sender directly...",
  ["10050801_61"]="Hmm? That's actually not a bad idea.",
  ["10050801_62"]="WeiShi can't step in on matters outside of Qian because of our position and stance. But the Florentine family is one of the strongest secret alliances. If we can bring them back under the C.A.V.E. banner, it would be a huge difference. And honestly, as both the Head Librarian and the chairman of C.A.V.E., you're the best person to reach out to Duchess Florence directly.",
  ["10050801_64"]="But how am I supposed to meet her?",
  ["10050801_65"]="Yeah, that's the tricky part. Back then, we'd just send word, and they'd set up a meeting.",
  ["10050801_66"]="But Duchess Florence hasn't been seeing anyone from the secret alliances. She keeps to herself, and even the heads of businesses owned by the Florentine family hardly ever get a chance to meet her.",
  ["10050801_67"]="Wait... That reminds me.",
  ["10050801_68"]="The Buonarroti Museum in Bellefontaine is a sanctuary of art. Every year, as part of tradition, they host a three-day charity auction that attracts high-profile guests from all walks of life.",
  ["10050801_69"]="And the auction for this year is just around the corner.",
  ["10050801_7"]="But... this doesn't seem like it was written by the current Duchess.",
  ["10050801_70"]="If the Duchess still honors tradition like her forefathers did, she'll probably be there on the final night to host the banquet herself.",
  ["10050801_71"]="That would be the perfect chance for you to meet her.",
  ["10050801_72"]="WeiShi will arrange for you with a respectable identity, Head Librarian, and make sure you get an invitation to the event.",
  ["10050801_8"]="Zero points to a tiny line of script below the wax.",
  ["10050801_9"]="...Sarvis Florentine?",
  ["10050802_1"]="Several days had passed.",
  ["10050802_10"]="Still doesn't mean she can just hole up in her fancy \"little castle\" and pretend the outside world doesn't exist. Bellefontaine's already been patient with her, but Javriel sure won't be.",
  ["10050802_11"]="Are you seriously saying that she's going to miss the Holy Cardinal election, even though she's the Cardinal of Bellefontaine?",
  ["10050802_12"]="When is she finally going to make a public statement about all the recent controversies everyone's been talking about?",
  ["10050802_13"]="If you ask me, the late duke spoiled her way too much. All that pampering isn't doing her any favors. I mean, raising someone that delicate... how is she supposed to run an entire city?",
  ["10050802_14"]="So, who do you think is going to be the next Holy Cardinal?",
  ["10050802_15"]="I'd say maybe Lord Sistine.",
  ["10050802_16"]="You mean the great scientist who spent his life trying to prove the existence higher than humanity? Yeah... he's definitely got the stature for it. No doubt he could lead Japheth.",
  ["10050802_17"]="But the mystery around the last Holy Cardinal's death still hasn't been cleared up, has it? What's Javriel even doing? We still haven't heard an official statement yet...",
  ["10050802_18"]="Exactly. And we still don't have any answers about Duke Cosimo's death either.",
  ["10050802_19"]="Rumors are flying everywhere. Everyone in Bellefontaine is on edge, and the new duchess still hasn't shown her face once to even try to calm things down.",
  ["10050802_2"]="Bellefontaine, the City of Blossoms.",
  ["10050802_20"]="Hey, did you hear? Our reclusive new duchess is finally stepping out!",
  ["10050802_21"]="When was it announced?",
  ["10050802_22"]="Yup, today! Didn't you see the Florentine Guard clearing the roads this morning?",
  ["10050802_23"]="Word is, she's headed to Javriel to attend the upcoming Holy Cardinal election.",
  ["10050802_24"]="That's wild! Cosimo never even let her appear on TV. So now we're actually gonna see her in person, huh?",
  ["10050802_25"]="Exactly! Let's hurry over to the duchess's manor and see if we get lucky!",
  ["10050802_26"]="...Looks like Florence Florentine actually making a public appearance today.",
  ["10050802_28"]="Let's follow the crowd and take a look.",
  ["10050802_29"]="Behind the wide square stands a grand manor, beautiful and classically designed.",
  ["10050802_3"]="They call it the most beautiful garden in all of Japheth, and it truly lives up to the name.",
  ["10050802_30"]="This is the heart of Bellefontaine, the Florentine residence.",
  ["10050802_31"]="The square in front of the Florentine manor is packed shoulder to shoulder. Uniformed Florentine Guards push through the throng, trying to keep some semblance of order.",
  ["10050802_32"]="The noise was incessant, and people craned their necks, straining to catch a glimpse of the new Duchess, Florence Florentine.",
  ["10050802_33"]="Suddenly, the gates of the manor slowly opened, and the crowds quieted down.",
  ["10050802_34"]="A girl holding an umbrella steps out first, and beside her, under the shade it casts, walks another girl, even more finely dressed.",
  ["10050802_35"]="Her face is half hidden in the umbrella's shadow. Peering through the gaps in the crowd, I can just barely make out her tightly pressed lips.",
  ["10050802_36"]="Whispers ripple through the square again, mixed with quiet gasps.",
  ["10050802_37"]="Is that our new Duchess?",
  ["10050802_38"]="She looks so young…",
  ["10050802_39"]="Oh, I remember Duke Cosimo brought her to our restaurant once, but he never let anyone take photos of her.",
  ["10050802_4"]="Looking down its wide streets, rows upon rows of elegant old buildings stretch out like still waves on a silent sea, all drawing the eye toward a towering, majestic dome in the distance.",
  ["10050802_40"]="The young Duchess Florence turned a deaf ear to the chatter around her.",
  ["10050802_41"]="She stood tall, her back perfectly straight, as if a single taut string were running through her from head to heel, holding her perfectly upright.",
  ["10050802_42"]="Your Grace, the carriage is ready.",
  ["10050802_43"]="Florence moves from one shadow to the next as she makes her way toward the carriage.",
  ["10050802_44"]="Just before she steps inside, she looked back, maybe on purpose, maybe not.",
  ["10050802_45"]="So was it a deliberate gaze, or just a passing glance?",
  ["10050802_46"]="Either way, for a split second, I could've sworn her purple eyes met mine.",
  ["10050802_47"]="But it was over so fast, I wasn't even sure it happened, and I didn't get a clear look at her face.",
  ["10050802_48"]="Before I knew it, the door had closed, and the carriage was already speeding down the road.",
  ["10050802_5"]="The city seems to bloom outward from that grand cathedral, with flowerbeds spilling out at every turn. Vibrant blossoms shimmer against pure white marble, and every bricks and stones whisper centuries of history. The beauty of it all is almost too much to take in.",
  ["10050802_6"]="The main street is bustling with people. In the brief lulls while waiting to cross, snippets of casual conversations would always drift into one's ears.",
  ["10050802_7"]="...The election of the Holy Cardinal is about to start.",
  ["10050802_8"]="Yeah. I wonder what the young duchess is planning.",
  ["10050802_9"]="She's probably still mourning her father. I mean, she's not even twenty, and now she suddenly has to take charge of all of Bellefontaine...",
  ["10050803_1"]="Florence Florentine has left Bellefontaine.",
  ["10050803_10"]="Yes.",
  ["10050803_11"]="Let's head to the Buonarroti Museum then.",
  ["10050803_2"]="I couldn't help but let out a long sigh.",
  ["10050803_3"]="After a long and arduous journey to Bellefontaine, I arrived only to find that the person I came to see had already left for Javriel.",
  ["10050803_4"]="Security's going to be a lot tighter in Javriel with the Holy Cardinal election coming up.",
  ["10050803_5"]="Even if we followed her there, I doubt we'd get the chance to meet her in person.",
  ["10050803_6"]="I pause to think for a moment.",
  ["10050803_8"]="We've still got that invite to the Buonarroti Museum.",
  ["10050803_9"]="Maybe we should take some time to explore the city first.",
  ["10060101_1"]="The barbecue stall by the Nereus Sea... Only the teachers and students of the Academy Nation can apply for the operating rights. How did you qualify to set up a stall, Head Librarian of Eme-an?",
  ["10060101_10"]="That joke was scary!",
  ["10060101_11"]="Someone already submitted an application for you. Now, we just need to go through the final food safety review process.",
  ["10060101_12"]="To complete the review, I'll have one of each food category, please.",
  ["10060101_3"]="Huh? I've never heard of such a thing!",
  ["10060101_4"]="Well, then it seems like you're running an unlicensed operation. I'll deduct some points from your academy.",
  ["10060101_6"]="Oh, come on...!",
  ["10060101_7"]="Wait, I don't even belong to any academy!",
  ["10060101_8"]="That was just a joke.",
  ["10060102_1"]="Reserving a spot",
  ["10060103_1"]="Give me a honey cake.",
  ["10060103_10"]="...",
  ["10060103_11"]="I am the Dean of the Astronomical Academy.",
  ["10060103_13"]="Nope, not even if you were the Grand Oracle.",
  ["10060103_14"]="Ariadne said if I drop that title, others will respect me a bit more...",
  ["10060103_16"]="Before that, show some respect for my barbecue stand, even if we don't have honey cakes.",
  ["10060103_17"]="So... what other sweet do you have, other than honey cake?",
  ["10060103_18"]="(Sweet drinks also count, I guess?)",
  ["10060103_3"]="We don't have honey cakes.",
  ["10060103_4"]="Then give me a honey cookie.",
  ["10060103_6"]="We don't have anything with honey in it.",
  ["10060103_7"]="Why is there nothing?",
  ["10060103_9"]="Because we don't serve any desserts here.",
  ["10060104_1"]="Chirp chirp!",
  ["10060104_10"]="Do you really eat everything?",
  ["10060104_11"]="Chirp! (Absolutely!)",
  ["10060104_12"]="[BBNAME], please take the fried chicken off the menu.",
  ["10060104_2"]="Ann!",
  ["10060104_3"]="Chirp, chirp! (No time for explanations! Just give me whatever you've got!)",
  ["10060104_5"]="You chubby chicken!",
  ["10060104_6"]="There is no \"whatever\" here.",
  ["10060104_7"]="Chirp, chirp! (I thought we already had a tacit understanding! Do I have to place the order myself?!)",
  ["10060104_8"]="Chirp, chirp! (I'm a cute, little bird! And I eat everything! Just hurry up and give me something!)",
  ["10060105_1"]="Who would've thought the Head Librarian of Eme-an would also be running a snack stand?",
  ["10060105_2"]="And the food looks appetizing too.",
  ["10060105_4"]="Care for a taste?",
  ["10060105_5"]="I appreciate the offer, but too many carbs in this summer heat will make me drowsy...",
  ["10060105_6"]="Do you have anything here that's refreshing or energizing?",
  ["10060105_7"]="(Seems like only coffee will satisfy Ariadne's needs.)",
  ["101101_1"]="Are you alright?",
  ["101101_10"]="Yeah, I'm good.",
  ["101101_11"]="Under her indifferent gaze, I am compelled to change my answer to a positive one.",
  ["101101_12"]="Good to know.",
  ["101101_13"]="So, what is this place?",
  ["101101_14"]="The Beacon has been activated again, and now we are in the Library of Babel.",
  ["101101_15"]="But do not worry, we are in the Primordial Sector, the border between the Library and reality.",
  ["101101_16"]="Once the Beacon is deactivated, we will return to reality, just like before.",
  ["101101_17"]="Primordial Sector?",
  ["101101_18"]="Yes, the Library is divided into the Primordial Sector and the Unknown Sector.",
  ["101101_19"]="The Primordial Sector corresponds to a specific area, known as the Prototype, within the Tower in reality. The Unknown Sector was created by the Library itself through the Method of exhaustion.",
  ["101101_2"]="Yeah, I'm good.",
  ["101101_20"]="If you are not in the Primordial Sector when the Beacon is deactivated, you will not be able to get back to the real world.",
  ["101101_21"]="So, Ereshan...",
  ["101101_22"]="She accidentally ended up in some other sector.",
  ["101101_23"]="A slight frown appears on her face.",
  ["101101_24"]="Don't get along with her, huh?",
  ["101101_25"]="Are you worried about her?",
  ["101101_26"]="...",
  ["101101_27"]="I do not understand why you are asking, but since you are Seer, I am obligated to answer all your questions.",
  ["101101_28"]="From where I stand, I do not hold any grudges against her, though I can not say whether she feels the same way.",
  ["101101_29"]="...",
  ["101101_3"]="Not really.",
  ["101101_30"]="Ereshan is no fool. She can take care of herself.",
  ["101101_31"]="...",
  ["101101_32"]="Her calm gaze stays fixed on me.",
  ["101101_33"]="Almost as if waiting for me to give her some kind of instruction.",
  ["101101_34"]="Maybe we can go search for her together?",
  ["101101_35"]="Let's just stay here and wait for her.",
  ["101101_36"]="I asked hesitantly.",
  ["101101_37"]="Understood.",
  ["101101_38"]="Please stay by my side. I will protect you.",
  ["101101_39"]="I replied hesitantly.",
  ["101101_4"]="I see.",
  ["101101_40"]="Hazards are common within the Anomaly.",
  ["101101_41"]="I am not sure I can protect you all on my own.",
  ["101101_42"]="While she makes it seem like I have a choice, there is only one option for me.",
  ["101101_43"]="Maybe we can go search for her together?",
  ["101101_44"]="Sure.",
  ["101101_45"]="Go scout the area ahead, Ann.",
  ["101101_46"]="The bird perched on her shoulder lets out a sharp chirp before spreading its wings and flying off.",
  ["101101_47"]="Is that your pet?",
  ["101101_48"]="What's that creature?",
  ["101101_49"]="Its name is Anzu, but it is better not to call it that unless urgent.",
  ["101101_5"]="Upon receiving my affirmative response, she immediately shifts her attention to her surroundings.",
  ["101101_50"]="All beings have names, and names hold power. Calling something by its true name reveals its true nature.",
  ["101101_51"]="Although her answer does not exactly address my question, I have somehow gotten used to her way of talking.",
  ["101101_52"]="Alright.",
  ["101101_53"]="Let's call it \"Anchirp\" then.",
  ["101101_54"]="...",
  ["101101_6"]="Her question didn't carry any empathy or emotion, as if it were just a routine task.",
  ["101101_7"]="Really?",
  ["101101_8"]="...",
  ["101101_9"]="...",
  ["101102_1"]="Something seems off about that bookshelf over there.",
  ["101102_10"]="Her?",
  ["101102_11"]="Who are we not supposed to trust?",
  ["101102_12"]="I do not know.",
  ["101102_2"]="The way these books are arranged.... seems to be hinting at something.",
  ["101102_3"]="The arrangement...",
  ["101102_4"]="Is it some kind of binary code?",
  ["101102_5"]="Is it Morse code, perhaps?",
  ["101102_6"]="I do not think so. I can not decipher any valid information from it.",
  ["101102_7"]="Yeah.",
  ["101102_8"]="Do you know what it means?",
  ["101102_9"]="It means... \"Do not trust her.\"",
  ["101103_1"]="The bookshelves in this area are arranged differently.",
  ["101103_10"]="Because they discovered that if they offered their words and knowledge to the Library, it would generate new \"knowledge\" based on what they had given.",
  ["101103_11"]="By infinitely arranging and combining these words, all the history that has ever happened, the things that are happening now, and the prophecies that have yet to come, will be provided by the Library.",
  ["101103_12"]="Just like a conjunction in mathematics, this string of digits contains all possible combinations of numbers. Similarly, the Library contains all possible combinations of words.",
  ["101103_13"]="This Library serves as a repository for the entirety of humanity's known and unknown knowledge.",
  ["101103_14"]="It holds every question ever asked by humanity, with all possible answers to those questions.",
  ["101103_15"]="However...",
  ["101103_16"]="But it's all useless. The purpose of information lies in its retrieval, not creation. Simply compiling everything is the same as having nothing. If this information cannot be accessed, it is as good as nothing.",
  ["101103_17"]="Here, you will find everything but nothing you seek.",
  ["101103_18"]="You will be lost in an endless sea of information.",
  ["101103_19"]="If we go any deeper, we may end up on the Path of No Return.",
  ["101103_2"]="We have entered the Unknown Sector, a derivative sector created by the Library itself through the Method of exhaustion.",
  ["101103_20"]="We have to get back to the Primordial Sector.",
  ["101103_21"]="How do we get back?",
  ["101103_22"]="Look for <color=#FEC66B>bookshelves that are arranged in an orderly way.</color>.",
  ["101103_3"]="Exhaustion?",
  ["101103_4"]="She walks to a bookshelf, takes a book, and hands it to me.",
  ["101103_5"]="What is this thing?",
  ["101103_6"]="What's written in this book? What does it even mean?",
  ["101103_7"]="Nothing. What is written here does not make any sense.",
  ["101103_8"]="Do you know why the earliest humans built this tower?",
  ["101103_9"]="I shake my head.",
  ["101104_1"]="What does it mean this time?",
  ["101104_2"]="\"Irreversible.\" That is the direct translation.",
  ["101104_3"]="Irreversible? What is irreversible?",
  ["101105_1"]="This is the third time.",
  ["101105_2"]="...",
  ["101105_3"]="Let's go find Ereshan first.",
  ["101105_4"]="Let's go check it out.",
  ["101105_5"]="Understood.",
  ["101106_1"]="Well... \"Doom is fated.\" That is what it said.",
  ["101106_2"]="Someone is trying to warn us of something.",
  ["101106_3"]="...",
  ["101107_1"]="These traces are new...",
  ["101107_2"]="Causing widespread damage, behaving impulsively, and showing a blatant disregard for the consequences...quite the way for her to behave.",
  ["101107_3"]="If we continue to follow these traces, we will find her in no time, barring any unforeseen circumstances",
  ["101108_1"]="(The traces left by Ereshan seems to break off here. She should be just ahead, but the path is blocked by something heavy.)",
  ["101108_2"]="(We need to find another way to reach the area ahead.)",
  ["101109_1"]="It means... \"Do not trust her.\"",
  ["101109_2"]="Her?",
  ["101109_3"]="Who are we not supposed to trust?",
  ["101109_4"]="I do not know.",
  ["101110_1"]="\"Irreversible.\" That is the direct translation.",
  ["101110_2"]="Irreversible? What is irreversible?",
  ["101111_1"]="Looks like someone tried to send us a message through these bookshelves.",
  ["101111_2"]="Do you have any thoughts?",
  ["101111_3"]="Looks like some kind of warning.",
  ["101111_4"]="Whoever sent this didn't have enough time to explain the details.",
  ["101111_5"]="Who left these messages? And what were they trying to warn us about?",
  ["101111_6"]="You are right.",
  ["101111_7"]="We should let Ereshan know about this.",
  ["101111_8"]="She is more attuned to such things than I am. Perhaps she may have some insight.",
  ["101201_1"]="A kid?! What's a kid doing here in the Library?",
  ["101201_2"]="You are...",
  ["101201_3"]="The girl casts us a casual glance.",
  ["101201_4"]="So, you're the successors from the future.",
  ["101201_5"]="With just one glance, she sees through who we are.",
  ["101201_6"]="So, visitors from another sector... What are you seeking?",
  ["101202_1"]="It has been confirmed that the sector we were previously in was B80, and three years ago, the content of the books in this sector was changed to modern computer theory.",
  ["101202_10"]="There were no signs, no warning. For me, it ended in the blink of an eye.",
  ["101202_11"]="Me too.",
  ["101202_12"]="Hey, I'm talking to you. How did you manage to do that?",
  ["101202_13"]="I...",
  ["101202_14"]="I blink as my thoughts momentarily stop.",
  ["101202_15"]="I was just thinking about finding Tasny.",
  ["101202_16"]="...",
  ["101202_17"]="...",
  ["101202_18"]="Just like that?",
  ["101202_19"]="Yeah, as simple as that.",
  ["101202_2"]="Zero walks straight to a bookshelf, grabs a book, and starts flipping through it.",
  ["101202_20"]="What were you expecting?",
  ["101202_21"]="Were you expecting some kind of grand spectacle?",
  ["101202_22"]="Ereshan looks deflated.",
  ["101202_23"]="That doesn't make sense at all. Where did Cosmos find such a bizarre person?",
  ["101202_24"]="Her voice trails off, almost inaudible.",
  ["101202_25"]="I should just stop calling you the \"Seer\" and start calling you the \"Almighty time machine.\"",
  ["101202_26"]="So, our next move...",
  ["101202_27"]="Shall we go find Tasny?",
  ["101202_28"]="For some reason, there's gloom in Ereshan's voice.",
  ["101202_29"]="We've come this far already. Let's go find Tasny and the command to stop the sphere. We can't be too prepared anyway.",
  ["101202_3"]="For a hundred years before that, this sector was exclusively dedicated to astrophysics.",
  ["101202_30"]="I'm curious what other miracles I'll witness on this trip.",
  ["101202_4"]="Anchirp circles in the air and gracefully lands on its master's shoulder, chirping at Zero.",
  ["101202_5"]="Chirp... Chirp chirp...",
  ["101202_6"]="Zero listens attentively, then looks at Ereshan and me before announcing her conclusion.",
  ["101202_7"]="We have indeed traveled to the past.",
  ["101202_8"]="Ereshan's expression becomes unreadable.",
  ["101202_9"]="How did you perceive it?",
  ["101203_1"]="The Foolproof Door",
  ["101203_10"]="Don't even bother. This gate has 5,000 questions in total. Going through all of them will take you days even without any breaks.",
  ["101203_11"]="Let's just blast it away.",
  ["101203_12"]="No, it won't budge. It's stronger than you can ever imagine.",
  ["101203_13"]="Not even Mer can do anything about it.",
  ["101203_14"]="So, what should we do now?",
  ["101203_15"]="Enki left a back door so that someone could open it.",
  ["101203_16"]="Someone?",
  ["101203_17"]="The one who raised us.",
  ["101203_18"]="That's not important... Well, let's get back to the main hall, and I'll tell you what to do.",
  ["101203_2"]="The Foolproof Door?",
  ["101203_3"]="Yeah, the coded gate set up by my stupid brother. It'll open only when all its questions are answered.",
  ["101203_4"]="Ticktock... Here's your question:",
  ["101203_5"]="How many moons would fit inside one Kepler 452b?",
  ["101203_6"]="Huh? Who in the world knows the answer to such a question?!",
  ["101203_7"]="249",
  ["101203_8"]="Correct.",
  ["101203_9"]="Next question...",
  ["101204_1"]="See those messed-up books?",
  ["101204_2"]="Enki did that on purpose.",
  ["101204_3"]="Just put them back on the center shelf in a specific order, clockwise, and that gate will open.",
  ["101205_1"]="The Girl and the Colossus",
  ["101205_10"]="I just do.",
  ["101205_11"]="Everything in this Ordered World is crystal clear to me. I know all the answers to any question without any rhyme or reason.",
  ["101205_12"]="However...",
  ["101205_13"]="Ninsar's gaze lands on me, and she waves at me like I am some tiny critter.",
  ["101205_14"]="Come.",
  ["101205_15"]="Despite her childlike face and voice, her voice carries an irresistible force.",
  ["101205_16"]="I gather my courage and walk towards her.",
  ["101205_17"]="Seer, right? So, the future Cosmos did receive an interesting prophecy. I knew that a person who was so good at disguise wasn't as ordinary as he seemed.",
  ["101205_18"]="She raises her hand and tickles my face with her fingertips.",
  ["101205_19"]="I can't see through you, but since you're favored by the Library of Babel, I'm willing to help you find the answers you seek.",
  ["101205_2"]="I see. It seems you've undergone unbelievable adventures to finally get here.",
  ["101205_20"]="As a matter of fact, I'm searching for Tasny, too.",
  ["101205_21"]="Anticipating Ereshan's next question, Ninsar answers before she can even speak.",
  ["101205_22"]="Tasny is my bloodline.",
  ["101205_23"]="At that moment, Ninsar seems to think of something.",
  ["101205_24"]="Speaking of which, I do have a question that only you can answer.",
  ["101205_25"]="Have you seen a librarian named Enki on the list?",
  ["101205_26"]="Zero, who has been silent, shakes her head.",
  ["101205_27"]="No.",
  ["101205_28"]="And your name is not on them either.",
  ["101205_29"]="I see.",
  ["101205_3"]="Who are you?",
  ["101205_30"]="Ninsar lets out a soft sigh.",
  ["101205_31"]="Looks like neither Enki nor I have returned from the journey.",
  ["101205_32"]="Let's go. Time is ticking.",
  ["101205_4"]="My name is Ninsar.",
  ["101205_5"]="...",
  ["101205_6"]="Don't you have anything to ask us?",
  ["101205_7"]="No, I have nothing to ask you, bloodline of Cosmos.",
  ["101205_8"]="Did she just say \"bloodline\"?",
  ["101205_9"]="How do you know?",
  ["101206_1"]="Why is this area blocked off?",
  ["101206_2"]="This is The Foolproof Door.",
  ["101301_1"]="Three Years Later",
  ["101301_10"]="I'm getting more and more intrigued by you.",
  ["101301_11"]="Do you have the slightest idea who you're talking to?",
  ["101301_12"]="Ah, never mind.",
  ["101301_13"]="Report in, Zero.",
  ["101301_14"]="Working on it.",
  ["101301_15"]="Something seems to have appeared on the desk.",
  ["101301_2"]="20 years before the World Calendar",
  ["101301_3"]="Director's Office",
  ["101301_4"]="That's it?",
  ["101301_5"]="Yeah.",
  ["101301_6"]="I believe so.",
  ["101301_7"]="Feels like nothing really happened at all, like always. What did you do, exactly?",
  ["101301_8"]="I'm not sure, either.",
  ["101301_9"]="Are you expecting something special?",
  ["101302_1"]="We approach the desk.",
  ["101302_10"]="Anyway, there are five documents in total. If you guys don't have anything better to do, look out for them.",
  ["101302_11"]="Let's get back on track. I'm holed up in the conference room because of some emergencies.",
  ["101302_12"]="I've hidden the access to the conference room in the Hall of Keys. Grab that first and then come find me.",
  ["101302_13"]="I've left some markings on the path to the Hall of Keys, so keep your eyes peeled for them...",
  ["101302_14"]="What kind of markings, you ask? Well, the kind only a genius like me can create. Don't bother looking for me if you can't even recognize them...",
  ["101302_15"]="After all, communicating with a dimwit would just bring me down to their level!",
  ["101302_16"]="(Tear off the note.)",
  ["101302_17"]="A vibration comes from a short distance away.",
  ["101302_2"]="As expected, there is a piece of paper on it.",
  ["101302_3"]="Hey, fools! If you are actually reading this note, congrats! You've made it to the world three years later.",
  ["101302_4"]="Praise me, Master Enki, the Great God of Wisdom! I've sifted through all the documents I could find and translated everything about this copper ball into modern language.",
  ["101302_5"]="P.S. I was thinking of writing the conclusion in \"A Vulgar Language Even Fools Can Understand\" (crossed out)—in the \"Complete Language\", but Ninsar said you probably won't get it, so I gave up on the idea.",
  ["101302_6"]="Seems like the \"Complete Language\" is still too advanced for humans... Well, the stupidity of idiots never ceases to amaze me.",
  ["101302_7"]="I've stored most of the documents in the library, planning to show off to you... but then I realized it's not worth showing off at all.",
  ["101302_8"]="Displaying knowledge that even morons can comprehend is just plain boring!",
  ["101302_9"]="And who knows if you'll even find that sector after three years? So, I just tossed it somewhere along the way...",
  ["101303_1"]="This must be the library Master Enki mentioned in his note.",
  ["101303_2"]="We should keep an eye out for the documents that Master Enki mentioned.",
  ["101304_1"]="Speaking of that, why isn't that annoying brat waiting for us where we agreed?",
  ["101304_2"]="Is he trying to hide from something?",
  ["101_1"]="I'll Share This Amazing News with the Whole World",
  ["1020201_1"]="This is such a mess. It's like a battle just took place here.",
  ["1020201_2"]="Maybe that's exactly what happened.",
  ["1020201_3"]="According to historical records, this is the time when the war between Obed and Japheth erupted.",
  ["1020201_4"]="We might have arrived at a point where the war is still ongoing.",
  ["1020201_5"]="They can fight their wars all they want, but why did they break into the Library... and make such a mess? How annoying.",
  ["1020201_6"]="Let's go find Eme-ans from this era. They should be able to help us.",
  ["1020202_1"]="The shape of that building... it looks like a throne.",
  ["1020202_2"]="It used to be a throne indeed.",
  ["1020202_3"]="The history of the Library of Babel and Eme-an is far older than the fleeting thrones of this land.",
  ["1020202_4"]="Thrones may rise and fall, yet the Tower stands firm. True Eme-ans must adapt to the shifting of power and serve the reigning monarchs, but that does not mean we owe them our allegiance.",
  ["1020202_5"]="However, during the eras when the Tower of Babel wasn't forgotten, almost every monarch took pride in conquering it. The throne within the tower was a testament to their conquest.",
  ["1020202_6"]="With the Library's opening, the Primordial Sector housing the throne became a prominent landmark.",
  ["1020202_7"]="Anyway, since we don't have a specific goal, why don't we head in that direction? Perhaps we'll stumble upon unexpected treasures.",
  ["1020301_1"]="These are traces left by the marching soldiers.",
  ["1020301_2"]="It seems they're not far ahead. Let's hope we can still reason with those Japhethians in the Tower.",
  ["1020401_1"]="Are you... Eme-ans?",
  ["1020401_10"]="I apologize. Our general is nearby, but this place is dangerous. Please allow us to clear the path ahead for you.",
  ["1020401_2"]="Our general is looking for you...",
  ["1020401_3"]="Why bother being polite with these wicked sorcerers?! We wouldn't be trapped in this never-ending labyrinth if it weren't for them!",
  ["1020401_4"]="General ordered us to treat Eme-ans with proper etiquette...",
  ["1020401_5"]="Ereshan raises an eyebrow at the sight.",
  ["1020401_6"]="Well, let's skip the pleasantries. To be honest, we're looking for your commander, too.",
  ["1020401_7"]="And you should already know that none of you will make it in this maze without us",
  ["1020401_8"]="Are you threatening us?!",
  ["1020401_9"]="Silence!",
  ["1020402_1"]="Thank you for coming to our aid once again.",
  ["1020402_2"]="No need to thank us. You mentioned your general is close, so I wonder where we can find his royal highness?",
  ["1020402_3"]="You filthy scum! How dare you ask about His Majesty's whereabouts?!",
  ["1020402_4"]="His Majesty showed great sincerity by bringing only dozens of praetorians into this tower, as per your request.",
  ["1020402_5"]="But you set your vile trap and scattered us...",
  ["1020402_6"]="Oh, I get it. You guys got separated.",
  ["1020402_7"]="You...",
  ["1020402_8"]="Please, Ere, stop.",
  ["1020402_9"]="Our general is just up there, not too far away. Please head in that direction.",
  ["1020501_1"]="What are you waiting for, Master Director?",
  ["1020501_2"]="Do you seriously think we can defeat the mighty Japheth phalanx at the peak of their power?",
  ["1020501_3"]="Just activate your amazing time machine and make a quick escape!",
  ["1020501_4"]="Where to?",
  ["1020501_5"]="To the past? Or the future?",
  ["1020501_6"]="Anywhere will do! Just stop with the questions and do something!",
  ["1020501_7"]="Just go to the future, like a month later! Let's get away from them!",
  ["1020501_8"]="Let's start scanning!",
  ["1020701_1"]="Hmm? Who are those people?",
  ["1020701_2"]="Judging by their attire, they must be the Immortal Army, Darius' praetorians.",
  ["1020701_3"]="Of course I know that, but... why are there so many Immortal Army soldiers wandering inside the Library in this era?",
  ["1020702_1"]="Your Majesty... please forgive us. We are devoted to you...",
  ["1020702_2"]="Hey!",
  ["1020702_3"]="Tsk... they can't even hear us? Never mind, let's keep going. We'll surely find someone we can reason with, right?",
  ["1020901_1"]="The main path is blocked.",
  ["1020901_2"]="In moments like this, it's time to show some innovation.",
  ["1021001_1"]="Those who betrayed His Majesty... shall remain silent... forever.",
  ["1021001_10"]="I feel ashamed to admit that I've known for a while that my time would come soon.",
  ["1021001_11"]="But His Majesty once said he would share his dreams and glory with us. I want to return to His Majesty's throne before drawing my last breath.",
  ["1021001_12"]="Please, don't let my journey end here.",
  ["1021001_13"]="I can lend you a shoulder.",
  ["1021001_14"]="Thank you for your generosity. Although I can't see your face now, I'll always remember your kindness.",
  ["1021001_15"]="Well, I have nothing to say to a blind loyalist like him... Take good care of him.",
  ["1021001_2"]="Hey, are you alright? Tsk...",
  ["1021001_3"]="No, his mental state has irreversibly deteriorated.",
  ["1021001_4"]="...",
  ["1021001_5"]="Are you alright?",
  ["1021001_6"]="Ah... I... I apologize, esteemed Eme-ans... I wasn't myself.",
  ["1021001_7"]="Sit down and take a break. You don't have to put up a strong front here because there's no emperor who requires your worship.",
  ["1021001_8"]="I appreciate your kindness, but I don't deserve forgiveness.",
  ["1021001_9"]="I made a solemn vow to His Majesty that I would never stop my journey until his realm reached the ends of the world. Yet here I am, empty-handed, a disgrace to His Majesty's glory.",
  ["1021002_1"]="This place feels... familiar.",
  ["1021002_2"]="The device in the center should be able to take us down below.",
  ["1021002_3"]="The correct switch is hidden under the <color=#fec66b>tome that glorifies His Majesty</color>.",
  ["1021003_1"]="That shape... it's His Majesty's throne!",
  ["1021003_2"]="Thank you for bringing me here. His Majesty is just ahead.",
  ["1021201_1"]="I never expected someone to come to my rescue. Thank you so much.",
  ["1021201_10"]="I'm sorry, but when we entered this infinite library again, we got separated from our general... I have no clue where he could be now.",
  ["1021201_11"]="The path ahead takes us back to where we came from. Let's head in that direction.",
  ["1021201_12"]="Aren't you coming with us?",
  ["1021201_13"]="As you can see, my squad has been decimated...",
  ["1021201_14"]="With all the dangers lurking here, we shouldn't burden you with protecting us. Please hurry to the general as soon as possible.",
  ["1021201_15"]="...",
  ["1021201_16"]="Let's go.",
  ["1021201_2"]="Wait, you're... the Eme-ans who escaped from Lord Sarvis before!",
  ["1021201_3"]="So what if we are? Are you planning to capture us and hand us over to your general?",
  ["1021201_4"]="No, we Japhethians are anything but ungrateful.",
  ["1021201_5"]="Anyway, it's good to see you. We've been searching for you.",
  ["1021201_6"]="Sarvis just won't leave us alone, huh?",
  ["1021201_7"]="That's not the case, Eme-an.",
  ["1021201_8"]="Lord Sarvis has encountered an extraordinary problem, and he says only Eme-ans can solve it.",
  ["1021201_9"]="As I thought... Then what are we waiting for? Lead the way.",
  ["1021401_1"]="Geez! Not another one of those annoying stone gates!",
  ["1021401_2"]="Don't worry. My strength should be enough to break through it.",
  ["1021401_3"]="However, I've just exerted a lot of energy. Give me a moment to catch my breath.",
  ["1021401_4"]="Fine... Take a step back, [BBNAME].",
  ["1030201_1"]="This realm hasn't started collapsing yet. It seems Ereshan hasn't found Aten.",
  ["1030201_2"]="Nanna and Shamash took Aten to the top of the tower before the Beacon was activated. We need to find them before Ereshan does.",
  ["1030501_1"]="Hey, there you are, Zero!",
  ["1030501_10"]="So, what's your plan now?",
  ["1030501_11"]="There's no warmth in their exchange—only tension hanging in the air, on the brink of a clash.",
  ["1030501_12"]="When Zero opens her eyes again, her chilling gaze freezes everything.",
  ["1030501_13"]="I will stop you here. You can save your explanations for when I heal you.",
  ["1030501_14"]="So, no room for negotiation, I guess.",
  ["1030501_15"]="You never intended to negotiate from the start.",
  ["1030501_16"]="Zero raises her wand.",
  ["1030501_17"]="Step back.",
  ["1030501_18"]="She doesn't turn around, but I know she's addressing me with those words.",
  ["1030501_2"]="Out of nowhere, Ereshan appears in front of us, her lips curling into an elusive smile.",
  ["1030501_3"]="You're a bit too late, aren't you?",
  ["1030501_4"]="Where is Aten?",
  ["1030501_5"]="Why are you so sure that I've found it?",
  ["1030501_6"]="No reason.",
  ["1030501_7"]="You're being unreasonable. Don't I have a chance to explain myself?",
  ["1030501_8"]="No, you do not. You are just trying to buy more time, and listening to your explanation would only play into your hands.",
  ["1030501_9"]="Ha... you remember my teachings well.",
  ["1030601_1"]="Let's activate the central computer ahead.",
  ["1030602_1"]="Let's see... with the current computational power, it'll take us another 24 hours to go through every possible combination.",
  ["1030602_2"]="That's hardly surprising, to be honest. Looks like we'll have to connect the other arithmetic modules.",
  ["1030801_1"]="The walls and floor seems to ripple, and suddenly the room feels out of place.",
  ["1030801_2"]="Space.",
  ["1030801_3"]="The timeline of this Library is collapsing, along with the nearby time periods... I'm afraid Ereshan has caused it.",
  ["1030801_4"]="This space is highly unstable now, and we can't be sure which point in time we've been sent back to.",
  ["1030801_5"]="...",
  ["1030801_6"]="But don't worry. We still have a chance before the timeline of this space collapses completely.",
  ["1030801_7"]="How much more do we need?",
  ["1030801_8"]="Sixty percent.",
  ["1030801_9"]="We need to pick up the pace.",
  ["1030901_1"]="And this arithmetic module is connected, too.",
  ["1030901_2"]="Alright, we're down to the last module. Let's keep going.",
  ["1031001_1"]="The last module is now connected. We can leave now.",
  ["1031101_1"]="We've successfully restarted, and now... we'll leave everything else to the brute force method.",
  ["1031101_2"]="Don't let anything get near it until it finishes the calculation.",
  ["1031301_1"]="A strange sensation brushes against my skin.",
  ["1031301_10"]="For the Library itself, time and space are intertwined. It created these infinite rooms by organizing all possibilities in both time and space simultaneously.",
  ["1031301_11"]="So naturally, if the Library collapses, time collapses with it.",
  ["1031301_12"]="When time and space collapse together... it's like a black hole in reality.",
  ["1031301_13"]="Once you cross the event horizon, all measurements and laws will cease to exist.",
  ["1031301_14"]="Think of this Library as a colossal kaleidoscope.",
  ["1031301_15"]="As it destabilizes and starts spinning, countless fragments fall, crack, and collide, intersecting in space and intertwining in time.",
  ["1031301_16"]="What you saw is probably the time sector from when you first encountered Ereshan and Aten, merged with our current time.",
  ["1031301_17"]="Can we use this to change what happened in the past?",
  ["1031301_18"]="What resides within the light cone is destined.",
  ["1031301_19"]="The collapse starts here, at the singularity of the black hole. All light cones will curve toward the singularity, ultimately leading to an impenetrable event horizon.",
  ["1031301_2"]="The walls and floor seem to ripple.",
  ["1031301_20"]="Even if we can change the past, it is destined.",
  ["1031301_21"]="What else can we do?",
  ["1031301_22"]="Find Aten.",
  ["1031301_23"]="This isn't over yet. Aten hasn't detonated itself... because if it did, everything here would be eliminated. We still have a chance.",
  ["1031301_24"]="Where do you think it could be?",
  ["1031301_25"]="It must be at the starting point, where the Beacon is located.",
  ["1031301_26"]="No Anomalies can resist their instinct to get close to the Beacon.",
  ["1031301_3"]="Did you see that just now?",
  ["1031301_4"]="Yeah, I did.",
  ["1031301_5"]="Zero's words confirm that what I witnessed wasn't an illusion.",
  ["1031301_6"]="Evidently, the scene I just saw was the moment when Ereshan pushed me from the past into the abyss.",
  ["1031301_7"]="But when we arrive here, everything vanishes like a mirage.",
  ["1031301_8"]="What is going on here?",
  ["1031301_9"]="The Library is collapsing due to Aten's massive destruction.",
  ["1031302_1"]="The sounds of collapse echo from all directions, all distances.",
  ["1031302_10"]="Hmm? These bookshelves...",
  ["1031302_11"]="I see. Do you remember what it was like when we first got here?",
  ["1031302_12"]="That time sector is overlapping with the one we're in now.",
  ["1031302_13"]="While we can observe them, they can't do the same with us.",
  ["1031302_14"]="Can we influence their sector?",
  ["1031302_15"]="I'm not sure, but it's worth a shot.",
  ["1031302_16"]="Those books, arranged in Morse code.",
  ["1031302_17"]="Back then, the people who sent messages to us were no other than our present selves.",
  ["1031302_18"]="A spark lights up my eyes.",
  ["1031302_19"]="If you convey a more precise message to our past selves, reminding them that Ereshan is the betrayer and that everything is a loop, would our past selves evade such a future?",
  ["1031302_2"]="In dimensions beyond human perception, shards of time collide with those of space.",
  ["1031302_20"]="Let's give it a try.",
  ["1031302_3"]="Numerous waves of peculiar ripples sweep through the corridors, akin to the aftermath of invisible raindrops falling and stirring.",
  ["1031302_4"]="I halt in my tracks.",
  ["1031302_5"]="What's wrong?",
  ["1031302_6"]="This place feels familiar.",
  ["1031302_7"]="We've been here before.",
  ["1031302_8"]="These bookshelves...",
  ["1031302_9"]="Zero also realizes something.",
  ["1031303_1"]="Without wasting time, I start arranging the books based on my faint memories.",
  ["1031303_2"]="But halfway through, my heart sinks as I suddenly realize the flaw in my naive plan.",
  ["1031303_3"]="Every version of \"me\" who stood in front of this bookshelf had the same idea. We're all stuck in this tragic loop, just like Oedipus.",
  ["1031303_4"]="Noticing my disappointment, Zero takes the books from my hands and continues arranging them.",
  ["1031303_5"]="We won't make it.",
  ["1031303_6"]="I know, but even so, we should follow what has already happened.",
  ["1031303_7"]="Otherwise, the space would become even more unstable. Let's start from there. I remember the codes for those books.",
  ["1031303_8"]="With little hope left, I quickly rearrange the books following Zero's instructions.",
  ["1031303_9"]="As I'm working on sending my message, the peculiar ripple strikes again, as if an invisible hand brushes across the shelves. All the books on the bookshelves shudder, and their positions change.",
  ["1031304_1"]="This time, I manage to leave only a few words before the entanglement ends.",
  ["1031304_2"]="We still have one more chance. Let's go.",
  ["1031305_1"]="The entanglement has ended. I was intending to leave \"Doom is fated. Get out of here,\" but I only had the time to complete the first half.",
  ["1031305_2"]="Zero shows no regret on her face. At that moment, I realize that she already knew how it would turn out but still entertained my desperate ideas, even in such a dire situation.",
  ["1031305_3"]="What resides within the light cone is destined.",
  ["1031305_4"]="Even if we can change the past, it is destined.",
  ["1031305_5"]="It's a simple truth, but humans can't resist trying to defy destiny and end up becoming its slaves.",
  ["1031305_6"]="Let's keep moving.",
  ["1031305_7"]="Yeah.",
  ["1031306_1"]="More and more Formless are swarming in.",
  ["1031306_2"]="At this rate, Ereshan might not make it before our past selves come to help her.",
  ["1031306_3"]="Let's go help her.",
  ["1031306_4"]="Just let nature take its course.",
  ["1031306_5"]="Sure.",
  ["1031306_6"]="If we let Ereshan bite the dust here, her whole betrayal thing wouldn't have happened in the first place, and Aten wouldn't have been activated. All the conflicts would be wiped out once and for all.",
  ["1031306_7"]="I clench my fists, trying to push away memories of the moments I shared with Ereshan and her helping hand reaching out to me.",
  ["1031306_8"]="...",
  ["1031306_9"]="I'm sorry, but I'm not following your advice this time.",
  ["1031307_1"]="Do not trust Ereshan has been shortened to \"Do not trust her\" due to lack of time.",
  ["1031307_2"]="The distortion is over. This bookshelf now contains the books only from this time sector.",
  ["1031307_3"]="Let's go.",
  ["201101_1"]="Hmm? I think I just heard a noise from that bookshelf.",
  ["201102_1"]="This is what happens to the lost ones.",
  ["201102_2"]="No need to feel sorry for them. They're merely byproducts that the Library has not fully digested.",
  ["201103_1"]="The direction of gravity has suddenly changed...",
  ["201103_2"]="Are we walking on walls?",
  ["201103_3"]="Relax, the laws of physics in the Library do not work the same as in reality.",
  ["201103_4"]="Let's keep moving.",
  ["201104_1"]="That marking... It must be Ere's doing.",
  ["201105_1"]="This is the second time.",
  ["201105_2"]="You've noticed it, too, [BBNAME]? Something feels off about that bookshelf.",
  ["201106_1"]="Looking pretty awful there, Zero.",
  ["201106_2"]="Are you in such a rush to seek my shelter?",
  ["201106_3"]="No, not me. It is Seer who wants to meet you, and I am merely following orders given by [BBNAME].",
  ["201106_4"]="Heh...",
  ["201107_1"]="Rather than wasting time arguing with me, focus instead on the situation at hand, Ere.",
  ["201107_2"]="Huh?",
  ["201107_3"]="Where did you learn these boring lines from?",
  ["201107_4"]="Did Cosmos teach you that?",
  ["201108_1"]="Tsk... so annoying.",
  ["201108_2"]="Don't interrupt me while I'm talking!",
  ["201109_1"]="The pendant... it's glowing.",
  ["201110_1"]="It seems you have the ability to freeze the flow of time in a small area within the Library... Perhaps this power can be of use.",
  ["201111_1"]="Remember, follow <color=#FEC66B>the passage with the most orderly arranged bookshelves</color>, and you will find a way out.",
  ["201112_1"]="That is not the way. Choose your path carefully.",
  ["201113_1"]="That is the wrong way.",
  ["201201_1"]="How are we supposed to find Tasny?",
  ["201201_2"]="I mean, this place shows all the possible moments of every second, right?",
  ["201201_3"]="You think just finding the right time will lead us to the right person?",
  ["201202_1"]="Pfft, I hope you guys won't bore me to death.",
  ["201203_1"]="Where should we go now?",
  ["201203_2"]="You asking me for directions?",
  ["201203_3"]="Who else would I ask? Aren't you the \"Seer\" or something?",
  ["201203_4"]="Seriously? You don't know where to go either?",
  ["201204_1"]="We're stuck here.",
  ["201206_1"]="This place looks impassable to me.",
  ["201206_2"]="Huh? Why don't we just smash through it?",
  ["201208_1"]="Hmm? What's this stuff?",
  ["201209_1"]="What the heck is this? A typewriter? Why is it making noise by itself?",
  ["201210_1"]="How are we supposed to find Tasny?",
  ["201210_2"]="I know how to find him. Just follow my lead.",
  ["201211_1"]="Don't worry. This is Mer. I fixed him up, and he's a good boy.",
  ["201211_2"]="He'll protect you.",
  ["201212_1"]="Let's go down the stairs.",
  ["201213_1"]="It's not the right way, but a little exploring couldn't hurt.",
  ["201213_2"]="You just can't resist being curious, can you?",
  ["201214_1"]="A dead end.",
  ["201214_2"]="It's not a dead end. You know what to do, bloodline of Cosmos.",
  ["201214_3"]="Don't talk like you know me so well.",
  ["201215_1"]="Who's that Enki you mentioned earlier?",
  ["201215_2"]="He's my younger brother.",
  ["201215_3"]="He ventured down the Path of No Return before I did.",
  ["201215_4"]="I went out to find him and bring him back.",
  ["201215_5"]="But now it looks like... I failed.",
  ["201216_1"]="Let's move upward.",
  ["201217_1"]="Why did you say you failed?",
  ["201217_2"]="Because your partner already told me the answer.",
  ["201217_3"]="Those who embark on the that path will be removed from the list of librarians.",
  ["201217_4"]="The Library's \"prophecies\" are bound to happen.",
  ["201217_5"]="All those \"prophecies\" are predetermined facts.",
  ["201218_1"]="The director's office is on the other side of this area.",
  ["201218_2"]="Let's head in that direction.",
  ["201219_1"]="That's the wrong order.",
  ["201219_2"]="Didn't I tell you already? Start with the <color=#FEC66B>darkest side</color>.",
  ["201220_1"]="Yeah, keep arranging books like this.",
  ["201221_1"]="The gate should be open now.",
  ["201221_2"]="What's the point of setting up such a contraption?",
  ["201221_3"]="Because the one Enki fears will calm down after things are sorted.",
  ["201222_1"]="Looks like we'll have to deal with some problems before finding Tasny.",
  ["201223_1"]="Go check under the desk.",
  ["201223_2"]="There, you'll find the \"answer\" you're seeking.",
  ["201224_1"]="In a specific order?",
  ["201224_2"]="Yeah.",
  ["201224_3"]="I'm sure you've noticed the <color=#FEC66B>darkest side</color>.",
  ["201224_4"]="The moon never turns its back on us. She's always accustomed to tidying up everything from that direction.",
  ["201224_5"]="Start with the <color=#FEC66B>darkest side</color> and place the books back on the center shelf in a <color=#FEC66B>clockwise</color> order.",
  ["201226_1"]="Leave it to me.",
  ["201227_1"]="Enki! Stop right there!",
  ["201227_2"]="Mer! Catch him!",
  ["201301_1"]="If I catch that pesky brat, I'll give him a beating he won't forget.",
  ["201302_1"]="Why is this area in shambles? Is it abandoned?",
  ["201303_1"]="That must be the marking Master Enki left behind.",
  ["201303_2"]="Let's follow it.",
  ["201305_1"]="We have made it to the <color=#FEC66B>Hall of Keys</color>.",
  ["201305_2"]="The access mentioned by Master Enki must be here.",
  ["201307_1"]="Something seems to be spinning in the center.",
  ["201308_1"]="Can you stop it, Seer?",
  ["201309_1"]="The Unknown Sector can be fascinating, filled with remnants left behind by those who ventured onto the Path of No Return.",
  ["201310_1"]="What's this? Looks like it could come in handy.",
  ["201311_1"]="The conference hall is just below. Let's keep moving.",
  ["201312_1"]="All things have names. Names wield power, shaping their existence and binding their essence...",
  ["201312_10"]="But it's intriguing how humans managed to control the Anomaly. The people of Memphis were truly bold.",
  ["201312_2"]="What do you think?",
  ["201312_3"]="Names carry significance.",
  ["201312_4"]="Names can act as a form of bondage in a way.",
  ["201312_5"]="I don't understand a word, but it's mind-blowing.",
  ["201312_6"]="...",
  ["201312_7"]="What nonsense are you spouting?",
  ["201312_8"]="Yes, a name... it can become a form of \"bondage\" in a sense.",
  ["201312_9"]="Hahahaha, I'm starting to like you even more now.",
  ["201313_1"]="I see. Those mortals attempted to list all the instructions of the gods through the Method of exhaustion. That was their secret to deciphering the language of gods.",
  ["201313_2"]="Let's forget for a moment how absurd it was for them to treat a brass ball as their god in this case.",
  ["201313_3"]="Human ambition is only admirable in moments like these.",
  ["201314_1"]="It seems most of those who knew the secrets of Ehtaton were killed by the Pharaoh.",
  ["201314_2"]="No wonder nothing related to Aten has survived to this day.",
  ["201314_3"]="Once people obtain great power, it's common for them to seek monopolization.",
  ["201315_1"]="It seems there are only two fundamental units in the so-called language of gods.",
  ["201315_2"]="What do you think those units are?",
  ["201315_3"]="If those units are numbers...",
  ["201315_4"]="I believe I've grasped the truth behind the language of gods.",
  ["201315_5"]="I think I've figured out the answer.",
  ["201315_6"]="Me too, but let's keep the suspense for a last-minute revelation.",
  ["201316_1"]="This must be the end of Ehtaton.",
  ["201316_2"]="The truth behind Ehtaton's downfall...",
  ["201316_3"]="What? Why such a grave look on your face?",
  ["201316_4"]="Pfft, get used to it. Such is the underlying current of history, the truth of our world.",
  ["201316_5"]="It's too late to feel scared or find it absurd.",
  ["201316_6"]="What you're about to encounter... it's all part of these \"absurdities.\"",
  ["201317_1"]="Finally, we're almost to the conference room.",
  ["201317_2"]="Let's hope that runt has found the words to stop Aten from blowing itself up, or I'll... hmph.",
  ["201318_1"]="Watch out. We're entering the Unknown Sector.",
  ["201319_1"]="Ah...! Not this annoying place again!",
  ["201401_1"]="Hey, pesky brat! How am I supposed to make this monster stop?",
  ["201401_2"]="Attack the clockwork behind it! That powers the entire mechanism!",
  ["201402_1"]="Wait, we can make good use of this large gear.",
  ["201403_1"]="You're breaking the cat's cradle!",
  ["201403_2"]="Shut up! Break it, Zero!",
  ["201404_1"]="Don't get any closer, Ere. Something is off about that clock.",
  ["201404_2"]="I don't need you reminding me, okay!",
  ["201404_3"]="So, your \"cat's cradle\" here is equipped with a Star Annihilator?",
  ["201404_4"]="Technically, it's a plasma ray emitter for cleaning purposes!",
  ["201406_1"]="Stay close to me. This place is dangerous.",
  ["202001_1"]="The Unknown Sector has changed, so the rules we know might not apply anymore.",
  ["202002_1"]="This hellhole is truly unpredictable... we need to figure out new rules before finding a way out.",
  ["202003_1"]="This is the currency used in this era.",
  ["202003_2"]="Even on the other side of the continent, the people in Obed were using Japheth's currency. It really shows who held the true power back then.",
  ["202004_1"]="Be cautious of Japheth, right? It's a shame the ruler of this era didn't pay attention to that advice.",
  ["202005_1"]="Halt, or you'll end up like those sacrifices hanging there...",
  ["202008_1"]="The group of Japhethians that just left didn't head this way. These tracks must have been left by a different group of Japhethians.",
  ["202009_1"]="Turns out it's just a shabby chair. How ridiculous! He actually gave up his throne for a chance at negotiations.",
  ["202009_2"]="Hey, you! Yeah, I'm talking to you. Quit taking gems from that chair! It's a disgrace for someone who's supposed to be a Seer.",
  ["202010_1"]="I am... the King of All Kings.",
  ["202011_1"]="Rise, my warriors! Immortal Army, heed my command!",
  ["202012_1"]="You filthy insects, atone with your lives!",
  ["202013_1"]="Immortal Army, obliterate your enemies!",
  ["202014_1"]="Immortal Army, hurl your spears!",
  ["202015_1"]="Immortal Army, impale your foes!",
  ["2020201_1"]="What a rudimentary, ancient device.",
  ["2020202_1"]="The main path ends here. Let's check out what's below.",
  ["2020203_1"]="Ugh, not even budging? I should have known not to expect anything from this old junk.",
  ["2020401_1"]="Ha, seems like those unwanted Japhethians are having some trouble, too.",
  ["2020401_2"]="So, if we lend them a hand now, they'll be more cooperative, right?",
  ["2020402_1"]="Despite all their fancy talks, they need our help in the end.",
  ["2020501_1"]="Looks like you've had some professional combat training.",
  ["2020501_2"]="Praise-worthy, but your coordination was a total disaster.",
  ["2020502_1"]="You might be good in gladiator battles against beasts, but when it comes to my battle-hardened legion, you're as vulnerable as a kitten before a lion.",
  ["2020502_2"]="Phalanx formation, soldiers! Don't underestimate our foes!",
  ["2020503_1"]="General, monsters are swarming in...",
  ["2020503_2"]="Hold the line! Maintain formation! Wipe out all those monsters and capture those Eme-ans alive.",
  ["2020701_1"]="Those who betray His Majesty will pay with their lives...",
  ["2020701_2"]="In the mighty name of Darius, the King of All Kings.",
  ["2020702_1"]="It's those pesky creatures again. Hey, use you time-stopping ability on them.",
  ["2020901_1"]="Wait, isn't that the shoddy artifact that wouldn't even start? So, is it working now?",
  ["2020902_1"]="Those who... offer themselves to His Majesty... will be rewarded... a hundredfold.",
  ["2020903_1"]="There are still people over there.",
  ["2020903_2"]="I don't expect to find any living people we can reason with, but let's go check it out anyway.",
  ["2021001_1"]="Gods, if you actually exist... why did you stay silent... when His Majesty asked his questions...?",
  ["2021002_1"]="That's Farhad, a member of the scout squad.",
  ["2021002_2"]="Maybe he's found something? Hurry! Bring him before His Majesty!",
  ["2021201_1"]="Those are Japheth soldiers.",
  ["2021201_2"]="Looks like they're in a tough spot, too.",
  ["2021202_1"]="This... this is just too weak.",
  ["2021203_1"]="A mark left by a greatsword... Seems like the general has faced some tough enemies in this place.",
  ["2021204_1"]="Our strength isn't enough to break through this stone gate.",
  ["2021205_1"]="This antique isn't working either.",
  ["2021301_1"]="The one surrounded up ahead is... Sarvis.",
  ["2021301_2"]="Let's wait until he's worn out, and then we'll have the perfect chance to strike. Hey, why are you giving me that look? Alright, fine, we'll rescue him.",
  ["2021301_3"]="Oh, it's you.",
  ["2021301_4"]="Thank you for your help, Eme-ans.",
  ["2021301_5"]="I apologize for my rudeness earlier, and I would like to do my best to clear up the misunderstanding I caused.",
  ["2021301_6"]="But I'm afraid we don't have time for that now.",
  ["2021401_1"]="Our strength isn't enough to break through this gate.",
  ["2021401_2"]="This gate is heavy. Please stand back.",
  ["2021402_1"]="Thank goodness we didn't fight him earlier.",
  ["2021402_2"]="Sorry, I couldn't hear you because of the noise. What did you say?",
  ["2021402_3"]="Oh, it's nothing.",
  ["2021403_1"]="I think I've been here before. The path on the right leads back to where I came from.",
  ["2021404_1"]="The door's been breached. Let's follow him and not waste time dealing with those creatures.",
  ["2021405_1"]="Tsk, they've started following us before I even noticed. What a bunch of eyesores.",
  ["2030301_1"]="That's the way we came from.",
  ["2030301_2"]="This place keeps changing. We need to figure out how to reach over there.",
  ["2030302_1"]="Gravity is reversed. Be careful.",
  ["2030303_1"]="The sensor is right here. We need to activate it with a touch.",
  ["2030304_1"]="We can use these sensors to change the status of those platforms.",
  ["2030304_2"]="Adjust their height and create a path to the central console.",
  ["2030401_1"]="Watch out for the beams.",
  ["2030402_1"]="Once the bridge connects, we can move on to the next module.",
  ["2030801_1"]="The path to the console for the first module is blocked.",
  ["2030801_2"]="We need to find a way to lower this barrier. Hmm... Are there sensors up there?",
  ["2030802_1"]="Nanna, the space.",
  ["2030802_2"]="Yeah, I know. Things are getting tricky.",
  ["2030901_1"]="The control hub for the arithmetic module is up on that platform, but this place is like a labyrinth. I need to figure out how to navigate it.",
  ["2031001_1"]="We need to open that door to access the console for the last module.",
  ["2031101_1"]="All the modules are connected now. Let's hurry back and reboot the central computer.",
  ["2031301_1"]="Let's go ahead and check things out.",
  ["2031303_1"]="That was...",
  ["2031304_1"]="That's a trace left by Aten. Let's follow it.",
  ["2031305_1"]="Watch out.",
  ["2031306_1"]="Remember? The second suspicious bookshhelf is right here.",
  ["2031307_1"]="The third bookshelf is over there, but we can't reach it just yet.",
  ["2031307_2"]="Try activating the console over there.",
  ["2031308_1"]="The consoles in both time sectors must be turned on.",
  ["2031309_1"]="Let's follow Aten's traces and keep pushing forward.",
  ["2031310_1"]="Ereshan... she can't hear us. That's her in another time sector before the Library collapsed. We can observe them because we are the singularities.",
  ["2031310_2"]="Hmm? Who's there?",
  ["2031311_1"]="Hmm? Who's there?",
  ["2031312_1"]="Smash that pillar. It'll hold these things back.",
  ["2031314_1"]="Farewell, Ereshan.",
  ["2031315_1"]="Now I understand. We were the ones who broke the doorway and stopped Sarvis from attacking us.",
  ["2031316_1"]="Be careful. It's not safe here.",
  ["2031701_1"]="We've got to stop it right now.",
  ["2031702_1"]="Verification has started. Let's catch up to it.",
  ["2031703_1"]="And keep sending commands. Don't let it run away.",
  ["2201101_1"]="Well, well, if it isn't the almighty time machine, the backbone of Eme-an, and the new director of the Library of Babel?",
  ["2201101_10"]="Yeah, that's why I called you here.",
  ["2201101_2"]="Didn't expect you to come to me. Are you here to show off your authority as the director?",
  ["2201101_3"]="Are you being sarcastic?",
  ["2201101_4"]="Do you have something for me?",
  ["2201101_5"]="What are you even talking about?",
  ["2201101_6"]="No, I have nothing for you at all.",
  ["2201101_7"]="So, Eme-an is so short-staffed that the director has to handle librarian duties now?",
  ["2201101_8"]="You mean, someone else should be taking care of the handover work?",
  ["2201101_9"]="Oh? You've finally realized that?",
  ["2201102_1"]="Oh, it's you.",
  ["2201102_10"]="Fine... I'll just wait a bit...",
  ["2201102_11"]="I see... I'll go find him.",
  ["2201102_2"]="I do have a favor to ask.",
  ["2201102_3"]="But I'm not sure... now is the right time to bring it up...",
  ["2201102_4"]="What is it?",
  ["2201102_5"]="Another librarian is supposed to be here... for the handover.",
  ["2201102_6"]="Maybe he'll show up soon.",
  ["2201102_7"]="Or maybe he'll never show up at all.",
  ["2201102_8"]="I can't tell if his absence is intentional or due to external factors.",
  ["2201102_9"]="Perhaps I've waited a bit too long...",
  ["2201103_1"]="...",
  ["2201103_2"]="...",
  ["2201103_3"]="...",
  ["2201103_4"]="...",
  ["2201103_5"]="...",
  ["2201103_6"]="Librarian.",
  ["2201103_7"]="Missing.",
  ["2201103_8"]="Do I need to find him?",
  ["2201103_9"]="Yes.",
  ["2201104_1"]="It seems the librarian who was supposed to be here for the handover is missing, and I need to bring him back.",
  ["2201105_1"]="I'll have to sift through all the sarcastic remarks to find something useful.",
  ["2201105_2"]="Looks like a note left by the librarian... Seems like he has been here.",
  ["2201106_1"]="I don't understand what she meant... Was that a \"yes\" or \"no\"? Or something in between?",
  ["2201106_2"]="What did he respond? Silence?",
  ["2201106_3"]="Looks like a note left by the librarian... Seems like he has been here.",
  ["2201107_1"]="Some day after I became the Head Librarian of Eme-an, Viola, Ereshan, and Shamash surprisingly came to me at the same time...",
  ["2201107_2"]="I wonder why they all suddenly came to me...",
  ["2201107_3"]="And why are they all just standing there, staring at me?",
  ["2201107_4"]="Anyway, let's go ask them.",
  ["2201108_1"]="I never thought this \"handover\" work would be so challenging. Maybe I'll have to find that legendary book to make everything easier.",
  ["2201108_2"]="Was he trying to... <color=#fec66b>find a book</color>?",
  ["2201108_3"]="He rushed off to find the book. In that case, he must have left <color=#fec66b>a mess of books behind</color>.",
  ["2201109_1"]="<color=#fec66b>Let's walk on the path covered in books.</color>",
  ["2201110_1"]="Finally...",
  ["2201110_2"]="I can't thank you enough. Oh! You are...!",
  ["2201110_3"]="The almighty time machine, the backbone of Eme-an, and the new director of the Library of Babel!",
  ["2201110_4"]="...",
  ["2201111_1"]="Looks like the librarian didn't go this way. It's better to look for an exit related to <color=#fec66b>books</color>.",
  ["2202101_1"]="I talked to Ereshan, Viola, and Shamash, and they told me that the librarian responsible for the handover work went missing.",
  ["2202101_10"]="Did you... have any doubts during your communication?",
  ["2202101_11"]="No, everything seemed fine.",
  ["2202101_12"]="Well, I had a bit of trouble during our conversation.",
  ["2202101_13"]="You're simply awesome, Director...",
  ["2202101_14"]="Just \"a bit\" of trouble... I see...",
  ["2202101_15"]="Honestly, I couldn't communicate with them at all.",
  ["2202101_16"]="I thought I was a good communicator until I met them...",
  ["2202101_17"]="Communication issues can stem from both sides, but if I have trouble talking to all of them, then the problem must be with me, right?",
  ["2202101_18"]="I heard that the former director, Tasny, came up with the Complete Language that could solve any communication problem.",
  ["2202101_19"]="I thought that if I found the Complete Language, all my communication problems would be solved.",
  ["2202101_2"]="Now I have found him.",
  ["2202101_20"]="With that in mind, I went in search of the book...",
  ["2202101_21"]="And you know what happened. If you hadn't shown up in time, I would have...",
  ["2202101_22"]="So, could I ask you to help me search for the book?",
  ["2202101_23"]="Let's go.",
  ["2202101_24"]="Thank you!",
  ["2202101_3"]="Hopefully, the previous ordeal didn't have a lasting impact on him.",
  ["2202101_4"]="Thank you so much for saving my skin!",
  ["2202101_5"]="Still, I wonder how you managed to find me?",
  ["2202101_6"]="(Explain how you found him.)",
  ["2202101_7"]="I see... Ereshan, Viola, and Shamash asked you to look for me...",
  ["2202101_8"]="...",
  ["2202101_9"]="So, you've already talked with them...",
  ["2202102_1"]="When you can't sleep at night, thinking about the frustration you felt when you lost a debate...",
  ["2202102_2"]="...",
  ["2202102_3"]="If I were to use such techniques...",
  ["2202102_4"]="It would only add more unnecessary arguments to the already challenging handover work, right...?",
  ["2202102_5"]="Let's keep looking for the Complete Language!",
  ["2202103_1"]="You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law...",
  ["2202103_2"]="...",
  ["2202103_3"]="...",
  ["2202103_4"]="...",
  ["2202103_5"]="But silence alone won't solve my problems!",
  ["2202103_6"]="Let's keep looking for the Complete Language.",
  ["2202104_1"]="Whether you turn right or left, she will not question your choice, but how can you be so sure about your choice?",
  ["2202104_2"]="...",
  ["2202104_3"]="At least we can be sure this book isn't what we're looking for.",
  ["2202105_1"]="One of Tasny's masterpieces, designed to introduce a new language that eliminates all misunderstandings and ambiguities...",
  ["2202105_2"]="That's it!",
  ["2202106_1"]="Th-this is the legendary Complete Language!",
  ["2202106_10"]="Hey, cheer up.",
  ["2202106_11"]="...",
  ["2202106_12"]="Thank you for your kind words.",
  ["2202106_13"]="But I just had a better idea!",
  ["2202106_14"]="I'm going to create a new language specifically for communicating with Ereshan, Viola, and Shamash, based on their communication styles.",
  ["2202106_15"]="And it'll be called \"A Specialized Language That Disarms Ereshan's Sarcasm, Clarifies Viola's Ambiguities, and Unveils Shamash's Silence\"!",
  ["2202106_16"]="Sure, go for it!",
  ["2202106_17"]="That's quite a mouthful for a name!",
  ["2202106_18"]="He feels revitalized, even though he still has to face the challenging handover job upon his return...",
  ["2202106_19"]="But I believe that one day, he will finish this masterpiece of whatever language and finally find some relief from his suffering.",
  ["2202106_2"]="He opens the book.",
  ["2202106_3"]="...",
  ["2202106_4"]="...",
  ["2202106_5"]="...",
  ["2202106_6"]="And then he closes the book.",
  ["2202106_7"]="I don't get it.",
  ["2202106_8"]="Not at all. I can't make sense of even a single word.",
  ["2202106_9"]="That's not surprising. If the Complete Language were easy to understand, the former director would have made it popular worldwide ages ago...",
  ["2203101_1"]="Some day after I became the Head Librarian of Eme-an, I met Enki, whom I hadn't seen in a long time.",
  ["2203101_2"]="Lately, I've been dealing with my old insomnia. I haven't had a decent night's sleep in over two weeks.",
  ["2203101_3"]="Since you're going to the Library anyway, why don't you help me find my Multi-Button Self-Regulating Rhythmic Hypnotizer along the way?",
  ["2203101_4"]="Hey, why looking at me like you've never heard of it? Oh, right, you don't call it by that name. What do idiots call it? The Truth Verifier? Yeah, that's it!",
  ["2203101_5"]="If you don't know where to find it, just ask the dimwits you know! They're the ones who kept all the stuff I left behind.",
  ["2203101_6"]="Your Master Enki is too busy for such trivial matters! I'm leaving it to you!",
  ["2203102_1"]="(Ask Viola about it.)",
  ["2203102_2"]="The Truth Verifier? Hmm, I think I've heard about it somewhere, but it's been locked away years ago.",
  ["2203102_3"]="Why, you ask? I'm not sure. That happened before I joined Eme-an.",
  ["2203103_1"]="(Ask Shamash about it.)",
  ["2203103_2"]="Shamash listens to your request.",
  ["2203103_3"]="...",
  ["2203104_1"]="Ninsar is just up ahead. Go ask her.",
  ["2203105_1"]="(Ask Nanna about it.)",
  ["2203105_10"]="So, we've created a department solely to take care of the machine, ensuring a steady supply of paper and archiving the texts it generates in a timely manner.",
  ["2203105_11"]="The documents it has produced could fill the national library of a small country.",
  ["2203105_12"]="Honestly, I doubt we'll ever see the end of its verification in our lifetime. But once it reaches its ultimate conclusion, it will hold significance beyond any proposition in the history of human logic.",
  ["2203105_13"]="That's far more important than Enki's insomnia, so you'll need to tell him to find another solution for his sleep troubles.",
  ["2203105_2"]="Why do you need the Truth Verifier?",
  ["2203105_3"]="(Explain the reason to Nanna.)",
  ["2203105_4"]="I see. Now it makes sense. But unfortunately, the Truth Verifier has been sealed away and can't be retrieved so easily.",
  ["2203105_5"]="The reason, you ask? Well, it was taken away from Enki because that machine wasn't intended to be a simple sleep aid device.",
  ["2203105_6"]="And we certainly can't just give it back to Enki because he has trouble sleeping.",
  ["2203105_7"]="Plus, it's because of... the last proposition Enki threw at the machine before handing it over.",
  ["2203105_8"]="There are no propositions in the world that this machine can't prove. That vengeful brat hasn't changed even after becoming the director.",
  ["2203105_9"]="As you may know, that proposition has kept the machine running endlessly, and no one has been able to stop or repurpose it.",
  ["2203106_1"]="Oh, Seer? What brings you here?",
  ["2203106_2"]="You look troubled.",
  ["2203106_3"]="(Tell Ninsar about the reason.)",
  ["2203106_4"]="Oh, I see. You're searching for the machine Enki created.",
  ["2203106_5"]="It has been sealed away, as Enheduanna mentioned.",
  ["2203106_6"]="However, Enki made a prototype of that machine.",
  ["2203106_7"]="Although it's not as competent in proving propositions, it works well enough as a sleep aid device.",
  ["2203106_8"]="Head over to the director's office in our time. Enki keeps many of his creations there.",
  ["2203106_9"]="Just be careful. You've seem how dangerous those creations can be.",
  ["2203108_1"]="Let's look for it here.",
  ["2203110_1"]="Huh? You've actually found it! Wait, no, this is not the final model I made!",
  ["2203110_2"]="But never mind, the prototype will do just fine. Let's figure out how to start it up. Here, here, and here... Alright!",
  ["2203110_3"]="*Creak* *Squeak* *Slam* *Bam* *Poof* *BOOM*",
  ["2204101_1"]="The Truth Verifier I finally found for Enki suddenly stopped after being activated. Let's see what tricks Enki has up his sleeve.",
  ["2204101_10"]="Thanks, but no thanks.",
  ["2204101_11"]="Um, actually, I just thought of something else...",
  ["2204101_12"]="Of course, I wouldn't ask you to take over the night shift.",
  ["2204101_13"]="I just remembered that the Library has an endless supply of toilet paper.",
  ["2204101_14"]="If I put that in the paper box...",
  ["2204101_15"]="Enki is talking about a book named \"The Catalog of Paradoxes.\"",
  ["2204101_16"]="The book begins with the statement: \"This book lists only books in this Library that do not list their own titles.\"",
  ["2204101_17"]="So, according to that statement, if the Catalog of Paradoxes lists itself, then it shouldn't be listed in itself.",
  ["2204101_18"]="But if it doesn't list itself, then it should be listed in itself.",
  ["2204101_19"]="Hold on, let me go through it again...",
  ["2204101_2"]="Hey, why did it suddenly stop?",
  ["2204101_20"]="Wait a second, I'm not getting it...",
  ["2204101_21"]="That's not the point.",
  ["2204101_22"]="The point is that it has an infinite number of pages, listing an endless number of eligible books within the Library.",
  ["2204101_23"]="Each page of the Catalog of Paradoxes can be split into two more pages. As a result, nobody has been able to read the entire book, and we can't confirm whether the book contains itself or not.",
  ["2204101_24"]="Yeah, Ninsar is totally right!",
  ["2204101_25"]="How do I know, you ask? Because I've seen it with my own eyes, you idiot!",
  ["2204101_26"]="I found it ages ago, but all it had was a never-ending list of book titles and nothing else...",
  ["2204101_27"]="I couldn't think of any use for it except using it as an endless roll of toilet paper.",
  ["2204101_28"]="So I just left it lying around in some random corner...",
  ["2204101_29"]="Well, I think it was near the module in Sector C4974. I happened to be there gathering information back then.",
  ["2204101_3"]="Did the wire in the input port break? Or did the secondary logic loop get interlocked? Or maybe the gears of the variable analysis discriminator got jammed?",
  ["2204101_4"]="Hey! Ninsar! Come help me sort this out! You're the best at this stuff!",
  ["2204101_5"]="What? Why are you looking at me like I'm an idiot?",
  ["2204101_6"]="It's the same \"idiots\" you loathe who established an entire department dedicated to supplying paper for your stupid machine.",
  ["2204101_7"]="If you want to use it as a sleep aid, you better assign someone to maintain it during the night, or else it'll run out of paper and stop working.",
  ["2204101_8"]="Well, in that case...",
  ["2204101_9"]="Enki turns his gaze to you.",
  ["2204102_1"]="Enki casually tossed a book... with an infinite number of pages...",
  ["2204102_2"]="Let's dig through the messiest pile of books in this room.",
  ["2204103_1"]="This book lists only books in this Library that do not list their own titles.",
  ["2204103_2"]="This must be the Catalog of Paradoxes that Ninsar and Enki were talking about.",
  ["2204103_3"]="Let's bring it to Enki.",
  ["2204104_1"]="Yep, that's it!",
  ["2204104_2"]="With my Multi-Button Self-Regulating Rhythmic Hypnotizer and Infinite Toilet Paper, my insomnia finally has a cure!",
  ["2204104_3"]="You've made an unparalleled contribution to Master Enki's sleep quality. Now my sharp mind can focus on more important things!",
  ["2204104_4"]="Ever since then, the legend of the \"suspicious person walking around in the middle of the night\" that used to circulate among librarians disappeared, but a new legend of a certain machine that \"automatically types in the middle of the night\" started to spread...",
  ["2204105_1"]="Despite my efforts, I couldn't find anything like the Catalog of Paradoxes in that pile.",
  ["2204106_1"]="There's another messy pile over there. Maybe I should go and search through it.",
  ["2204107_1"]="Nope, the Catalog of Paradoxes isn't here.",
  ["2204107_2"]="Instead of the book I want, I stumble upon some unwelcome guests...",
  ["2204108_1"]="An overturned bookshelf is blocking my way...",
  ["2204108_2"]="It takes <color=#fec66b>a bit of force</color> to lift the bookshelf up.",
  ["2204109_1"]="Nope, the Catalog of Paradoxes isn't here.",
  ["2204109_2"]="Instead of the book I want, I stumble upon some unwelcome guests...",
  ["2205101_1"]="So, where should we start?",
  ["2205101_2"]="This difference engine was made in the past, so naturally, we need to restore it using techniques and materials from that time.",
  ["2205101_3"]="Let's gather information about the difference engine and find out when it was created. That'll help us with the repairs.",
  ["2205102_1"]="Enki walks over to the bookshelf and starts searching through it.",
  ["2205102_10"]="Enki.",
  ["2205102_11"]="Once again, you've tampered with something I fixed.",
  ["2205102_12"]="Don't be so mean, sis.",
  ["2205102_13"]="I just made some special adjustments to the lens, making this magnifying glass work like a camera lens.",
  ["2205102_14"]="Considering that the timeline in the Library is just another dimension of space, the past and the present exist simultaneously here.",
  ["2205102_15"]="So, if we position the magnifying glass correctly, we can project fragments of the past, although we can only see brief glimpses for now.",
  ["2205102_16"]="That way, we can directly observe that era and search for clues about the difference engine.",
  ["2205102_17"]="Anyway... be careful and don't break it.",
  ["2205102_2"]="Look, it's mentioned in this book called \"Record of Great Inventions.\" Let's see...",
  ["2205102_3"]="This magnificent difference engine was created by the great mathematician and astronomer <color=#fec66b>Tuttle</color>. He began constructing it in Tower Age 4087, and it took him thirty years to complete and improve it...",
  ["2205102_4"]="The difference engine has been in continuous operation for twenty years, even after Tuttle's death. It is truly the amazing machine that unravels all mysteries and solves all puzzles...",
  ["2205102_5"]="Ugh! Seriously, I can't take it anymore!",
  ["2205102_6"]="This book is boasting so much about a lazy machine that's 115 years old and can't even withstand my minor adjustments!",
  ["2205102_7"]="This book was published twenty-one years after Tuttle's death, written by an Eme-an in a later era. Naturally, it might have some deviations.",
  ["2205102_8"]="Yeah, I guess you're right. Instead of relying on second-hand information, let's take a more direct approach.",
  ["2205102_9"]="Leaving those words behind, Enki pulls out a magnifying glass from his pocket. The light passing through the lens refracts several figures not far away.",
  ["2205103_1"]="Tuttle, I've put all the celestial data you need on the table. Don't forget to pick it up!",
  ["2205103_2"]="Is he greeting the projection over there?",
  ["2205103_3"]="Wait a minute. Celestial data? Tuttle? Isn't that the name of the guy who invented the machine?",
  ["2205103_4"]="Well, the inventor himself is indeed the key clue.",
  ["2205103_5"]="Keep an eye on the projection over there.",
  ["2205104_1"]="When the two of them follow the projection up the steps, the room appears in front of them. It is filled with clutter, ranging from books and scrolls to parts and materials.",
  ["2205104_2"]="Judging from the scene, this must be the research room librarian Tuttle mentioned.",
  ["2205104_3"]="Oh my, you call this a \"research room\"?",
  ["2205104_4"]="Can he really work with books and manuscripts piled up like this?",
  ["2205104_5"]="Why are you so surprised? It looks just as messy as your work table.",
  ["2205104_6"]="What do you mean? What you call \"messy\" is an \"efficient and scattershot distribution\" for me! But this? This is pure chaos!",
  ["2205104_7"]="Don't tell me we're supposed to find clues in this mountain of junk...",
  ["2205104_8"]="Sure.",
  ["2205104_9"]="No matter how messy it is, this is the room where Tuttle keeps his spare parts. Let's start looking for some.",
  ["2205105_1"]="Steam pipes, base materials, and a new type of pulley... Phew, I've finally finished organizing all those suggestions Travis mentioned.",
  ["2205105_2"]="The next step is to go to the <color=#fec66b>workshop</color> and test them one by one.",
  ["2205106_1"]="No, this structure won't withstand the tension...",
  ["2205106_2"]="And this one doesn't work either. Standard arithmetic gears can't handle that much power.",
  ["2205106_3"]="I should head to the <color=#fec66b>workshop</color> and ask Travis about it, and I need to check if we still have enough <color=#fec66b>spare parts</color>.",
  ["2205107_1"]="It's disappointing how everyone gradually gave up on the research of difference engine, and the research room has never seen so few people.",
  ["2205107_2"]="Looks like Travis and I will have to spend more time on the maintenance work in the <color=#fec66b>workshop</color>.",
  ["2205108_1"]="And who is this Travis guy?",
  ["2205108_2"]="According to what the projection said, he was Tuttle's research partner in the field of the difference engine. It's quite common for researchers to collaborate.",
  ["2205108_3"]="But his name was never mentioned in that book. The only name mentioned was Tuttle...",
  ["2205108_4"]="Well, let's not get caught up in the details. We should focus on finding the parts.",
  ["2205108_5"]="Let's go to the <color=#fec66b>workshop</color> Tuttle mentioned so many times.",
  ["2205109_1"]="Alright, let's see what materials Tuttle used.",
  ["2205109_2"]="Enki tries with all his might to open the chest, but it won't budge.",
  ["2205109_3"]="Hold on a second. This crate won't open.",
  ["2205109_4"]="Seriously, it was just a difference engine! Why would he bother locking this crate? It's so petty!",
  ["2205109_5"]="The lock looks worn out. Its owner must have opened it frequently.",
  ["2205109_6"]="Maybe we can try find <color=#fec66b>some clues that Tuttle left behind</color>.",
  ["2205111_1"]="Oh, so this is what Tuttle called an \"arithmetic gear\"?",
  ["2205111_2"]="Looks like it. It's essential for fixing the difference engine.",
  ["2205111_3"]="Let's keep searching for the remaining parts.",
  ["2205112_1"]="Do we need any more parts, sis?",
  ["2205112_2"]="No, we have all the key parts now.",
  ["2205112_3"]="That's quicker than I expected.",
  ["2205112_4"]="Really? It feels too slow to me!",
  ["2205112_5"]="Those stupid librarians called it \"an mazing machine that unravels all mysteries and solves all puzzles...\"",
  ["2205112_6"]="You know what? This machine feels like it's straight out of the Stone Age. Who thought it was a genius idea to design something so clunky?",
  ["2205112_7"]="If I didn't have to reproduce those complicated and crude designs, I could build a brand new one in ten minutes!",
  ["2205112_8"]="Let's just hurry back to the data room and fix the machine.",
  ["2205113_1"]="After some tinkering by Enki, the difference engine seems to be even more damaged.",
  ["2205113_10"]="No.",
  ["2205113_11"]="Do NOT touch the difference engine until I fix it.",
  ["2205113_2"]="The engine now looks like a burnt roast on a barbecue grill, constantly emitting black smoke and crackling noises.",
  ["2205113_3"]="Hmm, weird. Why is this happening?",
  ["2205113_4"]="Theoretically, once we put the pulley module and the arithmetic gear together, it should start working!",
  ["2205113_5"]="Well, forget it. I'll just add ten more powerful furnaces and solve all its problems once and for all.",
  ["2205113_6"]="Enki.",
  ["2205113_7"]="Ninsar gives Enki a serious look and stops him.",
  ["2205113_8"]="Are you planning to blow up the difference engine again?",
  ["2205113_9"]="Ahem, I was just trying to be helpful. Don't worry! This time, I won't...",
  ["2205114_1"]="The two of them return to the room with the materials they collected along the way.",
  ["2205114_2"]="While my sister is busy organizing the materials, let me do some prep work!",
  ["2205201_1"]="This is where Tuttle used to work.",
  ["2205201_2"]="In that era, Eme-an had an Astronomical Society here where they discussed and shared their ideas.",
  ["2205201_3"]="The book \"Record of Great Inventions\" was written by them, and since it includes the difference engine, its inventor Tuttle must have been a member of the society.",
  ["2205201_4"]="Hmm... is there anything special about that society?",
  ["2205201_5"]="Actually, that society existed for less than four decades. Before it disbanded, its members either moved on to other fields of study or ventured into the Path of No Return.",
  ["2205201_6"]="After the last member left, this sector remained untouched and has stayed that way ever since.",
  ["2205201_7"]="Perhaps we can find clues about Tuttle in the society.",
  ["2205202_1"]="That stupid librarian's traces lead to this place, but the entrance is locked.",
  ["2205202_2"]="Wait, there's a sign next to this pile of locks...",
  ["2205202_3"]="Property of the Astronomical Society, accessible to society members only.",
  ["2205202_4"]="Judging by the slots, we need three keys to open this door.",
  ["2205202_5"]="How could Eme-an from a century ago be so unwilling to share?! Now this is great! All those idiots left decades ago. Where are we supposed to find them?",
  ["2205202_6"]="Calm down. This sector was the activity area for the society. Maybe we can still find the keys to the gate here.",
  ["2205202_7"]="Besides, we can gather information about Tuttle.",
  ["2205203_1"]="A letter of application to join the Astronomical Society, probably written by the young Tuttle, judging by the crooked and imprecise handwriting.",
  ["2205204_1"]="A stack of manuscripts covered in mathematical formulas and design drawings, indicating an early version of the difference engine, with Tuttle's signature at the end.",
  ["2205205_1"]="Tuttle, are you still fascinated by that topic?",
  ["2205205_2"]="Looks like everyone in the Society has lost interest. They say you can't find the answer you're looking for through human calculation alone.",
  ["2205205_3"]="I know, Travis. That's why I've decided to build this difference engine.",
  ["2205205_4"]="While a difference engine isn't much faster than humans, it doesn't get tired, and with proper maintenance, it can compute nonstop.",
  ["2205205_5"]="I've finished the preliminary work. Now I just need to set up the initial question.",
  ["2205205_6"]="How long do you think it will take?",
  ["2205205_7"]="Well, I haven't estimated that yet.",
  ["2205205_8"]="I know the question I raised is a bit complicated, but I'm confident that the machine will figure it out after a year or two!",
  ["2205206_1"]="A draft of Tuttle's book, filled with numerous mathematical formulas, along with many red crosses.",
  ["2205207_1"]="Tuttle's book of experiments, featuring a dozen versions of the difference engine blueprints. With each iteration, the \"estimated calculation time\" increases by several years.",
  ["2205208_1"]="Tuttle's star atlas, with a cover displaying a star map and a hand-drawn <color=#fec66b>ellipse</color> running through it.",
  ["2205209_1"]="Letters mailed to Tuttle. The contents show that many society members were interested in his research.",
  ["2205210_1"]="Tuttle's toolbox, containing cleaners, spare gears, and other spare parts for card feeders.",
  ["2205211_1"]="Tuttle's book collection, including reference books on astronomy and machinery, as well as popular novels from that era.",
  ["2205213_1"]="Dear Professor Bessel, & I've read all the materials you gave me last time. &Compared to those assorted books in Delphi, the Astronomy Encyclopedia in Japheth is much easier to understand. &I want to thank you for traveling to a foreign country and collecting those books for me. &With the help of those reference materials, the improvements to the difference engine has been smoother than I expected. &Soon, Travis and I will be able to create a super difference engine specifically designed to simulate the motion of celestial bodies! &  Once that's done, we can officially start computing <color=#fec66b>that question</color>.",
  ["2205213_2"]="About the estimated calculation time you mentioned... &To be honest, we are not entirely sure how long it will take. While I believe five years would be enough, Travis thinks it will take at least ten years. &However, I don't think it is a major concern. &Technology has revolutionized various fields over the past few decades, with Japheth, Delphi, and Cyril at the forefront. &Parts and related technologies will improve, and in a few years, there might be another breakthrough in the field of difference engines, right? &When that happens, I'll make significant modifications to our difference engine, and the calculation won't be a problem by then! &Well, that might be a bit too optimistic... Anyway, I'll continue my research and send you another letter with all the details! & Your Student,& Tuttle",
  ["2205214_1"]="In contrast to his previous appearance, Tuttle now bears the marks of time, and his wrinkled face shows signs of fatigue.",
  ["2205214_2"]="Now that Travis has left too, I'm the only one here.",
  ["2205214_3"]="Well, I can't complain about it. In the tenth year of operation, I had already expected such a result.",
  ["2205214_4"]="The Library is filled with countless gems and surprises, and there's no reason for them to stay here all the time, waiting for this elusive answer.",
  ["2205214_5"]="The figure gazes at the distant stars.",
  ["2205214_6"]="I don't regret the time I've invested in this field. I just fear that I might not live to see the day when the answer is found.",
  ["2205215_1"]="Most photos taken by Tuttle feature the nighttime sky, some capturing stars, while others appear dull and gray.",
  ["2205216_1"]="Various star charts complied by Tuttle, many of which contain hand-drawn <color=#fec66b>arcs</color>.",
  ["2205217_1"]="These drawings depict the structure of Tuttle's difference engine, showcasing significant improvements in its durability.",
  ["2205218_1"]="A sketchbook used by Tuttle, covered in numerous formulas. Numbers in the \"estimated calculation time\" have been written and crossed out repeatedly, concluding with a note: \"More than 50 years.\"",

  ["2205224_1"]="Now, with the new copper wire, its water-cooling cycle system is functioning properly.",
  ["2205224_2"]="*Cough*",
  ["2205224_3"]="Unfortunately, time is running out for me.",
  ["2205224_4"]="Well, my brainchild will search for the answer among the stars in my place.",
  ["2205225_1"]="The desk is well organized with a key placed at the center, as if awaiting a visitor for quite some time.",
  ["2205225_2"]="Next to the key, there's a letter covered in dust.",
  ["2205226_1"]="Dear Travis, &It's surprising that you still remember this old man. How are things going on your end? &As I mentioned in my previous letter, the difference engine we built together is still operating. &The little rascal has become much more stable. Its noise and soot have reduced significantly, and it no longer explodes. &If you ask me, my little rascal is much sturdier than this old man. &Whenever I think about our difference engine, it takes me back to the past. &I was too naive and impulsive back then. We used to have countless arguments over the research. Looking back, those were trivial matters. &Moreover, you were right about my estimation. I was overly optimistic about the calculation.",
  ["2205226_2"]="Since you left, I have made countless iterations and improvements over the decades that followed. &I replaced materials, tweaked the design, and optimized the structure. I tried everything I could think of. &However, no matter how much I improved its efficiency, it saved only a day or two in its 20,000-day calculation time. &Compared to the extensive estimated calculation time, I have very little time left for myself, as age and illness have caught up with me. &The other day, I went to the observatory to gaze at the night sky, only to realize the harsh truth that I could hardly see the stars. &Undoubtedly, the time it would take to get the answer will exceed the remaining days of my life. &Yet, this realization made me understand that instead of focusing on arithmetic efficiency, I should prioritize the endurance of the machine.",
  ["2205226_3"]="Indeed, 20,000 days may seem like an eternity, but it's not, and the calculation will eventually come to an end. &While I won't live long enough to witness the answer, Eme-an of future generations will. &Since we won't get the answer in this era, I will find a way to keep the machine running endlessly. &As a result, I have shifted the focus of my research in the recent years. &I have adopted more heat-resistant materials, more energy-efficient gear sets, and a more stable cooling system. &That way, our brainchild will continue running for several more decades, right? &Ha, I can already imagine you laughing at my naive ideas. &Yeah, I understand. In the end, it's just a childhood wish of mine, precious yet insignificant. &If only you had been under those stars back then... then you would have understood. & Yours,& Tuttle",
  ["2205227_1"]="It seems that what librarian Tuttle had been chasing his whole life is actually a wish that originated in his childhood.",
  ["2205227_10"]="Didn't he consider the possibility that future Eme-ans wouldn't understand what an ancient scholar from a century ago wanted to discover?",
  ["2205227_11"]="Even if we got the answer now, we wouldn't know what question it actually answers.",
  ["2205227_12"]="No need to worry. The answer is almost within our grasp.",
  ["2205227_13"]="She walks over to the desk and picks up the final key.",
  ["2205227_14"]="It's time to open the gate to the society and unveil the truth.",
  ["2205227_2"]="In service to his wish, he accepted the reality that he wouldn't see the answer in his lifetime and shifted his focus to improving his machine.",
  ["2205227_3"]="As Ninsar puts down the envelope, a manuscript falls out.",
  ["2205227_4"]="The manuscript is covered in arithmetic formulas, but no answers are provided.",
  ["2205227_5"]="Since we won't get the answer in this era, I plan to keep the difference engine running as long as possible and leave the answer for future Eme-ans.",
  ["2205227_6"]="That was the approach Librarian Tuttle found in his later years.",
  ["2205227_7"]="No wonder... that explains how this poorly designed difference engine managed to keep running for so long.",
  ["2205227_8"]="However...",
  ["2205227_9"]="That stupid librarian put so much effort into the machine, but why didn't he describe his question more clearly?",
  ["2205301_1"]="Song of the Stars",
  ["2205301_10"]="Judging by these objects, this place used to be the observatory of the Astronomical Society.",
  ["2205301_11"]="The Library has rearranged the observatory from different eras throughout history, resulting in its current state.",
  ["2205301_12"]="Finding Tuttle's traces here might be quite a challenge...",
  ["2205301_13"]="Hey, Mom, Dad! Come over here!",
  ["2205301_14"]="Both of them turn their attention towards the source of the voice.",
  ["2205301_15"]="Standing in front of them is a boy they have never seen before, yet he feels strangely familiar.",
  ["2205301_2"]="What's this?",
  ["2205301_3"]="As soon as Enki steps into the room, the scenery before his eyes starts shifting and rotating like a slideshow, blurring time and space.",
  ["2205301_4"]="Whoah...",
  ["2205301_5"]="Before Enki can steady himself, a chaotic stream of countless librarians rushes past him, threatening to engulf him.",
  ["2205301_6"]="Hold my hand.",
  ["2205301_7"]="It is only when he feels the familiar warmth in his palm that those phantoms spanning time and space dissipate.",
  ["2205301_8"]="Phew... Th-that was a close call.",
  ["2205301_9"]="Why would the Unknown Sector be hiding behind the gate of the society?",
  ["2205302_1"]="The projection tilts his head and looks up at the night sky.",
  ["2205302_2"]="Even though the dark sky is filled with only a few lonely stars, the boy's eyes reflect a myriad of lights.",
  ["2205302_3"]="Mom and Dad, look! The night sky is sparkling! It's like it's raining stars!",
  ["2205302_4"]="When I grow up...",
  ["2205302_5"]="Mom and Dad... you'll show me a sight like this again!",
  ["2205302_6"]="No, I'll show you a sight like this again!",
  ["2205303_1"]="As time goes by, Tuttle grows into a young man.",
  ["2205303_2"]="The innocence and curiosity of his childhood fade away, replaced by unwavering determination.",
  ["2205303_3"]="Trust me, Travis. I will create that difference engine.",
  ["2205303_4"]="And on the day I discover the answer, I'll share it with all of you! Heehee!",
  ["2205304_1"]="The observatory feels so cold now, with Tuttle as the only person there.",
  ["2205304_2"]="The dark night at the observatory remains cold and silent, but Tuttle has aged.",
  ["2205304_3"]="In his eyes, which once gazed at the stars, only the fading embers of a dying fire remain.",
  ["2205304_4"]="The observatory feels so cold now, with Tuttle as the only person there.",
  ["2205304_5"]="I'll wait forever...",
  ["2205304_6"]="Even if I can't witness the answer...",
  ["2205305_1"]="The old man named Tuttle stands still, calmly gazing at the passage he came through.",
  ["2205305_2"]="The night sky above him feels both desolate and serene.",
  ["2205305_3"]="Oh, future Eme-an, if you're lucky enough to obtain the answer...",
  ["2205305_4"]="Please listen to the voice of the stars... in my stead...",
  ["2205306_1"]="As the stars streak across the sky, the night falls into complete silence.",
  ["2205306_10"]="While Enki is thoroughly enjoying himself, Ninsar remains calm.",
  ["2205306_11"]="Her words lack regret and delight.",
  ["2205306_12"]="In the hindsight, Librarian Tuttle's perseverance was indeed commendable.",
  ["2205306_13"]="However, dedicating his entire lifetime to a childhood dream, a meteor shower that would never occur in his lifetime...",
  ["2205306_14"]="Well, that wasn't the wisest decision.",
  ["2205306_15"]="Enki chuckles and shakes his head.",
  ["2205306_16"]="You're getting all sentimental, sis.",
  ["2205306_17"]="Aren't all Eme-an idiots like that?",
  ["2205306_18"]="Throughout history, no Eme-an has ever figured out the Library's secrets, but that didn't stop them from going on the Path of No Return.",
  ["2205306_19"]="Not everyone values finding answers as much as you do, sis.",
  ["2205306_2"]="Bidding farewell to the slumbering observatory, the two of them retrace their steps and return to the sector they came from.",
  ["2205306_20"]="Ninsar glances at the drawings on the table.",
  ["2205306_21"]="But those Eme-ans were seeking the end of the Library.",
  ["2205306_22"]="Even if both endeavors were futile, they had different starting points.",
  ["2205306_23"]="Enki chuckles.",
  ["2205306_24"]="What, sis? You think some fools are smarter than others?",
  ["2205306_25"]="In my book, even if someone reaches the end of the Library and uncovers the ultimate truth of the universe, it's not that big a deal.",
  ["2205306_26"]="Because it's no different from watching a meteor shower. It all comes from that natural curiosity we have about the unknown.",
  ["2205306_27"]="Or rather, isn't it even rarer to be an Eme-an like him who resists the grandeur of the Library and focuses on studying meteor showers?",
  ["2205306_28"]="...",
  ["2205306_29"]="However, I kicked him out of the \"idiot club\" for another reason.",
  ["2205306_3"]="I see... so that's how it is.",
  ["2205306_30"]="What reason is that?",
  ["2205306_31"]="Enki resumes his usual indifference.",
  ["2205306_32"]="Because among all those idiots, he was particularly skilled in mechanics!",
  ["2205306_33"]="I never expected him to invent such an excellent cooling system just to calculate meteor showers. With some new sprinklers, that difference engine could be turned into an automatic watering device!",
  ["2205306_34"]="In that case, I can keep some flowers and plants in the future!",
  ["2205306_35"]="Fine, I shouldn't have expected anything profound from you.",
  ["2205306_36"]="But then again.",
  ["2205306_37"]="You knew the answer from the beginning, didn't you, sis?",
  ["2205306_38"]="Ninsar pauses for a moment, then nods briskly.",
  ["2205306_39"]="Sure.",
  ["2205306_4"]="The interconnected gears calculate the trajectory of the comet, the steam cycle replicates the Earth's rotation, and the punched tape simulates celestial dust.",
  ["2205306_40"]="I thought you would have figured it out earlier.",
  ["2205306_41"]="I knew it long ago, but I didn't tell you about it just in case you might want to spoil the surprise.",
  ["2205306_42"]="But why didn't you help me more if you knew the answer? I've been busy searching for parts and fixing machines! I thought I'd have to go through his childhood diaries!",
  ["2205306_43"]="Ninsar's lips curl into a subtle smile.",
  ["2205306_44"]="The process is more important than the answer. Isn't that your motto?",
  ["2205306_45"]="Well, now I get it... Watching you scramble around the Library has been way more entertaining than just giving you the answer.",
  ["2205306_46"]="Plus, I've been helping you, haven't I?",
  ["2205306_47"]="If I hadn't dropped those hints along the way, you would have missed the meteor shower for sure, my clueless brother.",
  ["2205306_48"]="Well, despite your words, it seems like you just wanted an excuse to hang out with me, silly sis.",
  ["2205306_49"]="Why make everything so complicated when you can just be straightforward and honest?",
  ["2205306_5"]="If we assume that he wanted to calculate when the next meteor shower would happen, then the weird design of the machine makes perfect sense.",
  ["2205306_50"]="Ninsar chuckles.",
  ["2205306_51"]="Think of it as payment for fixing the difference engine.",
  ["2205306_52"]="By the way, aren't you planning to modify your automatic sprinkler system? Why waste your time arguing with me about this?",
  ["2205306_53"]="Upon hearing Ninsar's words, Enki adjusts his glasses.",
  ["2205306_54"]="Well, that can wait. I still have one more thing to do.",
  ["2205306_55"]="As if remembering something, he picks up the pen from the table and returns to the desk.",
  ["2205306_56"]="The librarian's manuscript still lies quietly on the table, surrounded by calculations and theories from various schools and fields.",
  ["2205306_57"]="Only the space for the answer remains empty.",
  ["2205306_58"]="With a rare moment of seriousness, he signs a few words.",
  ["2205306_59"]="Just as solemn as the author from a century ago.",
  ["2205306_6"]="Unfortunately, he forgot about the impact of solar wind particles on the magnetic field, so the time he calculated was a few minutes early for the actual meteor shower.",
  ["2205306_60"]="On the 70th day of the Tower Age 4202, the meteor shower arrived.",
  ["2205306_61"]="On the 70th day of the Tower Age 4202, the meteor shower arrived.",
  ["2205306_62"]="That's it.",
  ["2205306_63"]="There you go, Librarian Tuttle.",
  ["2205306_7"]="But considering the fact that he was from a century ago, such ignorance can be forgiven. His answer saves him from being labeled as \"stupid.\"",
  ["2205306_8"]="Well, I didn't expect you to be so generous with your praise for him.",
  ["2205306_9"]="Oh? So, you don't agree, my silly sis?",
  ["2205307_1"]="The two of them head up the stairs. The lights of the Library fade into the darkness of the night.",
  ["2205307_10"]="The stars and answers never lie.",
  ["2205307_11"]="Almost as soon as the words leave her lips, a shimmering light streaks across the night sky.",
  ["2205307_12"]="Was that a shooting star?",
  ["2205307_13"]="Two... four... eight... Th-there are so many of them!",
  ["2205307_14"]="One shooting star fades, and several more flare to life.",
  ["2205307_15"]="Like schools of fish leaping from the ocean of stars, shooting stars arc one after another.",
  ["2205307_16"]="The starlight, emanating from distant stars, is outshone by the energy of comet fragments piercing through the atmosphere. Even the aloof star in the far north pales in comparison to the downpour of lights.",
  ["2205307_17"]="The meteor shower transforms into countless fleeting parallel lines, delicately illuminating the canopy above.",
  ["2205307_18"]="Even the projections wandering in the tower seem drawn to the meteor shower, their gaze fixed on the night sky.",
  ["2205307_19"]="Dad, Mom, and Travis... are you seeing this?",
  ["2205307_2"]="The observatory is cold and silent, much like the society that has faded into oblivion. Even as they approach the end, all they see are a few solitary stars.",
  ["2205307_20"]="Finally, those stars have come back...",
  ["2205307_21"]="Across the spiral arms, over the distant stars.",
  ["2205307_22"]="The dust wandering alongside the comet concludes its long journey, falling into the starry sky under the pull of gravity.",
  ["2205307_23"]="The shooting stars, with the longing of the wandering soul from a century ago, streak through the sky above the tower.",
  ["2205307_3"]="A-achoo...",
  ["2205307_4"]="Where are the promised stars and answer? Why is there nothing here?",
  ["2205307_5"]="All our efforts only lead us to this cold and dark observatory, and this place is freezing.",
  ["2205307_6"]="Are you certain we're going in the right direction, sis?",
  ["2205307_7"]="Ninsar gently shakes her head, gazing into the dark night.",
  ["2205307_8"]="It's already within reach.",
  ["2205307_9"]="Don't worry.",
  ["2206101_1"]="Chirp chirp! As the director, you have things you must do!",
  ["2206101_10"]="Hurry up! Fulfill my wish while Zero is away! Seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and maybe I'll put in a good word for you with her!",
  ["2206101_11"]="What does Anchirp mean by that?",
  ["2206101_12"]="Anyway, let's check the director's office for related items.",
  ["2206101_2"]="Your daily duty!",
  ["2206101_3"]="Mandatory!",
  ["2206101_4"]="Chirp! Your goals!",
  ["2206101_5"]="Although I get the brief meaning, as for details...",
  ["2206101_6"]="Can you just be more direct?",
  ["2206101_7"]="Chirp chirp! Why explain everything with words? Not everything can be explained in direct words!",
  ["2206101_8"]="Chirp chirp! And we're connected by tacit understanding! We can understand each other through just a single glance!",
  ["2206101_9"]="(I feel awkward having tacit understanding with a bird.)",
  ["2206103_1"]="...deliberated the calculation for the expansion and cooling of the early universe after the singularity explosion, and used the model...",
  ["2206103_2"]="Chirp!",
  ["2206103_3"]="Geez, do you really not get it? With such a cute bird accompanying you all the way, even a dumb stone would catch on!",
  ["2206103_4"]="Anchirp flaps its wings and chirps, preventing me from continuing to check the contents of the book.",
  ["2206103_5"]="Judging by the books Anchirp landed along the way, could it be that it's been thinking about the meaning of a bird's life? The ultimate purpose? Or perhaps the connection between a bird and the universe?",
  ["2206103_6"]="No, that's still too vague...",
  ["2206103_7"]="Anyway, the author of this essay is Enki Tasny. Perhaps I should just go and ask the author himself.",
  ["2206104_1"]="(Explain the situation to Enki.)",
  ["2206104_10"]="(Turn to Ninsar for help.)",
  ["2206104_11"]="...",
  ["2206104_12"]="Perhaps you should ask its actual owner.",
  ["2206104_13"]="Chirp!",
  ["2206104_14"]="Looks like we'll have to ask Zero then.",
  ["2206104_2"]="Is stupidity contagious?",
  ["2206104_3"]="Whether it's a model illustrating the universe's expansion and cooling caused by the singularity or a thermodynamic equation related to ingredient heating in an oven...",
  ["2206104_4"]="When I calculated the next singularity explosion, it all led me to one conclusion...",
  ["2206104_5"]="This is just a failed cookbook! There's nothing special about it!",
  ["2206104_6"]="But hey, so this chubby chicken does have a name, right? Anchirp, chirp!",
  ["2206104_7"]="I'd never met such an awesome chubby chicken when I was the director. Now, let's take this rare opportunity to do some animal research...",
  ["2206104_8"]="Chirp chirp!",
  ["2206104_9"]="Anchirp lets out a shriek and flies to Ninsar, seeking refuge behind her.",
  ["2206105_1"]="Chirp!",
  ["2206105_2"]="Upon spotting Zero, Anchirp flies over affectionately, circling her before finally settling on her shoulder.",
  ["2206105_3"]="(Explain the situation to Zero.)",
  ["2206105_4"]="...",
  ["2206105_5"]="Ann is simply hungry and wants some popcorn.",
  ["2206105_6"]="Chirp chirp... It says, \"That all that really matters!\"",
  ["2206105_7"]="I can't resist pinching it.",
  ["2206106_1"]="A notice for a meeting for all the C.A.V.E. administrators...",
  ["2206106_2"]="Looks like I have a meeting to attend.",
  ["2206106_3"]="Was Anchirp talking about this important meeting when it said \"mandatory\"?",
  ["2206106_4"]="(I put away the notice.)",
  ["2206107_1"]="Daily tasks and memos for the director of Eme-an...",
  ["2206107_2"]="This must be what Anchirp meant by \"daily duty,\" right?",
  ["2206107_3"]="As I glance at the never-ending list of tasks, exhaustion washes over me.",
  ["2206107_4"]="Did Anchirp bring me here just to remind me of the overwhelming workload waiting for me?",
  ["2206107_5"]="Is that bird secretly a capitalist or something?!",
  ["2206107_6"]="(I put away the list.)",
  ["2206108_1"]="Core commands for the Tower of Babel Database...",
  ["2206108_2"]="Why is such a crucial document left lying around?!",
  ["2206108_3"]="But could it be that Anchirp called me here to bring my attention to this important command set?",
  ["2206108_4"]="(I put away the command set.)",
  ["2206109_1"]="Anchirp stops on a book and quickly flips through it. Seems like this book is a story about saving someone by running.",
  ["2206109_10"]="Anchirp flies off. I should keep following it.",
  ["2206109_2"]="Any decision you make anytime, anywhere, will bring unpredictable impacts on your life.",
  ["2206109_3"]="Chirp, do you get it now?",
  ["2206109_4"]="Anchirp tilts its head, staring at me. Honestly, I still don't get what it means. I need more information.",
  ["2206109_5"]="Yeah... decisions matter, right?",
  ["2206109_6"]="Someone is waiting for me to save them, maybe?",
  ["2206109_7"]="What else have you learned?",
  ["2206109_8"]="Am I supposed to learn anything else?",
  ["2206109_9"]="Chirp! Of course you are!",
  ["2206110_1"]="You've got me wrong, mate! What I'm asking is: what are we truly living for? There has to be a goal, right?",
  ["2206110_2"]="Chirp, do you get it now?",
  ["2206110_3"]="Goals are important!",
  ["2206110_4"]="Chirp! And now my goal is...!",
  ["2206110_5"]="Anchirp pecks me hard before taking off. I should keep following it.",
  ["2206111_1"]="Why are we still suffering pain?",
  ["2206111_2"]="Chirp, do you get it now?",
  ["2206111_3"]="No more pecking on my head.",
  ["2206111_4"]="I've been suffering from the pain you've caused me.",
  ["2206111_5"]="Ouch, that hurts.",
  ["2206111_6"]="Stop your nefarious behavior now.",
  ["2206111_7"]="Chirp chirp!",
  ["2206111_8"]="Anchirp flies away angrily. I better follow to see what is going on.",
  ["2206112_1"]="Anchirp is pointing in that direction. I should follow and find out what it means.",
  ["2206113_1"]="What's this? A notice for a meeting for all the C.A.V.E. administrators???",
  ["2206113_2"]="What's the point of such an insignificant meeting? Are you seriously expecting me to attend the meeting on your behalf? I mean, come on! Asking a cute bird to attend a meeting for you?!",
  ["2206113_3"]="How about I just peck your head open and find out who came up with this ridiculous idea? Yeah, your head!",
  ["2206114_1"]="What's this? Daily tasks and memos for the director of Eme-an???",
  ["2206114_2"]="You, do your own work! Why are you giving me this list? Are you trying to make me do YOUR work?!",
  ["2206114_3"]="This is outrageous! I can't believe someone would order a cute bird to do their work! Where did this brutal taskmaster come from?!",
  ["2206115_1"]="Chirp? Core commanders for the Tower of Babel Database?",
  ["2206115_2"]="...",
  ["2206115_3"]="Why would you carry around such an important file, let alone give it to me?",
  ["2206115_4"]="Or is this... a conspiracy? Blaming an innocent and helpless bird for losing the command set?!",
  ["2206116_1"]="I just don't get it.",
  ["2206116_10"]="Hah! This type of attack has no effect on me whatsoever!",
  ["2206116_11"]="Tsk.",
  ["2206116_12"]="Can't you just clearly say what I'm supposed to do?",
  ["2206116_13"]="You're the almighty time machine, the backbone of Eme-an, and the new Head Librarian of the Library of Babel!",
  ["2206116_14"]="Reading a little bird's mind is a just walk in the park for you, isn't it?",
  ["2206116_15"]="It blinks its little eyes.",
  ["2206116_16"]="R-really?",
  ["2206116_17"]="I... I don't think so...",
  ["2206116_18"]="Yeah, right! Anyway...",
  ["2206116_19"]="Chirp! Chirp! Something important!",
  ["2206116_2"]="How can you not get it? Think of the bond between us! Are you denying our unspoken connection?!",
  ["2206116_20"]="Chirp! Value!",
  ["2206116_21"]="Chirp! Meaning!",
  ["2206116_22"]="Chirp! Directions!",
  ["2206116_23"]="Chirp! Your goals!",
  ["2206116_24"]="Anchirp grows more and more anxious before flying away abruptly.",
  ["2206116_3"]="We don't have anything like that.",
  ["2206116_4"]="No! I don't believe it!",
  ["2206116_5"]="(Look away sheepishly.)",
  ["2206116_6"]="(Fight back.)",
  ["2206116_7"]="Why are you looking away?!",
  ["2206116_8"]="With my intense pinching, Anchirp vanishes instantly.",
  ["2206116_9"]="The next moment, it reappears with renewed vigor.",
  ["2207101_1"]="Around World Calendar 2500 B.C., in our quest for the commands to control Aten, we came across another delirious soldier from the Immortal Army.",
  ["2207101_10"]="I'm not really into finding people, but this Captain Fairouz might have some authority and could give us useful information.",
  ["2207101_11"]="Continuing this way will lead us into the Unknown Sector.",
  ["2207101_12"]="Tsk, the Unknown Sector...",
  ["2207101_13"]="We've come this far already.",
  ["2207101_14"]="You're surprisingly calm about it.",
  ["2207101_2"]="May the glory of His Majesty light the way...",
  ["2207101_3"]="Your Majesty... please forgive us. We are devoted to you...",
  ["2207101_4"]="Please, show some mercy to... Captain Fairouz...",
  ["2207101_5"]="Captain... where are you...? Why won't you answer my call?",
  ["2207101_6"]="He's too delirious to make sense of anything.",
  ["2207101_7"]="Among his muttering, only the name \"Captain Fairouz\" seems to hold meaning. Perhaps he wants us to help find this Captain Fairouz?",
  ["2207101_8"]="We don't have enough information.",
  ["2207101_9"]="Hmph, all we know is this Captain Fairouz...",
  ["2207102_1"]="May the glory of His Majesty bless our existence...",
  ["2207102_10"]="He's hungry?",
  ["2207102_11"]="For ordinary people, hunger exacerbates their mental exhaustion within the Library.",
  ["2207102_12"]="In other words, let's get him something to eat.",
  ["2207102_13"]="Hopefully, feeding him will help him regain his senses.",
  ["2207102_14"]="Ere...",
  ["2207102_15"]="You're such a kind soul.",
  ["2207102_16"]="No, you shut up.",
  ["2207102_17"]="I just don't want this trip to be a waste.",
  ["2207102_2"]="Your Majesty... please forgive us. We are devoted to you...",
  ["2207102_3"]="May... His Majesty... grant us strength to fight till our last breath...",
  ["2207102_4"]="Nope, this guy is a lost cause, too.",
  ["2207102_5"]="Grrrr...",
  ["2207102_6"]="Wait, is that...?",
  ["2207102_7"]="It's his stomach growling.",
  ["2207102_8"]="Could it be that...",
  ["2207102_9"]="Grrrr...",
  ["2207103_1"]="Hmm? Is this a bread fermenter?",
  ["2207103_2"]="The bread inside is edible.",
  ["2207103_3"]="Take it to him. It should be enough.",
  ["2207104_1"]="Your Majesty...",
  ["2207104_10"]="Huh?",
  ["2207104_11"]="Aren't you awake now that you're full?",
  ["2207104_12"]="Open your eyes and look closely. Your so-called master isn't here.",
  ["2207104_13"]="You...",
  ["2207104_14"]="Surprise flickers across his face as if he just noticed our presence.",
  ["2207104_15"]="Eme-an? Did His Majesty send you to save me? His Majesty has once again showered me with his kindness and generosity...",
  ["2207104_16"]="Shut up.",
  ["2207104_17"]="We're not taking orders from Darius.",
  ["2207104_18"]="And we're the ones who found this bread.",
  ["2207104_19"]="This soldier has finally grasped the situation.",
  ["2207104_2"]="You... Ah, this... this is...",
  ["2207104_20"]="I see. So, His Majesty didn't order you to save me, but you did it out of kindness.",
  ["2207104_21"]="Even so, His Majesty's honor and grace won't be diminished.",
  ["2207104_22"]="Heh, if it wasn't for the so-called \"King of All Kings\" barging into the library with his troops, would you be starving here?",
  ["2207104_23"]="I'm following His Majesty willingly.",
  ["2207104_24"]="Forget it. Arguing with someone like him won't get us anywhere. Zero...",
  ["2207104_25"]="We're looking for an Immortal Army captain named Fairouz.",
  ["2207104_26"]="Ah, that's me.",
  ["2207104_27"]="Well, that saves us some trouble.",
  ["2207104_28"]="(Explain the soldier's situation to Fairouz.)",
  ["2207104_29"]="I see...",
  ["2207104_3"]="He snatches the jar, grabs the bread, and starts gobbling it down.",
  ["2207104_30"]="It's been a while since I left. He must be worried about me.",
  ["2207104_31"]="But unfortunately, I can't go back right now.",
  ["2207104_32"]="Eme-an, I can see clearly that you and your partners are different from the other Eme-ans we encountered in the Library.",
  ["2207104_33"]="Since you were kind enough to lend me a helping hand before, perhaps you could help me once again?",
  ["2207104_34"]="Of course, I'll make it worth your while.",
  ["2207104_35"]="Shoot it.",
  ["2207104_36"]="Please tell that soldier I can't go back now, as there are more pressing matters I must attend to.",
  ["2207104_37"]="This is all for His Majesty.",
  ["2207104_38"]="May the glory of His Majesty light the way!",
  ["2207104_4"]="He keeps eating until there's almost no bread left. Then he lets out a satisfied breath.",
  ["2207104_5"]="He licks his lips and wipes away the crumbs. His gaze is no longer vacant, and he seems much more refreshed.",
  ["2207104_6"]="May the glory of His Majesty bless our existence!",
  ["2207104_7"]="I thank His Majesty for granting me the food!",
  ["2207104_8"]="He reverently bows his head, half-kneeling and saluting towards nothingness in front of him.",
  ["2207104_9"]="Although his voice is still weak, his demeanor is completely different from the trance-like state he was in earlier.",
  ["2207105_1"]="May the glory of His Majesty light the way.",
  ["2207105_2"]="Seriously, what kind of nonsense is that?",
  ["2207105_3"]="Similar words are inscribed here too.",
  ["2207105_4"]="Glory... light the way...",
  ["2207105_5"]="Could it be that the torches indicate the correct path?",
  ["2207105_6"]="If these torches were left by the people who entered the Unknown Sector before us, following them might lead us to the people we're looking for.",
  ["2207105_7"]="Well, at least we have another clue. Let's go.",
  ["2207105_8"]="Remember, <color=#fec66b>follow the path indicated by the torches</color>.",
  ["2207106_1"]="Captain Fairouz leaves.",
  ["2207106_10"]="Everything that's started must be ended.",
  ["2207106_11"]="Ahem, we've come this far already.",
  ["2207106_12"]="I hope you'll stay positive.",
  ["2207106_2"]="What now?",
  ["2207106_3"]="Should we go back to that soldier?",
  ["2207106_4"]="It's your call.",
  ["2207106_5"]="Let's just forget it.",
  ["2207106_6"]="We've come this far already.",
  ["2207106_7"]="I hope you'll stay positive.",
  ["2207106_8"]="Before giving your answer, may I ask who agreed to this thankless task in the first place?",
  ["2207106_9"]="Oh, someone is giving up already, huh?",
  ["2208101_1"]="Around World Calendar 2500 B.C., in our quest for the commands to control Aten, we came across another delirious soldier from the Immortal Army.",
  ["2208101_2"]="After locating the \"Captain Fairouz\" he had mentioned, we returned to the spot where we initially encountered him at Captain Fairouz's request.",
  ["2208101_3"]="Where could he be?",
  ["2208101_4"]="Can he even move in his condition?",
  ["2208101_5"]="He's physically and emotionally exhausted.",
  ["2208101_6"]="Even if he did leave, he couldn't have gone too far.",
  ["2208101_7"]="Let's hope so.",
  ["2208101_8"]="Let's search around here.",
  ["2208102_1"]="Did you hear that?",
  ["2208102_2"]="It's faint, but I think it's a human voice.",
  ["2208102_3"]="Sounds like that soldier's voice.",
  ["2208102_4"]="So, he did come this way?",
  ["2208102_5"]="Something feels off.",
  ["2208102_6"]="...",
  ["2208102_7"]="But we don't have any other choice now.",
  ["2208102_8"]="When you hear that voice again... <color=#fec66b>if it gets clearer, it means we're getting closer to him.</color>",
  ["2208103_1"]="Is this a gallows? What's something like this doing in the Library?",
  ["2208103_2"]="Since when did those pedants start researching torture devices?",
  ["2208103_3"]="This is the work of the Immortal Army's execution squad.",
  ["2208103_4"]="They even came up with this brutal contraption, and they claim Darius is a wise ruler?",
  ["2208103_5"]="Their blind loyalty sickens me.",
  ["2208103_6"]="Anyway, we're not from this era, and we don't really understand their ways.",
  ["2208103_7"]="So, what now?",
  ["2208103_8"]="We've reached the end.",
  ["2208104_1"]="Ah... it's you...",
  ["2208104_10"]="I'm asking for your help, but I can't repay your kindness. It tarnishes the Immortal Army's honor, but please, have mercy on a man who's nearing his end.",
  ["2208104_11"]="Just shoot it.",
  ["2208104_12"]="Please go to Captain Fairouz and tell him not to come back.",
  ["2208104_13"]="His Majesty has lost patience, and he has ordered this gallows to be prepared for Captain Fairouz.",
  ["2208104_14"]="If he returns alive, he'll face His Majesty's death sentence.",
  ["2208104_15"]="...",
  ["2208104_16"]="The Immortal Army would never defy His Majesty's orders, so I stayed here, not daring to leave.",
  ["2208104_17"]="But the captain has always been kind and taken care of me. I can't turn a blind eye to his impending doom.",
  ["2208104_18"]="His Majesty is so high and mighty that he doesn't care about the disasters his orders bring upon us. I beg you. Please, inform Captain Fairouz about this...",
  ["2208104_19"]="...",
  ["2208104_2"]="I thought you were monsters... or maybe I've turned into a monster myself...",
  ["2208104_20"]="...",
  ["2208104_21"]="...",
  ["2208104_22"]="The soldier falls silent.",
  ["2208104_23"]="...",
  ["2208104_24"]="Let's go.",
  ["2208104_25"]="Looks like we'll have to go back again.",
  ["2208104_26"]="Let's deliver his message to Captain Fairouz.",
  ["2208104_3"]="I don't know... I'm sorry... I don't know what's happening to me...",
  ["2208104_4"]="I can't feel the ground beneath my feet or hold my weapon properly. Even my eyesight is failing me...",
  ["2208104_5"]="(Explain about Fairouz to the soldier.)",
  ["2208104_6"]="Oh, now I remember... I was hoping someone would help me find Captain Fairouz...",
  ["2208104_7"]="I completely forgot about it, but thank you for reminding me.",
  ["2208104_8"]="It's a relief to know he's still alive.",
  ["2208104_9"]="Could you do me another favor, Eme-an?",
  ["2208105_1"]="<color=#fec66b>Remember, follow the voice.</color>",
  ["2209101_1"]="To fulfill the final wish of the unnamed Immortal Army soldier, we found Captain Fairouz.",
  ["2209101_10"]="It's true that I've been kind to him, and he's already repaid it with his final words.",
  ["2209101_11"]="What's your plan now?",
  ["2209101_12"]="Captain Fairouz takes out a sheet of papyrus from his pocket.",
  ["2209101_13"]="Actually, I received this divine revelation a while ago.",
  ["2209101_14"]="What's this?",
  ["2209101_15"]="His Majesty has sought the secret to immortality from many scholars, and this is a list of the materials needed.",
  ["2209101_16"]="If I gather all the materials and present them to His Majesty, he will spare me from punishment and reward my loyalty.",
  ["2209101_17"]="Have you collected them all?",
  ["2209101_18"]="I've been searching for the materials since before you arrived, but...",
  ["2209101_19"]="But what?",
  ["2209101_2"]="Hmm? It's you? Didn't you go back?",
  ["2209101_20"]="Well, it's a bit awkward to ask, but I was hoping you could help me once more.",
  ["2209101_21"]="I need help in retrieving the materials on this list.",
  ["2209101_22"]="I was close to collecting everything, but I got ambushed on my way back.",
  ["2209101_23"]="I managed to escape but had to leave behind all the painstakingly gathered materials.",
  ["2209101_24"]="I tried collecting them again from other places, but luck wasn't on my side this time...",
  ["2209101_25"]="The deadline is approaching. I can't afford any more delays. So, I'm asking for your help in recovering my lost items.",
  ["2209101_26"]="Let's finish what we started.",
  ["2209101_27"]="I don't think that's a wise choice.",
  ["2209101_28"]="Ah, forget it. Just give us the list.",
  ["2209101_3"]="The soldier is dead.",
  ["2209101_4"]="He had a message for you before he died.",
  ["2209101_5"]="Don't go back because your king will sentence you to death.",
  ["2209101_6"]="...",
  ["2209101_7"]="...",
  ["2209101_8"]="So... he is...",
  ["2209101_9"]="Thank you for delivering the message.",
  ["2209102_1"]="Let's check the list... \"Mortal shells fade, brass bones endure.\"",
  ["2209102_2"]="Wait, a poem? That captain doesn't strike me as the poetic type.",
  ["2209102_3"]="Perhaps it was written by someone in Darius' court.",
  ["2209102_4"]="But how are we supposed to find the materials mentioned in this riddle-like poem?",
  ["2209102_5"]="The hint seems quite obvious: brass.",
  ["2209102_6"]="Tsk, your know-it-all expression is as annoying as ever.",
  ["2209102_7"]="Wait, is this vase made of... brass?",
  ["2209102_8"]="Well, there's one item down. This must be what the captain left behind.",
  ["2209103_1"]="Let's take another look at the list.",
  ["2209103_2"]="White bones shatter, jade's spine holds firm.",
  ["2209103_3"]="Seems like the captain was collecting things like jade. These agates must be what he found earlier, too.",
  ["2209103_4"]="What does the word \"spine\" mean? Could it be like a human spine?",
  ["2209104_1"]="What a disappointment. It's just some mercury, nothing special.",
  ["2209104_2"]="Mercury is also on the list.",
  ["2209104_3"]="Yeah, yeah, Ms. Know-It-All. I saw that too. \"Flesh heart perishes, mercury flows as true blood.\"",
  ["2209104_4"]="What on earth is Darius intending to do?",
  ["2209105_1"]="This dining set looks exquisite. It appears to be made of sterling silver.",
  ["2209105_2"]="If the captain is willing to offer this to Darius, I must admire his dedication.",
  ["2209105_3"]="The next line on the list... \"Silver wards off poison, consuming it quells hunger.\"",
  ["2209105_4"]="Wait, what? Is Darius seriously planning to eat off a silver plate?",
  ["2209106_1"]="We've found all the items on the list.",
  ["2209106_2"]="Then let's head back.",
  ["2209106_3"]="Let's hope he's still waiting for us.",
  ["2209107_1"]="You're back, at last!",
  ["2209107_10"]="Since His Majesty needs these materials for immortality, the Immortal Army will find everything for him.",
  ["2209107_11"]="Aren't you afraid that the technique won't work and your king will blame you?",
  ["2209107_12"]="If that happens, I'm prepared to face the consequences.",
  ["2209107_13"]="But I have faith that His Majesty would never take his anger out on his loyal soldiers.",
  ["2209107_14"]="Eme-an, even though we may not be on the same path, you've been incredibly helpful to me a couple of times...",
  ["2209107_15"]="I promised to make it worth your while, and I intend to keep that promise.",
  ["2209107_16"]="How about we meeting here again in a month?",
  ["2209107_17"]="By then, I'll prove His Majesty's benevolence and show my gratitude with some heartfelt gifts!",
  ["2209107_18"]="I don't know where your confidence comes from.",
  ["2209107_19"]="But for us, \"meeting here again in a month\" is just a piece of cake.",
  ["2209107_2"]="How did it go? Did you find the items?",
  ["2209107_20"]="We'll see you then and witness the so-called benevolence of your king.",
  ["2209107_21"]="Sure.",
  ["2209107_22"]="Eme-an, thank you again for everything you've done for me.",
  ["2209107_23"]="I'll speak highly of you to His Majesty, and once he hears about your contributions, he'll surely reward you, too.",
  ["2209107_24"]="Now, I need to hurry back and present these materials to His Majesty. See you in a month!",
  ["2209107_3"]="We have everything here.",
  ["2209107_4"]="Thank you all so much!",
  ["2209107_5"]="However...",
  ["2209107_6"]="What's wrong?",
  ["2209107_7"]="What do all these things have to do with immortality?",
  ["2209107_8"]="I'm just a soldier, not a scholar.",
  ["2209107_9"]="I find what His Majesty wants and never question why.",
  ["2209108_1"]="He is...",
  ["2209108_2"]="...dead?",
  ["2209108_3"]="...",
  ["2209108_4"]="Mercury, brass, agate, and sterling silver.",
  ["2209108_5"]="Those are the materials on the list.",
  ["2209108_6"]="They were used in experiments intending for immortality... and implanted into human bodies.",
  ["2209108_7"]="It's insane, both this era and its emperor.",
  ["2209109_1"]="What are you waiting for?",
  ["2209109_2"]="Take us to one month later. I want to see what Fairouz has to say.",
  ["2209109_3"]="(We fast forward to one month later.)",
  ["2209110_1"]="Fairouz seems to have broken his promise to return.",
  ["2209110_2"]="Where is that guy?",
  ["2209110_3"]="Didn't he say he'd meet us here in a month?",
  ["2209110_4"]="Let's look around for him, alright?",
  ["2209110_5"]="Tsk, what a hassle.",
  ["2209111_1"]="What are you doing?",
  ["2209111_2"]="Read the instructions before you operate it, will you?",
  ["2209111_3"]="The Memphis text on this drawing holds the key to activating this device.",
  ["2209111_4"]="<color=#fec66b>\"Amidst fiery baptism, the rising unfolds... as the torrential river crashes, plague behold...\"</color>",
  ["2210101_1"]="Around World Calendar 2500 B.C., in our quest for the commands to control Aten, we encountered the ancient Eme-an we had previously met once more.",
  ["2210101_10"]="They were completely focused on searching for specific items and seemed oblivious to everything else.",
  ["2210101_11"]="Even I, an ordinary man with no special training, managed to follow them unnoticed for quite a while.",
  ["2210101_12"]="You've got some guts.",
  ["2210101_13"]="I observed them carefully before taking such risks.",
  ["2210101_14"]="Besides, I had to pass through that area to find my companions.",
  ["2210101_15"]="Through my observations, I learned the purpose of their mission.",
  ["2210101_16"]="I believe they're the logistics squad responsible for transporting a valuable trophy. They entered the tower to report back to Rubicon.",
  ["2210101_17"]="Now they're in trouble. Rubicon is nowhere to be found, and even the trophy they were protecting is missing.",
  ["2210101_18"]="The trophy is related to the war between Japheth and the Peace Empire, and I can't do anything about it. That's why I'm asking for your help.",
  ["2210101_19"]="What is it?",
  ["2210101_2"]="Eme-an from the future, I never thought we'd meet again.",
  ["2210101_20"]="Help me retrieve the lost trophy.",
  ["2210101_21"]="They started a war and devastated the Library, and now you're asking us to find their trophy out of kindness?",
  ["2210101_22"]="No, not out of kindness. Considering that Japheth soldiers dispatched a whole squad to guard it, the trophy must be valuable enough to be considered the treasure of the Peace Empire.",
  ["2210101_23"]="While the Library is in chaos during this era, we need to find a safe place for those treasures.",
  ["2210101_24"]="Sure, I'll help you.",
  ["2210101_25"]="What should we do?",
  ["2210101_26"]="That's great to hear.",
  ["2210101_27"]="I've been observing for a while, and that path will lead you to those Japheth soldiers.",
  ["2210101_28"]="Once you find them, you can tail them and gather more information.",
  ["2210101_29"]="However, please be careful. I'm asking for your help, but I don't want you to get hurt.",
  ["2210101_3"]="Do you remember what I mentioned earlier? That Rubicon brought his army into the Tower of Babel?",
  ["2210101_30"]="A useful clue, a good starting point.",
  ["2210101_4"]="And you've found their trail?",
  ["2210101_5"]="Yes and no.",
  ["2210101_6"]="I did spot a Japheth army while searching for my companions.",
  ["2210101_7"]="But they were clearly different from Rubicon's guards, both in their vigilance and their purpose... entering the Tower of Babel.",
  ["2210101_8"]="Their vigilance?",
  ["2210101_9"]="Their purpose?",
  ["2210201_1"]="Who's there?!",
  ["2210201_2"]="I remain silent.",
  ["2210201_3"]="(Create a distraction.)",
  ["2210201_4"]="Am I hearing things?",
  ["2210201_5"]="Weird...",
  ["2210201_6"]="Everything about this place is so weird!",
  ["2210201_7"]="Stay alert. Proceed with caution.",
  ["2210201_8"]="Yes, Captain!",
  ["2210202_1"]="Hey, they're getting too far ahead. We've lost them!",
  ["2210301_1"]="What's this?",
  ["2210301_2"]="Thurinus silver coins.",
  ["2210301_3"]="Did the Japheth soldiers bring them here?",
  ["2210301_4"]="It's hard to say for sure.",
  ["2210301_5"]="Why is that?",
  ["2210301_6"]="Because Thurinus silver coins are in circulation in various regions in this era, including Obed.",
  ["2210301_7"]="Even on the other side of the continent, the people in Obed were using Japheth's currency. It really shows who held the true power back then.",
  ["2210302_1"]="Your Highness Rubicon... We are so sorry...",
  ["2210302_2"]="Hey, hey... Tsk...",
  ["2210302_3"]="The labyrinth... trophy... retrieve... His Highness...",
  ["2210302_4"]="He must one of the Japheth soldiers who lost the trophy.",
  ["2210302_5"]="Judging from the tragic situation, their squad has been almost wiped out.",
  ["2210302_6"]="He mentioned \"retrieve.\" Could it be that they've already found the trophy in this area, and that's why they're guarding here?",
  ["2210303_1"]="...",
  ["2210303_2"]="What's so special about this chair?",
  ["2210303_3"]="I believe this is their lost trophy.",
  ["2210303_4"]="Rumor has it that the emperor of the Peace Kingdom presented this chair to Japheth as a peace offering.",
  ["2210303_5"]="Turns out it's just a shabby chair. How ridiculous! He actually gave up his throne for a chance at negotiations.",
  ["2210304_1"]="The Annals of Babel, written by Eme-an. It's an annual gift given to the emperor of Obed.",
  ["2210304_2"]="It analyzes the world's situation at the time and provides advice on governing the empire.",
  ["2210304_3"]="However, it seems that our tradition didn't impress the emperor of Obed in this era.",
  ["2210304_4"]="This book is completely untouched, and its title... Pfft...",
  ["2210304_5"]="Be cautious of Japheth... It's quite ridiculous that Eme-an already warned the emperor, but unfortunately, he never seemed to listen to others' opinions.",
  ["2210305_1"]="Great, you're back in one piece!",
  ["2210305_10"]="Will you return it to the Japheth soldiers?",
  ["2210305_11"]="All the Japheth soldiers who were protecting the trophy were killed in the Library.",
  ["2210305_12"]="In fact, their expedition to the Peace Empire was never about the throne. They already obtained the bronze sphere they were after, and now their sole focus is the Tower of Babel. Nothing else matters to them.",
  ["2210305_13"]="Are you intending to return it to the Peace Empire?",
  ["2210305_14"]="Do you think that empire will even last?",
  ["2210305_15"]="...",
  ["2210305_16"]="Well, I already know the answer, Eme-an from the future.",
  ["2210305_17"]="Even Eme-an in this era have come to the same conclusion. The moment the fifth emperor relinquished his throne, he lost the right to reclaim it.",
  ["2210305_18"]="So, what do we do now?",
  ["2210305_19"]="I asked you to find the trophy but not with the intention of returning it to the Japheth soldiers or the Peace Empire.",
  ["2210305_2"]="We've found the trophy, but...",
  ["2210305_20"]="I hope you'll accept the throne and store it in a proper place, as a testament to this chaotic chapter of history.",
  ["2210305_21"]="In that case, I'll accept it.",
  ["2210305_22"]="Then we'll go our separate ways.",
  ["2210305_23"]="May the Library be with you, Eme-an from the future.",
  ["2210305_3"]="It's just a chair.",
  ["2210305_4"]="I see.",
  ["2210305_5"]="You don't seem surprised.",
  ["2210305_6"]="Well, considering the fact that the fifth emperor of the Peace Empire offered the throne as a peace gesture...",
  ["2210305_7"]="It's not surprising at all.",
  ["2210305_8"]="After all, it's something he would have done.",
  ["2210305_9"]="So, what do you plan to do with this trophy?",
  ["2210306_1"]="Shouldn't we follow them?",
  ["2210306_2"]="Haven't you noticed how alert these soldiers are?",
  ["2210306_3"]="They don't match the description given by that Eme-an, but he wasn't lying either.",
  ["2210306_4"]="So, they're not the Japheth soldiers who lost their trophy?",
  ["2210306_5"]="Indeed.",
  ["2210306_6"]="Since they're not our targets, there's no point in following them. Besides...",
  ["2210306_7"]="This crossroads provides us with another insight.",
  ["2210306_8"]="Just imagine a squad of Japheth soldiers who can't find their commander and have lost their trophy, panicking and unaware that they're being followed.",
  ["2210306_9"]="You won't believe how messy the tracks were that they left behind in that crazy situation.",
  ["2210307_1"]="As Ereshan gestures to the other side of the crossroads, you notice a disturbance on the ground, a mess of footprints and marks made by weapons.",
  ["2210307_2"]="Let's take the other path then.",
  ["2212101_1"]="Some day after I became the Head Librarian of Eme-an, I heard about a missing collectible from the archives. Perhaps Nanna has the details.",
  ["2212101_10"]="Well, not likely.",
  ["2212101_11"]="Why is that?",
  ["2212101_12"]="If someone wants to borrow something from the archive, they have to go through all the paperwork.",
  ["2212101_13"]="I checked the records, and the Hubble Telescope has never been borrowed in its 350-year history.",
  ["2212101_14"]="Of course, that's just my initial conclusion based on the information I have. We don't have solid evidence yet.",
  ["2212101_15"]="Oh, and after the Hubble Telescope was stolen, there was this weird phenomenon in the Library.",
  ["2212101_16"]="What phenomenon?",
  ["2212101_17"]="Wind.",
  ["2212101_18"]="Wind?",
  ["2212101_19"]="Yeah, wind started blowing consistently in certain areas of the Known Sector.",
  ["2212101_2"]="(Ask Nanna about the situation.)",
  ["2212101_20"]="It's not strange on its own, but when it happens in multiple sectors and blows in the same direction, it's suspicious.",
  ["2212101_21"]="What's causing this wind? Is it natural or something artificial? And does it have any connection to the theft of the Hubble Telescope?",
  ["2212101_22"]="We have so many questions but very few clues to work with.",
  ["2212101_23"]="Let's investigate the wind. Take Ere and Zero and <color=#fec66b>follow the direction the wind is coming from</color>. See if you can find any more clues.",
  ["2212101_24"]="I'll examine the scene and see if I can find anything else.",
  ["2212101_3"]="The missing item is called the Hubble Telescope.",
  ["2212101_4"]="We found some weird scuff marks in the archive room.",
  ["2212101_5"]="But there wasn't any other damage or signs of things being moved or knocked over.",
  ["2212101_6"]="The thief knew their way around the archive room or at least knew where the Hubble Telescope was kept. They probably targeted it specifically.",
  ["2212101_7"]="But of course, we can't rule out the possibility that the Hubble Telescope was stolen because it was placed near the entrance.",
  ["2212101_8"]="We noticed it was missing pretty quickly since it was so prominently displayed.",
  ["2212101_9"]="Maybe someone borrowed it?",
  ["2212102_1"]="Are you feeling it?",
  ["2212102_2"]="No.",
  ["2212102_3"]="Yeah, I'm feeling a wind.",
  ["2212102_4"]="Tsk, I knew better than to count on you, Zero.",
  ["2212102_5"]="I can clearly feel the \"wind\" Nanna was talking about.",
  ["2212105_1"]="What's wrong with this guy?",
  ["2212105_10"]="What will happen?",
  ["2212105_11"]="I'm not sure. We don't know how that machine works yet.",
  ["2212105_12"]="But let's say that there's a never-ending exhaust fan running in the Library, and its wind power keeps increasing.",
  ["2212105_13"]="Eventually, it will become too powerful and wreck the whole sector.",
  ["2212105_14"]="But that's just a theory, right?",
  ["2212105_15"]="Yeah, it's just a theory, but the fate of the entire Library of Babel is on the line. Do you really want to take chances?",
  ["2212105_16"]="Let's shut it down quickly!",
  ["2212105_17"]="Yeah, we need to shut it down to get to the Hubble Telescope.",
  ["2212105_18"]="Let's <color=#fec66b>get rid of this guy</color>.",
  ["2212105_2"]="It's not attacking us.",
  ["2212105_3"]="But it's blocking our path.",
  ["2212105_4"]="All the air is getting sucked into that machine's air intake. That must be the switch for the air intake, right? Is it trying to stop us from reaching it?",
  ["2212105_5"]="Behind the air intake is the Hubble Telescope.",
  ["2212105_6"]="Do you have a feeling that...?",
  ["2212105_7"]="Is the wind getting stronger?",
  ["2212105_8"]="...",
  ["2212105_9"]="Yeah, the wind is definitely picking up. If we don't stop it soon...",
  ["2212107_1"]="What the heck? It's not even fighting back?",
  ["2212107_2"]="It's not attacking us, but we can't destroy it either.",
  ["2212107_3"]="Why does it have to be in our way?",
  ["2212107_4"]="What just fell from it?",
  ["2212108_1"]="What's this?",
  ["2212108_10"]="Yeah, it could be.",
  ["2212108_11"]="Then let's go look for information about this Cassegrain. We can't do much while this monster blocks our way.",
  ["2212108_2"]="Even in its terrible condition, I can tell it's an Eme-an librarian's manual, although the material and style are different.",
  ["2212108_3"]="Can you make out what's written on it?",
  ["2212108_4"]="Hmm, I can barely make out a name, <color=#fec66b>Cassegrain</color>.",
  ["2212108_5"]="Is that this guy's name?",
  ["2212108_6"]="I'm not sure if the name belongs to the manual's keeper.",
  ["2212108_7"]="Each manual records the biography a librarian, but it might contain a number of different names in it.",
  ["2212108_8"]="A name alone doesn't tell us much about a person.",
  ["2212108_9"]="But Cassegrain could be a clue, right?",
  ["2212109_1"]="Let's just contact Nanna.",
  ["2212109_10"]="Did Cassegrain have any enemies who would go to such lengths to steal his invention?",
  ["2212109_11"]="It was more than three centuries ago, but if I recall correctly, Cassegrain was on good terms with almost everyone.",
  ["2212109_12"]="...",
  ["2212109_13"]="I suggest you look up Cassegrain's biography in the archive.",
  ["2212109_2"]="Hey, how's your investigation going?",
  ["2212109_3"]="Here's the situation...",
  ["2212109_4"]="So, you found a fragment of an Eme-an librarian's manual with the name \"Cassegrain\" on it?",
  ["2212109_5"]="Perhaps it belonged to a contemporary of Cassegrain.",
  ["2212109_6"]="Because Cassegrain was the 362nd director, and he didn't venture into the Path of No Return.",
  ["2212109_7"]="Moreover, I believe it's more than a mere coincidence, though I'm not entirely sure what's going on here.",
  ["2212109_8"]="Because the stolen item, the Hubble Telescope, was actually Cassegrain's final invention.",
  ["2212109_9"]="Looks like the thief targeted the Hubble Telescope right from the start.",
  ["2212110_1"]="Here is recorded Cassegrain's education and scientific pursuits.",
  ["2212110_2"]="School of engineering, optical design, and astronomy...",
  ["2212110_3"]="It makes sense for someone who invented the Hubble Telescope to study these subjects.",
  ["2212111_1"]="These records highlight the major inventions throughout Cassegrain's life.",
  ["2212111_2"]="Whether it was lens design or optical systems, all his inventions ultimately led to the creation of the Hubble Telescope.",
  ["2212111_3"]="He dedicated most of his life to its development.",
  ["2212112_1"]="At long last, I have completed my invention.",
  ["2212112_2"]="Unfortunately, my time is running out. I'm afraid I won't be able to see it put to use in my lifetime.",
  ["2212112_3"]="Well, I guess that can't be helped. Maybe I should engrave this on my tombstone...",
  ["2212112_4"]="Now there's only one question left: how can we drain the atmosphere above the telescope?",
  ["2212113_1"]="What does that mean?",
  ["2212113_10"]="...",
  ["2212113_11"]="...drain the atmosphere above the telescope.",
  ["2212113_12"]="It takes Cassegrain's epitaph seriously.",
  ["2212113_13"]="It stole the Hubble Telescope and placed it behind the exhaust fan.",
  ["2212113_14"]="It never attacks or fights back, but it will prevent anyone from approaching the machine...",
  ["2212113_15"]="So that the fan will drain all the air within the Library, or rather, in front of the telescope.",
  ["2212113_16"]="The power that fuels its actions stems from Cassegrain's epitaph.",
  ["2212113_17"]="Why would it go to such lengths?",
  ["2212113_18"]="We may never know.",
  ["2212113_19"]="In this Library, unwavering thoughts manifest in peculiar ways.",
  ["2212113_2"]="The Hubble Telescope was originally designed for use in space, where the absence of an atmosphere prevents observation errors.",
  ["2212113_20"]="Hmph, it's going to such lengths just because of a joke, right?",
  ["2212113_21"]="So, what should we do now?",
  ["2212113_22"]="Can we reason with it?",
  ["2212113_23"]="You know what? I think you're actually onto something.",
  ["2212113_24"]="The fact that it can memorize the epitaph and act upon its contents suggests a certain level of intelligence. Maybe we can actually reason with it.",
  ["2212113_25"]="Anyway, it's worth a try.",
  ["2212113_3"]="Cassegrain realized this and dedicated his life to creating a telescope suitable for a vacuum environment.",
  ["2212113_4"]="However, at the time of his invention, humans had no means to send it into space, so he left behind that joking epitaph.",
  ["2212113_5"]="His lifetime of research and invention was never actually used until after his death.",
  ["2212113_6"]="He had an optimistic mindset to engrave that joke on his tombstone.",
  ["2212113_7"]="While he might seem lighthearted, he couldn't actually let go at the end of his life.",
  ["2212113_8"]="What's with that expression? You don't seriously think Cassegrain intended to build an exhaust fan to drain the atmosphere, right?",
  ["2212113_9"]="No, not at all.",
  ["2212114_1"]="The nameless monster remains in place, guarding the machine and the telescope behind it.",
  ["2212114_10"]="...",
  ["2212114_11"]="...",
  ["2212114_12"]="After my explanation, there is a moment of silence, and then it starts to move.",
  ["2212114_13"]="It steps aside, no longer obstructing the path to the machine.",
  ["2212114_2"]="As I approach, the nameless monster stands motionless, completely unaware of me. But whenever I try to pass, it blocks my way.",
  ["2212114_3"]="Your persistence is pointless.",
  ["2212114_4"]="It remains unwavering.",
  ["2212114_5"]="That's not what Cassegrain meant.",
  ["2212114_6"]="I'm not sure if it understands, but when I mention the name \"Cassegrain,\" it reacts.",
  ["2212114_7"]="It seems to gaze down at me slightly.",
  ["2212114_8"]="(Explain the true meaning of Cassegrain's epitaph.)",
  ["2212114_9"]="...",
  ["2212115_1"]="Why did it...?",
  ["2212115_10"]="Many questions never have the chance to find their answers.",
  ["2212115_11"]="Ereshan's voice grows quieter and quieter until it dissolves into a sigh.",
  ["2212115_2"]="It realizes that what it's been doing is pointless.",
  ["2212115_3"]="You've opened its eyes to the truth.",
  ["2212115_4"]="Once the veil of obsession is lifted, the force that held it together loses its power.",
  ["2212115_5"]="What exactly is this thing, anyway?",
  ["2212115_6"]="What's its relationship with Cassegrain?",
  ["2212115_7"]="Cassegrain must hold great significance for it, right?",
  ["2212115_8"]="...",
  ["2212115_9"]="Well, who knows?",
  ["2213101_1"]="Around World Calendar 2000 B.C., in our quest for the commands to control Aten, we encountered an Eme-an Emian who was seeking help in gathering research data...",
  ["2213101_10"]="We were well aware that ten years wouldn't be nearly enough for our research, and we were prepared to invest more time and effort.",
  ["2213101_11"]="But Darius' patience wore thin.",
  ["2213101_12"]="When we failed to deliver what he wanted, he deemed our research worthless, claiming that we had squandered valuable time on meaningless pursuits.",
  ["2213101_13"]="So he led his army straight into the tower.",
  ["2213101_14"]="When faced with the Immortal Army's spears, our precious findings meant nothing to them.",
  ["2213101_15"]="We realized that the Immortal Army would destroy our research data beyond repair.",
  ["2213101_16"]="My companions only had the time to hastily hide the documents.",
  ["2213101_17"]="Later, some were taken by the Immortal Army, and others got separated while trying to escape.",
  ["2213101_18"]="Now, I'm the only one left here. I must pick up my pace and organize the research materials on the God of the Sun in Memphis.",
  ["2213101_19"]="Please, I'm counting on you.",
  ["2213101_2"]="Who might you be?",
  ["2213101_20"]="Lead the way.",
  ["2213101_3"]="We're Eme-ans from the future.",
  ["2213101_4"]="We've come to help gather research data.",
  ["2213101_5"]="The unfamiliar Eme-an observes us carefully for a moment as if thinking about something and finally shows a relieved expression.",
  ["2213101_6"]="I see.",
  ["2213101_7"]="Then let me fill you on what happened...",
  ["2213101_8"]="Ten years ago, Darius ordered us to study the God of the Sun in Memphis.",
  ["2213101_9"]="We spent ten years researching, but we never fully understood the nature of the God of the Sun.",
  ["2213102_1"]="Why is Aten here?",
  ["2213102_10"]="My companions in this workshop were primarily responsible for measurements and disassembly.",
  ["2213102_11"]="The measurements went smoothly, but when it came to disassembling, everyone hit a wall.",
  ["2213102_12"]="After all, it's a god's creation. No matter how hard we tried over the past ten years, we couldn't disassemble it.",
  ["2213102_13"]="I wish we could take this thing apart easily.",
  ["2213102_14"]="This replica was created using drawings provided by the replica team and measurements supplied by the measurement team. It was then crafted by the casting team.",
  ["2213102_15"]="On the outside, it looks almost identical to the real artifact, but the inside is nothing like the original.",
  ["2213102_16"]="Wait... disassembly... disassembly!",
  ["2213102_17"]="That's it! While the real artifact can't be disassembled, this replica can be.",
  ["2213102_18"]="They moved this replica from the casting group because they must have hidden the documents inside it.",
  ["2213102_2"]="Oh, this is just a replica we made for research purposes. Strange, it wasn't in this workshop before...",
  ["2213102_3"]="Where are the documents?",
  ["2213102_4"]="To be honest, the Immortal Army came without warning. I wasn't there when they invaded.",
  ["2213102_5"]="So, we're basically clueless?",
  ["2213102_6"]="Well, not completely.",
  ["2213102_7"]="My colleagues must have hoped that their documents would be safe from Darius and the Immortal Army and that future Eme-ans could retrieve them.",
  ["2213102_8"]="Based on our understanding of one another over the years, I believe each group hid their documents in a way related to their research methods.",
  ["2213102_9"]="There were five different groups working on the research.",
  ["2213103_1"]="You discover research notes within the remains of the replica of Aten.",
  ["2213103_2"]="The cover reads, \"Measurements completed.\"",
  ["2213103_3"]="The cover reads, \"Disassembly failed.\"",
  ["2213104_1"]="That's it.",
  ["2213104_2"]="Let's move on to the next workshop.",
  ["2213105_1"]="My companions in this workshop were responsible for duplicating parts.",
  ["2213105_2"]="Replicating a divine creation was no easy task.",
  ["2213105_3"]="All we managed to do was draw up blueprints. With those blueprints and the data we had, the casting team created this replica.",
  ["2213105_4"]="But this replica is only halfway finished.",
  ["2213105_5"]="I think we can try to restore it.",
  ["2213105_6"]="What should we do?",
  ["2213105_7"]="I've checked the bookshelves around here, and it's clear that they've been replaced. The materials needed to finish the replica are hidden within them.",
  ["2213105_8"]="Let's search those bookshelves!",
  ["2213106_1"]="After you restore the replica, the research note hidden underneath is revealed.",
  ["2213106_2"]="The cover reads, \"Replication failed.\"",
  ["2213106_3"]="The cover reads, \"Casting successful.\"",
  ["2213107_1"]="After the other groups shared their research findings, we formed the prayer group and started collecting all kinds of information about Memphis history, legends, texts, and other aspects.",
  ["2213107_2"]="We were trying to understand the nature of the God of the Sun from a linguistic perspective.",
  ["2213107_3"]="Even when Darius stormed into the tower, my companions were still working.",
  ["2213107_4"]="They probably didn't have enough time to hide the documents. I believe their research note should be hidden somewhere within the bookshelves. Can you find them for me?",
  ["2213108_1"]="The only thing they managed to do was to lock the bookshelf.",
  ["2213108_2"]="Unfortunately, I don't have the key, so please help me unlock it.",
  ["2213109_1"]="After unlocking the bookshelf, you find the research note hidden inside.",
  ["2213109_2"]="The cover reads, \"Prayer.\"",
  ["2213110_1"]="The man takes the notes and quickly flips through them. When he reaches the last page, he pauses briefly before closing the book.",
  ["2213110_10"]="The research notes we collected before, about measurements, disassembly, replication, casting, and prayer... they're only a part of our research.",
  ["2213110_11"]="You've spent ten years, after all.",
  ["2213110_12"]="Even though we haven't retrieved all the notes, the information we've gathered in such a short time is the essence of our research.",
  ["2213110_13"]="But still... if only I had more time...",
  ["2213110_14"]="There are still things I need to retrieve and organize.",
  ["2213110_15"]="Please take those documents away so that they won't be destroyed by Darius' wrath.",
  ["2213110_16"]="My comrades were devoted to their research until the very end. Naturally, I must stay here and resume their work.",
  ["2213110_17"]="...",
  ["2213110_18"]="Don't give me that look. With a little luck, I'll be able to continue my research, right?",
  ["2213110_19"]="As for the part you have in your hand, I've memorized most of it, and once things calm down, I should be able to reproduce the information from memory.",
  ["2213110_2"]="...",
  ["2213110_20"]="Well, as long as I have enough time, that is.",
  ["2213110_21"]="Farewell, Eme-an from the future. Please keep our documents safe.",
  ["2213110_22"]="I hope our research will never end.",
  ["2213110_3"]="Time is against us.",
  ["2213110_4"]="What phenomenon?",
  ["2213110_5"]="The other soldiers from the Immortal Army must have noticed the commotion here because their defeated comrades haven't returned to report yet.",
  ["2213110_6"]="We'll escort you out of here.",
  ["2213110_7"]="No, I must stay here.",
  ["2213110_8"]="What are you talking about? Are you out of your mind?",
  ["2213110_9"]="While you were helping me gather information, I already skimmed through the contents.",
  ["2213111_1"]="I didn't expect the Immortal Army to be so quick. Thankfully, the lock is still intact!",
  ["2213111_2"]="However, I don't have the key to the door. Please help me unlock it.",
  ["2213112_1"]="Great! This is one of our notes.",
  ["2213112_2"]="Let's move on to the next workshop.",
  ["2214101_1"]="Some day after I became the Head Librarian of Eme-an, Nanna reached out to me, stating she had a favor to ask.",
  ["2214101_10"]="This arithmetic unit is a bit different from what we've seen before. Please keep an eye out.",
  ["2214101_2"]="I'm sure you got my message.",
  ["2214101_3"]="An <color=#fec66b>algorithmic unit</color> appeared out of nowhere, and now it's rampaging through the Library.",
  ["2214101_4"]="Please get rid of it before it causes more damage.",
  ["2214101_5"]="Why do we have to deal with such trivial stuff?!",
  ["2214101_6"]="Fine.",
  ["2214101_7"]="...",
  ["2214101_8"]="...",
  ["2214101_9"]="Fine.",
  ["2214102_1"]="What's the situation on your end?",
  ["2214102_2"]="We're being held back by some annoying stuff.",
  ["2214102_3"]="That unusual algorithmic unit has stopped. I'm sending you its location. Go there directly.",
  ["2214102_4"]="Tsk.",
  ["2214102_5"]="...",
  ["2214103_1"]="Wait.",
  ["2214103_2"]="Wait? So it can run away?",
  ["2214103_3"]="No, it hasn't moved this time.",
  ["2214103_4"]="Yeah, you're right. Could it be reacting to our actions?",
  ["2214103_5"]="Don't let it run again because if it does, we'll never catch up to it.",
  ["2214103_6"]="<color=#fec66b>Activate the mechanism</color> and block the entrance and exit of this area.",
  ["2214104_1"]="Please, don't!",
  ["2214104_10"]="And it takes punches like one too.",
  ["2214104_11"]="Then it must be an arithmetic unit.",
  ["2214104_12"]="No, no! Not at all! It's actually a replica I created!",
  ["2214104_13"]="It is designed to look very similar to a real arithmetic unit. In a sense, replicas are a special type of the real thing.",
  ["2214104_14"]="So, it's a special type of algorithmic unit.",
  ["2214104_15"]="Thanks for acknowledging that.",
  ["2214104_16"]="Then let's just get rid of it.",
  ["2214104_17"]="Hold on! It's not what you think!",
  ["2214104_18"]="Its full name is <color=#fec66b>Faux Arithmetic Unit Multipurpose Pathfinder</color>!",
  ["2214104_19"]="...",
  ["2214104_2"]="Don't harm it!",
  ["2214104_20"]="...",
  ["2214104_21"]="Walking the Path of No Return is fascinating, but imagine the regret if we couldn't bring back the knowledge we gathered and share it with our fellow librarians! That's why I came up with this contraption.",
  ["2214104_22"]="It explores the Unknown Sector, maps the path, collects information, examines the surroundings, and brings back crucial data!",
  ["2214104_23"]="This way, we can start more in-depth research even before embarking on the Path of No Return!",
  ["2214104_24"]="So, it stayed there because it was gathering information about its surroundings?",
  ["2214104_25"]="Precisely!",
  ["2214104_26"]="In that case, why did you make it look like an algorithmic unit?",
  ["2214104_27"]="Well, the library is filled with all kinds of dangers. It's just a necessary defense mechanism to keep the machine functioning for as long as possible!",
  ["2214104_28"]="...",
  ["2214104_29"]="Plus, its mobility is a great asset! If it can't defeat something, it can always run away!",
  ["2214104_3"]="Huh?",
  ["2214104_30"]="...",
  ["2214104_31"]="Can you explain why it's causing chaos in the Known Sector of the Library?",
  ["2214104_32"]="Well, that's because of its energy supply system.",
  ["2214104_33"]="Considering its purpose and the environment, I linked its energy supply to the Library of Babel itself.",
  ["2214104_34"]="Although the anomaly can't provide it with an endless energy supply, as long as the Library of Babel exists, the power consumption for its movements within the Library is significantly reduced.",
  ["2214104_35"]="Once it enters the Library of Babel, it will continue sending back data within the signal range until it runs out of energy.",
  ["2214104_36"]="And even when it's outside the signal range, it will still move around and record data, which we can retrieve from its storage later.",
  ["2214104_37"]="However, during the time I was working on it, the Library of Babel was closed.",
  ["2214104_38"]="Since its energy supply system is linked to the Library itself, it wasn't able to be activated since its creation...",
  ["2214104_39"]="Until recently, when the Library of Babel was suddenly reopened, it started functioning again!",
  ["2214104_4"]="Huh?",
  ["2214104_40"]="But I never expected it to start running again, so I didn't fine-tune its parameters.",
  ["2214104_41"]="Ha... you know what happened next... it ended up rampaging through the Known Sector. Just a little accident, you know.",
  ["2214104_42"]="Did you hear all of that, Nanna?",
  ["2214104_43"]="...",
  ["2214104_44"]="Since the Library of Babel has reopened, let's not let that well-made pathfinder go to waste.",
  ["2214104_45"]="Get its parameters adjusted, and I'll take it to the new starting sector for the Path of No Return.",
  ["2214104_46"]="Awesome!",
  ["2214104_5"]="Huh?",
  ["2214104_6"]="Thankfully, I'm not too late.",
  ["2214104_7"]="I need an explanation for this.",
  ["2214104_8"]="Sorry about that! It's my fault!",
  ["2214104_9"]="Well, even though it looks and behaves like an arithmetic unit...",
  ["2214105_1"]="Sometime, somewhere in an Unknown Sector.",
  ["2214105_10"]="What makes you think so? Tell me! Tell me!",
  ["2214105_11"]="So, where are we headed next?",
  ["2214105_12"]="I never thought you'd be the one to change the subject! Alright, let's head over there... quickly!",
  ["2214105_2"]="Wait, what's that incredibly fast thing that just zoomed past?",
  ["2214105_3"]="It feels like some kind of super-sweeper! But I'm sure it has even more awesome functions!",
  ["2214105_4"]="Argh! What the heck was that thing? Why was it running so fast? I can't see it anymore!",
  ["2214105_5"]="If only I could catch it somehow...",
  ["2214105_6"]="...",
  ["2214105_7"]="You and that thing look alike, in a way.",
  ["2214105_8"]="Me? Look like that thing? Seriously?!",
  ["2214105_9"]="...",
  ["2215101_1"]="Some day after I became the Head Librarian of Eme-an, a fellow librarian approached me with a request one day...",
  ["2215101_10"]="As far as I remember, the area around Known Sector 225 isn't dangerous.",
  ["2215101_11"]="Well, it used to be safe...",
  ["2215101_12"]="Used to be?",
  ["2215101_13"]="The sectors in that vicinity have traps that could harm fragile human bodies. For some reason, they've been activated.",
  ["2215101_14"]="Even if you know how to deactivate those traps, you might get hampered or even injured by them before you can actually deactivate them.",
  ["2215101_15"]="As you can see, I'm not physically strong.",
  ["2215101_16"]="...",
  ["2215101_17"]="Please help me with it! I'll tell you how to turn off those traps remotely!",
  ["2215101_18"]="So, we're leaving?",
  ["2215101_19"]="Sure, go for it!",
  ["2215101_2"]="Gosh! Look who we have here! The almighty time machine, the backbone of Eme-an, and the new director of the Library of Babel, personally coming to do me a favor!",
  ["2215101_3"]="Pfft.",
  ["2215101_4"]="...",
  ["2215101_5"]="What's going on?",
  ["2215101_6"]="Well, long story short, I need someone to go to Known Sector 225 and retrieve some very important research data for me.",
  ["2215101_7"]="Why don't you go there yourself?",
  ["2215101_8"]="Um... because the adjacent region to that sector is too dangerous for an ordinary researcher like me, so I'm counting on you!",
  ["2215101_9"]="...",
  ["2215102_1"]="I'm impressed that you made it here without triggering any traps!",
  ["2215102_10"]="Now you owe me an explanation.",
  ["2215102_11"]="Well, here's the thing: I designed all the traps outside.",
  ["2215102_12"]="I thought I could test their effectiveness.",
  ["2215102_13"]="But for some reason, I couldn't deactivate them, and I ended up trapped here.",
  ["2215102_14"]="I felt embarrassed asking for help when I'm the one who designed the traps, so I glossed over the situation a bit...",
  ["2215102_15"]="Ha... Hahaha...",
  ["2215102_16"]="Why couldn't you deactivate them, considering you are the designer?",
  ["2215102_17"]="Well, I managed to deactivate them in most cases.",
  ["2215102_18"]="However, during the debugging process, I noticed that if I activate those traps in a certain order, they go rogue and can't be controlled.",
  ["2215102_19"]="Yeah, as you can see, if we activate this one first, and then that one...",
  ["2215102_2"]="...",
  ["2215102_20"]="No! Wait!",
  ["2215102_3"]="The traps I designed are truly remarkable!",
  ["2215102_4"]="As I suspected, you were the one who designed all those traps!",
  ["2215102_5"]="But hey, wait, why are you here? Didn't you send us to retrieve your research data?",
  ["2215102_6"]="That's correct. I'm the most important \"research data\" for my project.",
  ["2215102_7"]="The most important \"research data\" is the researcher themself...",
  ["2215102_8"]="Hmm, that makes sense.",
  ["2215102_9"]="Huh?!",
  ["2215103_1"]="The console emits a loud buzzing sound before going silent and becoming unresponsive.",
  ["2215103_10"]="It seems like all the traps have been activated once again.",
  ["2215103_11"]="And... oops... I accidentally activated another trap that was still in the testing phase.",
  ["2215103_12"]="And since I've input too many repetitive operations in a short time, the switches to those traps... well... you know...",
  ["2215103_13"]="Why am I not at all surprised?",
  ["2215103_14"]="What do we do now?",
  ["2215103_15"]="There's one last option...",
  ["2215103_16"]="Shoot it.",
  ["2215103_17"]="Cut off the power supply.",
  ["2215103_18"]="Where is it located?",
  ["2215103_19"]="I'll mark the location for you.",
  ["2215103_2"]="Hey!",
  ["2215103_20"]="Let's go.",
  ["2215103_3"]="...",
  ["2215103_4"]="Huh?",
  ["2215103_5"]="...",
  ["2215103_6"]="...",
  ["2215103_7"]="...",
  ["2215103_8"]="...",
  ["2215103_9"]="What just happened?",
  ["2215104_1"]="Finally, those traps stopped working.",
  ["2215104_10"]="Luckily, I've saved all the test data this time.",
  ["2215104_11"]="Are you planning to build more traps in the office area?!",
  ["2215104_12"]="...",
  ["2215104_13"]="Well, perhaps not. I guess unstable traps can end up harming you instead of protecting against threats.",
  ["2215104_14"]="Thank goodness, you finally get it!",
  ["2215104_15"]="Maybe my current research direction isn't right for me, after all.",
  ["2215104_16"]="I should focus on something else!",
  ["2215104_17"]="My days as a trap master are over! It's time for a fresh start in a new research field!",
  ["2215104_18"]="It is all over now. The librarian learned his lesson and is ready to embark on new endeavors.",
  ["2215104_19"]="Good luck with your new ventures.",
  ["2215104_2"]="I'm so exhausted.",
  ["2215104_20"]="Just be more careful with buttons in the future.",
  ["2215104_21"]="Hmm... if I design something similar again, perhaps I should add a proper switch and a password just in case...",
  ["2215104_3"]="Noooooooo...",
  ["2215104_4"]="What's wrong now?!",
  ["2215104_5"]="Looks like the power outage damaged my traps.",
  ["2215104_6"]="They're all ruined now.",
  ["2215104_7"]="...",
  ["2215104_8"]="...",
  ["2215104_9"]="Ahem, pull yourself together, would you?",
  ["2216101_1"]="Around World Calendar 2500 B.C., in our quest for the commands to control Aten, we came across a soldier separated from the Immortal Army.",
  ["2216101_10"]="What's this?",
  ["2216101_11"]="After he finishes reciting, he opens his eyes and cradles the papyrus gently.",
  ["2216101_12"]="This inscription... it was originally engraved on a stone monument that glorifies His Majesty's greatness.",
  ["2216101_13"]="But while the stone monument lasts forever, it's just an inanimate object. His Majesty's kingdom is vast, and the monument alone can't convey his magnificence to every citizen.",
  ["2216101_14"]="It's our responsibility to spread word of His Majesty's achievements to every corner of the world.",
  ["2216101_15"]="Spread word of his achievements... Tsk...",
  ["2216101_16"]="But why are you alone? Where are your companions?",
  ["2216101_17"]="I alone am not enough to spread word of His Majesty's great achievements.",
  ["2216101_18"]="We had a full squad at first, but since we entered this tower, we've faced treacherous obstacles and ferocious monsters. Despite our vigilance, our numbers have dwindled.",
  ["2216101_19"]="I can't remember the exact day, but when I woke up from a deep sleep one morning, I was the only one left, surrounded by those dreadful monsters.",
  ["2216101_2"]="Are you Eme-ans?",
  ["2216101_20"]="When I saw the monsters carrying my comrades' belongings, it was clear that they had been brutally killed.",
  ["2216101_21"]="I wanted to escape, but the monsters took the manuscripts my comrades carried as well.",
  ["2216101_22"]="Those manuscripts must not fall into the hands of those filthy monsters.",
  ["2216101_23"]="I may not be a great warrior, but I can at least retrieve the sculptures that glorify His Majesty...",
  ["2216101_24"]="His voice fades, and his gaze grows distant. Without waiting for our reaction, he raises his weapon, straightens up, and heads deeper into the darkness.",
  ["2216101_3"]="Thank you for saving me.",
  ["2216101_4"]="What did you find just now?",
  ["2216101_5"]="...",
  ["2216101_6"]="He reaches into his pocket and takes out a sheet of papyrus.",
  ["2216101_7"]="Instead of looking at it, he closes his eyes and starts murmuring.",
  ["2216101_8"]="His voice is not loud, but his words are strong and clear.",
  ["2216101_9"]="I, Darius, the King of All Kings favored by a thousand gods, am erecting this monument at the Great Waterfall of the Memphis River in honor of my feats.",
  ["2216102_1"]="Hey!",
  ["2216102_2"]="Should we just leave him alone?",
  ["2216102_3"]="Perhaps we should follow him?",
  ["2216102_4"]="Let's follow him.",
  ["2216102_5"]="Hmph.",
  ["2216102_6"]="Sure.",
  ["2216103_1"]="I have conquered the lands through which this river flows. I have retrieved the sun that sank into this river. I have expanded the borders of my domain to the southern end of the world.",
  ["2216103_10"]="...",
  ["2216103_11"]="The soldier's spirit reignites as he recalls the tales, but his newfound vitality quickly dwindles after a few words.",
  ["2216103_12"]="This sudden change concerns me.",
  ["2216103_13"]="You're in bad shape.",
  ["2216103_14"]="...",
  ["2216103_15"]="I'm sorry... I haven't been able to close my eyes since my companions vanished... That's why I'm feeling a bit... down.",
  ["2216103_16"]="You haven't slept since then? How long has it been?",
  ["2216103_17"]="I don't know how long it's been. I'm just afraid that if I close my eyes, I'll never open them again...",
  ["2216103_18"]="I haven't retrieved all the manuscripts that glorify His Majesty from the monsters...",
  ["2216103_19"]="We'll help you collect those manuscripts.",
  ["2216103_2"]="Holding the newly acquired papyrus in his hands, he closes his eyes and recites a chant without even looking at the contents.",
  ["2216103_20"]="...",
  ["2216103_21"]="I don't know how to express my gratitude. You've saved me twice.",
  ["2216103_22"]="Let's go.",
  ["2216103_3"]="Although he stands tall, his breath weakens noticeably after reciting the chant.",
  ["2216103_4"]="You know what it says without looking at it?",
  ["2216103_5"]="I've gone through these pages countless times. I remember every word just by looking at the back of it.",
  ["2216103_6"]="Moreover, I have accompanied His Majesty's army, witnessing his magnificent deeds firsthand.",
  ["2216103_7"]="His Majesty embarked on an expedition to Memphis, and wherever his army went, slaves and nobles alike were awed by his greatness.",
  ["2216103_8"]="Memphis was eventually drawn into the borders of His Majesty's domain.",
  ["2216103_9"]="Then His Majesty retrieved the God of the Sun who slumbered beneath the majestic waterfalls of Memphis. Even the god was conquered by His Majesty!",
  ["2216104_1"]="I pardon the prisoners of Memphis, as long as they abide by my laws. I reward the warriors of the Immortal Army with the lands and riches they desire.",
  ["2216104_10"]="I'm sorry. I lost control for a moment.",
  ["2216104_11"]="Take a rest.",
  ["2216104_12"]="We should collect the manuscripts first.",
  ["2216104_13"]="If you can memorize the content...",
  ["2216104_14"]="Why do you insist on retrieving the manuscripts?",
  ["2216104_15"]="...",
  ["2216104_16"]="Because I must.",
  ["2216104_17"]="Such blind loyalty.",
  ["2216104_18"]="Let's go.",
  ["2216104_19"]="Thank you.",
  ["2216104_2"]="After he raises his spirits to recite the chant, his condition visibly deteriorates.",
  ["2216104_3"]="If it weren't for His Majesty's kindness and generosity...",
  ["2216104_4"]="I'm afraid I would have...",
  ["2216104_5"]="...",
  ["2216104_6"]="...",
  ["2216104_7"]="His voice grows faint and intermittent, barely audible.",
  ["2216104_8"]="Are you alright?",
  ["2216104_9"]="He stands frozen for a moment before gradually regaining his composure.",
  ["2216105_1"]="What is going on here?",
  ["2216105_2"]="Something seems off...",
  ["2216105_3"]="They're not attacking us, and they're in a tight formation.",
  ["2216105_4"]="It looks like a well-disciplined army.",
  ["2216105_5"]="...",
  ["2216105_6"]="That's the manuscript.",
  ["2216106_1"]="Ahh, finally, I've collected them all.",
  ["2216106_10"]="...",
  ["2216106_11"]="...",
  ["2216106_2"]="Sorry, but... I need a little break...",
  ["2216106_3"]="In case I don't open my eyes again, you can keep the manuscripts.",
  ["2216106_4"]="I've already memorized the contents, but there must be others who haven't witnessed his glory. They can learn from the manuscripts, right?",
  ["2216106_5"]="I'm afraid... I can't go on any longer...",
  ["2216106_6"]="I heard the Eme-ans in the Tower of Babel are the most knowledgeable people in the kingdom. I believe you'll keep those manuscripts safe.",
  ["2216106_7"]="Maybe more people will have the chance to see them.",
  ["2216106_8"]="...",
  ["2216106_9"]="...",
  ["2216107_1"]="\"I free slaves, relieve beggars, and shelter the elderly, women, and children.\"",
  ["2216107_2"]="Yet, how can a slave repay his benevolence?",
  ["2216107_3"]="What can a weakling who is unfit to be a warrior do for him?",
  ["2216107_4"]="Since you can't fight for my honor on the battlefield, stand behind me, embrace my glory, witness my achievements, and extol my greatness.",
  ["2216107_5"]="Let the world know that I, Darius, the King of All Kings, favored by a thousand gods, am a hero, a champion, and a benevolent ruler.",
  ["2216107_6"]="Yeah, right. I'm no longer a slave. I'm a loyal subject of the king, and as a subject, I should...",
  ["2216107_7"]="That's the reason I've been following His Majesty...",
  ["2216107_8"]="I shall bear witness to his feats; I shall extol his greatness; I shall follow him on his expeditions to every corner of this world...",
  ["2216107_9"]="I shall let the world know that His Majesty...",
  ["2216108_1"]="As he thinks, he closes his eyes and never opens them again.",
  ["2216108_2"]="A monster rises and naturally joins the other monsters already in formation.",
  ["2216108_3"]="As if they were companions all along.",
  ["2216108_4"]="As if they were awaiting his return.",
  ["2216108_5"]="As if they were always a well-disciplined army.",
  ["2216108_6"]="Slowly but steadily, they march towards the depths of the Library. Their expedition unfolds.",
  ["2216108_7"]="An expedition stretching as far as the eye can see, so that the world will hear about the King of All Kings...",
  ["2217101_1"]="Hey, why are you sticking around?",
  ["2217101_2"]="Hey, why are you sticking around?",
  ["2217101_3"]="I'm here to help you out.",
  ["2217101_4"]="Help me out... Alright, but let's be clear: this task isn't a walk in the park.",
  ["2217101_5"]="You must have seen all the havoc those wild beasts caused on our way here, right?",
  ["2217101_6"]="As Xin says, the streets we traversed appear chaotic, starkly contrasting their typically organized state.",
  ["2217101_7"]="The evacuation spot won't be looking too promising, I'm afraid.",
  ["2217101_8"]="We've got to pick up the pace.",
  ["2217102_1"]="Isn't this supposed to be the evacuation point? Why are there so few people here? Where's everyone else?",
  ["2217102_2"]="Most of the residents here... are still stuck in their houses.",
  ["2217102_3"]="This part of town is close to the river. The Cerulean Blight outbreak here is way worse than we thought.",
  ["2217102_4"]="The evacuation was only halfway done when beasts infected by Cerulean Blight broke through the blockade and swarmed the streets. Many residents got scattered, some stuck outside, others trapped indoors...",
  ["2217102_5"]="But the clock is ticking. If we can't finish the evacuation on time, other areas will be in trouble too.",
  ["2217102_6"]="If that happens, things will spiral out of control...",
  ["2217102_7"]="No wonder this operation was so urgent...",
  ["2217102_8"]="Don't worry, I'm used to handling situations like this. I'll take care of those beasts blocking our path!",
  ["2217103_1"]="When Xin turns the doorknob, only a dull metallic friction is produced. The door remains immobile.",
  ["2217103_2"]="Ugh... why is the door locked?",
  ["2217103_3"]="Hey there! We're here to evacuate and help. Could someone come down and unlock the door?",
  ["2217103_4"]="You're the rescuers? Hurry up and get me out! When the chaos hit, those beasts outside busted the lock!",
  ["2217103_5"]="We can't open it now! We're trapped in here!",
  ["2217103_6"]="Looks like I'll have to break the lock.",
  ["2217104_1"]="No worries. The door's open now.",
  ["2217104_10"]="Should we escort them there?",
  ["2217104_11"]="Should we keep fending off those beasts?",
  ["2217104_12"]="No need. That growl came from far away.",
  ["2217104_13"]="Let's head to the next block.",
  ["2217104_2"]="Let's hurry to the evacuation point. You'll be safe once we get there.",
  ["2217104_3"]="Can... can we wait a bit longer...?",
  ["2217104_4"]="Why wait? The door's open! Do you want to get surrounded by those beasts?",
  ["2217104_5"]="We were halfway in line when those beasts broke in... I'm scared they might...",
  ["2217104_6"]="Before the resident finishes her words, a series of low grunts interrupt her.",
  ["2217104_7"]="Gah! W-what was that noise?!",
  ["2217104_8"]="Just clam down! Let's get moving!",
  ["2217104_9"]="Startled, the resident looks around before shifting her gaze to Xin stationed at the roadside. Then, with a resolute blink, she swiftly makes her way towards the evacuation spot.",
  ["2217105_1"]="Finally, someone's here...",
  ["2217105_2"]="Those beasts have been blocking this spot for hours. I was worried they'd break in with all that noise!",
  ["2217105_3"]="They won't break in, not on my watch. By the way, I need to ask you something.",
  ["2217105_4"]="Reassured by Xin's words, the resident nods.",
  ["2217105_5"]="You live in Peace Community, right?... Have you seen Xiaoyun?",
  ["2217105_6"]="No, never seen her. But didn't her parents take her along on a business trip?",
  ["2217105_7"]="...I see.",
  ["2217106_1"]="Good, everything is sorted now.",
  ["2217106_10"]="Anyhow, let's forget about the repairs and get out of here quickly.",
  ["2217106_2"]="But we're so close to the evacuation point. How did you end up getting stuck here?",
  ["2217106_3"]="Well... I'm responsible for maintaining the signal station in this area. Today, I was asked to fix the station damaged by the beasts.",
  ["2217106_4"]="I heard some growls on my way here, but I didn't pay much attention and just kept working.",
  ["2217106_5"]="When those growls turned into roars, I suddenly realized I was surrounded by packs of beasts...",
  ["2217106_6"]="Ugh, not sure if I should commend you for keeping your cool or give you an earful for being a bit slow on the uptake.",
  ["2217106_7"]="By the way, did you meet someone named Xiaoyun in this block?",
  ["2217106_8"]="Not really. I only moved here last month, so I haven't had a chance to meet all the locals yet.",
  ["2217106_9"]="...I see.",
  ["2217107_1"]="You've mentioned that name a few times...",
  ["2217107_10"]="Let's check up on her once the evacuation is done.",
  ["2217107_11"]="I'll help you look for her then.",
  ["2217107_12"]="...",
  ["2217107_13"]="Yeah, hopefully we'll bump into her soon.",
  ["2217107_2"]="Who is that \"Xiaoyun\" exactly?",
  ["2217107_3"]="She was my... classmate who lives around here. I met her when Qing took me to cram school.",
  ["2217107_4"]="She's a sweet girl. She used to help me with my homework after classes and even shared her snacks with me.",
  ["2217107_5"]="But her parents are usually tied up with work and aren't around much, so she spends a lot of time alone.",
  ["2217107_6"]="I wouldn't usually worry about her, but with all this evacuation chaos...",
  ["2217107_7"]="Did you spot her at the evacuation site?",
  ["2217107_8"]="No, that's why I'm so worried!",
  ["2217107_9"]="I hope she's safe.",
  ["2217108_1"]="Huh? Why are you still holding onto this stuff at this hour?",
  ["2217108_10"]="Xin accepts the certificate, but it does not take long before she scratches her head in frustration.",
  ["2217108_11"]="Deto... nation? And quali... fication? What's that supposed to mean?",
  ["2217108_12"]="It's \"detonation qualification.\"",
  ["2217108_13"]="Hey, I know those words! It's just... not all coming back to me at once!",
  ["2217108_14"]="Okay, just leave it.",
  ["2217108_15"]="We'll make sure you're safe during the evacuation.",
  ["2217108_2"]="Just drop it and head to the evacuation spot.",
  ["2217108_3"]="No! Don't drop it!",
  ["2217108_4"]="This crate is loaded with explosives!",
  ["2217108_5"]="Huh? Explosives? What's the deal with that?",
  ["2217108_6"]="Are you trying to wreck the city? Spill the beans!",
  ["2217108_7"]="No... no! It's not what you think!",
  ["2217108_8"]="These explosives are exclusively designed for clearing the rocks blocking the path.",
  ["2217108_9"]="Look! Here's my license.",
  ["2217401_1"]="Alright, barricade cleared. The hospital is just up ahead.",
  ["2217402_3"]="This path's a straight shot, but it's crawling with these creepy things. There's nowhere to hide.",
  ["2217402_4"]="Don't rush in recklessly! Use the Cerulean Crystal and insect eggs to lure them away.",
  ["2217403_1"]="Tsk, what a hassle. These crystals are sprouting up in front of the hospital.",
  ["2217403_3"]="Let me know when you're ready.",
  ["2217403_4"]="If we want to make it through, we'll have to bust our way out... but all that noise could attract all the beasts we dodged earlier. The upside is, we're quite a distance from Xiaoyun's place.",
  ["2217404_1"]="Gosh, that was too loud! It's attracting all the beasts nearby!",
  ["2217404_2"]="Guess we'll have to deal with them all.",
  ["2217601_1"]="Quite a few beasts have gathered here overnight, it seems.",
  ["2217601_2"]="You keep an eye out for Xiaoyun. I'll handle those beasts.",
  ["2217602_1"]="All clear. No more pesky beasts!",
  ["2217602_2"]="Let's head down this way. The exit is just at the end of the street.",
  ["2217603_1"]="Massive Cerulean Crystals overlap, transforming the expansive block into a one-way thoroughfare.",
  ["2217603_2"]="At the end of this path strolls swarms of contaminated beasts. Their sheer numbers are so overwhelming that even Xin might struggle to navigate through unscathed.",
  ["2217603_3"]="Argh, these pesky beasts won't let us leave! I'll carve a path through!",
  ["2217603_4"]="Brandishing her spear, Xin forcefully strikes at the obstructing crystals.",
  ["2217603_5"]="However, instead of the expected sound of crystals shattering, a deep, dull vibration emanates.",
  ["2217603_6"]="No, it's not working. These rocks are way too solid.",
  ["2217603_7"]="Guess we'll have to push through these beasts.",
  ["2217604_1"]="Took down one group, more to go... These weird oxen and birds just keep coming...",
  ["2217604_10"]="But there are so many beasts around. Even you...",
  ["2217604_11"]="I understand the situation.",
  ["2217604_12"]="...And that's exactly why I need to do this.",
  ["2217604_13"]="I need you to bring some reinforcements here... I need your help.",
  ["2217604_14"]="I rarely rely on others, so don't let me down.",
  ["2217604_15"]="Somewhat surprised by Xin's plea for assistance, I suddenly realize that the girl standing before me is not as resilient as she appears.",
  ["2217604_16"]="Xin...",
  ["2217604_17"]="Are you trembling?",
  ["2217604_18"]="Xin's hands are trembling slightly. Having fought for food with wild beasts in the wilderness, she understands the consequences if left alone.",
  ["2217604_19"]="However, she has no alternative but to take a desperate gamble: betting her life on the possibility that Xiaoyun and I will escape safely and keep my promise.",
  ["2217604_2"]="Whenever we repel a pack of beasts, a new pack is attracted by the clamor of battle... Unwittingly, we find ourselves encircled from all directions.",
  ["2217604_20"]="Enough talking! Just do as I said!",
  ["2217604_21"]="Xin!",
  ["2217604_22"]="Without another glance in my direction, she dashes forward without hesitation.",
  ["2217604_23"]="The lance in her grasp sweeps over the Cerulean Crystals lining the path like a drumstick, emitting buzzing hums.",
  ["2217604_24"]="The corrupted beasts are immediately drawn to the noise, converging in her direction.",
  ["2217604_3"]="Following several exhausting battles, Xin is already covered in sweat. The situation does not look promising.",
  ["2217604_4"]="Let's fall back for now!",
  ["2217604_5"]="Let's retreat and come up with a plan!",
  ["2217604_6"]="No use retreating now that we're here!",
  ["2217604_7"]="Besides, those beasts are blocking our way back. Going back now is just as risky as moving forward.",
  ["2217604_8"]="At this critical juncture, Xin shuts her eyes and takes a deep breath. Upon reopening them, a sense of realization seems to dawn, her voice tinged with resolve.",
  ["2217604_9"]="Take Xiaoyun and get going. I'll deal with the beasts here.",
  ["2217801_1"]="That girl is so brave. Without her and that stranger, we'd be stuck facing that swarm of aggressive beasts...",
  ["2217801_2"]="Yeah, this time, it's our turn to lend her a hand.",
  ["2217802_1"]="First aid kit, mining picks, helmets... Let's see if we need anything else.",
  ["2217802_2"]="I also have explosives for blowing up rocks. Those obstructing crystals won't be a problem anymore.",
  ["2217802_3"]="Ready to go? Let's move quickly! She's been stranded there for a while! We can't just stand around doing nothing!",
  ["2217802_4"]="I know it's urgent, but we need information to form a solid plan. Let's wait for updates from the rescue team.",
  ["2217803_1"]="Cameras show a relatively small number of beasts at the eastern entrance, so we should be able to enter from that side...",
  ["2217803_2"]="We need to balance efficiency and the safety of our team to minimize the beasts' impact on the rescue mission...",
  ["2217804_1"]="Dark green crystals are obstructing the intersection. Their formation is so dense that finding a passageway seems nearly impossible.",
  ["2217804_2"]="This path is blocked.",
  ["2217804_3"]="Should we find another route?",
  ["2217804_4"]="Hey, don't I have a mining pick for this? Step back! I'll take care of it!",
  ["2217804_5"]="I'll pitch in too. Let me give you a hand!",
  ["2217804_6"]="The residents begin forging a path with various tools. Soon, a path is carved through the crystals.",
  ["2217805_1"]="The barricade bears marks left by beasts clashing. It now looks dilapidated and could break at the lightest touch.",
  ["2217805_2"]="Xin is up ahead on the street.",
  ["2217805_3"]="Cameras show a large number of beasts roaming there... Everyone, follow instructions and stay safe.",
  ["2217806_1"]="Ahh! This rock is too tough to break through!",
  ["2217806_2"]="But what now? The beasts are closing in!",
  ["2217806_3"]="It occurs to me that these massive crystal clusters have previously blocked our way.",
  ["2217806_4"]="Not even Xin could destroy the solid stone. It seems impossible for us to dig through with just shovels and picks.",
  ["2217806_5"]="Hey, who needs a demolition expert here?",
  ["2217806_6"]="He retrieves tightly wrapped explosives from his backpack, deftly affixing them to the joints between the clusters.",
  ["2217806_7"]="Okay, I'm going to detonate the explosives. Everyone, step back.",
  ["2217807_1"]="Don't... come...",
  ["2217807_2"]="It's... dangerous...",
  ["2217807_3"]="Despite her legs faltering and her vision blurring, Xin exerts herself to uphold her stance.",
  ["2217807_4"]="Oh no, this is terrible... She needs help right away.",
  ["2217807_5"]="Quick, let's clear a path together!",
  ["2219101_1"]="Tang Sect Flying Darts? ? Wait, isn't this just like a regular dart?",
  ["2219102_1"]="Tang Sect disciples are all about that elusive style, right? Their Flying Darts are like their top-secret weapon. They wouldn't just flaunt it for everyone to see on the street... Oh, I get it now, you're selling toys.",
  ["2219103_1"]="Do you know about that secret technique... the one where they pierce heavy armor with just an iron needle?",
  ["2219103_2"]="Hey, hey...! We're not running a circus here!",
  ["2219103_3"]="So... I heard Tang Sect disciples can turn anything they touch into deadly weapons. How about showing us this cool move?",
  ["2219103_4"]="Sounds like something out of a magic show!",
  ["2219103_5"]="I mean, Flying Darts are just... Flying Darts, you know?",
  ["2219103_6"]="Well, that's that then.",
  ["2219104_1"]="Sorry, not really catching my interest.",
  ["2219104_2"]="Okay then... I'll leave you be.",
  ["2219105_1"]="Flying Darts? Oh, you mean those weapons that fly like shooting stars in kung-fu novels, right?",
  ["2219105_2"]="I'd love to see that in action! Where's your show happening again?",
  ["2219105_3"]="It's just up ahead, at the intersection. This way, please!",
  ["2219106_1"]="Hey, I've seen your posts on the forum.",
  ["2219106_2"]="Ahh! You're the heroine from Tang Sect, aren't you?",
  ["2219106_3"]="Heroine? Ahaha... it's a bit awkward to admit that, but yeah!",
  ["2219106_4"]="Don't mention it. It's just part of being a Tang Sect member.",
  ["2219106_5"]="Where's your kite?",
  ["2219106_6"]="It's up on the roof over there, but it's a mess up there that we haven't cleaned yet, so we can't reach it.",
  ["2219106_7"]="Let me take care of this.",
  ["2219107_1"]="Yikes, this smells awful!",
  ["2219107_2"]="Has nobody cleaned up this area since the Cerulean Crystals blocked it off?",
  ["2219107_3"]="I'll just grab the kite and leave.",
  ["2219108_1"]="*Cough* Here's your kite!",
  ["2219108_10"]="Anyway, I'll go change into clean clothes first and then think about how to build my reputation.",
  ["2219108_11"]="Help! Robbery!",
  ["2219108_12"]="Tsk, a robbery in broad daylight... Looks like I'll have to step up, even with my less-than-perfect image.",
  ["2219108_2"]="Thank you so much!",
  ["2219108_3"]="No problem at all... Glad I could help.",
  ["2219108_4"]="Are you alright?",
  ["2219108_5"]="Are you alright?",
  ["2219108_6"]="Nope, not at all! Something's definitely not okay!",
  ["2219108_7"]="I can't stand how I smell right now!",
  ["2219108_8"]="Trying to find a kite in this mess doesn't exactly look elegant, don't you think?",
  ["2219108_9"]="I was trying to promote the Tang Sect, but that... that almost cost me my followers.",
  ["2219109_1"]="Gotcha! Stay right there!",
  ["2219109_10"]="Just... just don't try any of your Tang Sect tricks on me!",
  ["2219109_11"]="...",
  ["2219109_12"]="Where are you getting all this crazy information from...?",
  ["2219109_13"]="I get the feeling you're picturing my sect as some creepy cult with skulls hanging on the walls.",
  ["2219109_14"]="Azi takes out a small bottle and pours out a few pills, dispensing a few pills into the robber's mouth swiftly.",
  ["2219109_15"]="*Cough* You... you... My tongue! I...",
  ["2219109_2"]="What rotten luck. Why would anyone bother helping out these days... Hold on a second! Weren't you the girl throwing darts on the street earlier? You said you were from Tang Sect?!",
  ["2219109_3"]="You... you... aren't you worried about the Bureau of Civil Security coming after you?",
  ["2219109_4"]="The moment the subdued robber turns his gaze towards Azi, the fierce look on his face instantly dissipates, his legs giving way as he collapses to the ground.",
  ["2219109_5"]="Hey, you're the one doing the robbing here! Why would the Bureau of Civil Security come after me?",
  ["2219109_6"]="I... I... I've heard stories about what Tang Sect people do to others!",
  ["2219109_7"]="Don't you have those infamous pills that supposedly cause more agony than death itself?!",
  ["2219109_8"]="Look, we live in a society with laws! Even a criminal like me has rights!",
  ["2219109_9"]="I'm going to charge you with excessive force... and intentional harm, got it!",
  ["2219110_1"]="The event venue is already filled with onlookers, possibly due to the success of the \"Flying Darts\" campaign.",
  ["2219110_10"]="Since it's a competition, we need a referee, right?",
  ["2219110_11"]="But I doubt many would risk trying milk tea linked to Tang Sect.",
  ["2219110_12"]="So, I'll have to find someone I trust to be the referee.",
  ["2219110_13"]="Sounds like you're talking about some shady deals?",
  ["2219110_14"]="I'll ensure my judging is fair and impartial.",
  ["2219110_15"]="Sounds like you're talking about some shady deals?",
  ["2219110_16"]="I'll ensure my judging is fair and impartial.",
  ["2219110_17"]="Hey, don't underestimate my sect! I'm sure I'll win this contest!",
  ["2219110_18"]="Xin approaches me and sets a small bowl before me.",
  ["2219110_19"]="Here, give it a try. Feels like it's lacking something. Maybe I should add more pepper or something?",
  ["2219110_2"]="This is not unexpected as Tang Sect is renowned for its poison skills. The association of milk tea with Tang Sect naturally piques the curiosity of ordinary citizens, even if they are hesitant to try it.",
  ["2219110_20"]="The liquid in the bowl bears a dark brown hue resembling petroleum, with noticeable viscosity.",
  ["2219110_21"]="What exactly is this?",
  ["2219110_22"]="Hmm... milk tea?",
  ["2219110_23"]="Wait, you're not sure yourself?!",
  ["2219110_24"]="I've heard that milk tea drinkers like bitter flavors, so I added some chili and sugar to balance it out. And I know some people enjoy the tang of lemon tea, so I threw in some lemon slices too.",
  ["2219110_25"]="This way, everyone can enjoy what they like.",
  ["2219110_26"]="It's just that... the milk and tea ratio seems lower than I expected. Maybe I should call it \"Creamy Lemon Chili Mix\"?",
  ["2219110_27"]="I... I'll try it later.",
  ["2219110_28"]="Sure thing, I'll leave it here. I'm sure the other contestants will be presenting their work soon too.",
  ["2219110_29"]="The content within the book doesn't appear promising...",
  ["2219110_3"]="Yet, for some reason, all the familiar faces from WeiShi are giving me sympathetic looks.",
  ["2219110_30"]="I might consider checking other participants' work first.",
  ["2219110_4"]="Before I can comprehend the situation, Azi sets a chair in front of me and guides me to sit.",
  ["2219110_5"]="Thank you.",
  ["2219110_6"]="I have a bad feeling about this.",
  ["2219110_7"]="You're welcome... Actually, I should be thanking you.",
  ["2219110_8"]="Hey! What's so bad about it? I'm just asking for a small favor!",
  ["2219110_9"]="It didn't take long to get participants on board, and we've got plenty of merchants eager to sponsor this contest.",
  ["2219111_1"]="At that moment, I recognize a familiar figure.",
  ["2219111_10"]="With this in mind, I take a sip...",
  ["2219111_11"]="Instantly, a bitter taste explodes my mouth, more intense than any herbal medicine I have ever encountered.",
  ["2219111_12"]="How are you feeling?",
  ["2219111_13"]="I feel like my mind's been reset.",
  ["2219111_14"]="You've got a good palate. This tea was originally brewed by Master for sobering up. It starts bitter but ends on a sweet note and helps clear your mind.",
  ["2219111_15"]="So, it's like a sobering potion?",
  ["2219111_16"]="It's more than just that. I added herbs, wild fruits, and used a traditional brewing technique. While it's great for refreshing the mind, it tastes more bitter as a downside.",
  ["2219111_17"]="How does it taste? Would you like another bowl?",
  ["2219111_18"]="No, thanks...",
  ["2219111_19"]="I prefer sweeter drinks.",
  ["2219111_2"]="What are you doing here?",
  ["2219111_3"]="I'm volunteering.",
  ["2219111_4"]="The shop owner burned his hand by accident, so I stepped in to help.",
  ["2219111_5"]="Then I got invited into the contest. Well, fate works in mysterious ways.",
  ["2219111_6"]="I decide to taste the milk tea prepared by Wushi.",
  ["2219111_7"]="The milk tea, held in the bowl, resembles white jade, emitting warmth and delicacy.",
  ["2219111_8"]="Even a slight whiff overwhelms me with its aroma.",
  ["2219111_9"]="Given the remarkable color and scent, the taste is likely to be exceptional.",
  ["2219112_1"]="I decide to taste the milk tea prepared by Xin.",
  ["2219112_2"]="Although I considered pinching my nose, I notice Xin observing me closely from a short distance.",
  ["2219112_3"]="Feeling intimidated, I have no option but to drink it.",
  ["2219112_4"]="...",
  ["2219112_5"]="The taste is peculiar and complex.",
  ["2219112_6"]="The chunky milk, soaked in a sour and spicy syrup, glides down my throat to my stomach.",
  ["2219112_7"]="Shortly after, an irritating gas rises from my stomach, assaulting up to my brain.",
  ["2219112_8"]="...I need to locate a secluded spot to rinse my mouth.",
  ["2219113_1"]="I decide to taste the milk tea prepared by Ming.",
  ["2219113_10"]="Sometimes you don't need to mention the obvious when you see through something.",
  ["2219113_11"]="Good point. I'll keep that in mind... though I doubt there'll be a next time.",
  ["2219113_12"]="Here, try this Original Milk Tea and savor its authenticity.",
  ["2219113_13"]="I take the bowl and gulp down the milk tea. It tastes pleasantly ordinary.",
  ["2219113_2"]="What's this?",
  ["2219113_3"]="Milk tea.",
  ["2219113_4"]="Without weird ingredients?",
  ["2219113_5"]="No, just some incense ash, talisman powder, and other secret ingredients.",
  ["2219113_6"]="Hah, kidding. It's just your basic milk tea. Get some milk and unsweetened tea from the store, mix them up, and give it a good shake.",
  ["2219113_7"]="And here it is. Simple and pure, with that classic milk tea flavor.",
  ["2219113_8"]="So, you're not exactly prepared.",
  ["2219113_9"]="Why didn't you just buy some bottled milk tea instead?",
  ["2219114_1"]="How about others' milk teas?",
  ["2219114_2"]="Quite innovative, I must say.",
  ["2219114_3"]="Not what I expected.",
  ["2219114_4"]="Hmhm... just some random ideas.",
  ["2219114_5"]="Just give it a few minutes. My Tang Sect Oolong Milk Tea is almost ready! Just need to add the final touch to amp up the flavor.",
  ["2219115_1"]="Now, to balance out the milky taste... Ah, got it!",
  ["2219116_1"]="And some flavor-boosting toppings... I must be a genius, right?",
  ["2219116_2"]="What did you just put in there?",
  ["2219116_3"]="Hold on, hold on! It's almost done. You can taste it yourself.",
  ["2219117_1"]="Hey! Are you the ones causing the traffic jam?",
  ["2219117_10"]="Huh? Poison? What poison?",
  ["2219117_11"]="Must be some nerve toxin! Yeah, that's it! Probably some amino-perhydroquinazoline compound! My tongue is still tingling!",
  ["2219117_12"]="...I don't get it, but just so you know, sleeping pills are strictly regulated, so spare me the drama.",
  ["2219117_13"]="I'm taking him away, then.",
  ["2219117_14"]="What was that pill you gave him earlier?",
  ["2219117_15"]="That wasn't amino... or whatever, right?",
  ["2219117_16"]="No worries. Just an effervescent tablet. How could I poison someone in front of everyone?",
  ["2219117_17"]="Ahem... I mean, we don't have that kind of \"magical\" poison, nor do we often use it.",
  ["2219117_18"]="...Ohh! Got a manicure appointment this afternoon. Help me handle the explanations, [BBNAME]. I'm out.",
  ["2219117_19"]="With those words, Azi swiftly disappears into the crowd, leaving behind a growing group of onlookers and Xin, who has just handcuffed the robber.",
  ["2219117_2"]="Azi?",
  ["2219117_20"]="It is best to blend in with the crowd and depart without attracting unwanted attention.",
  ["2219117_3"]="Gosh... didn't expect to see you here.",
  ["2219117_4"]="If you're here to arrest this guy, I've already taken care of it for you.",
  ["2219117_5"]="No... I heard there was a commotion on the main road, disrupting traffic and public order, so I came over. What's going on here?",
  ["2219117_6"]="Ohh, perfect timing, Xin. This guy tried to flee after a robbery, but Azi managed to stop him.",
  ["2219117_7"]="Hah, just doing my part.",
  ["2219117_8"]="Then... I'll take this guy in for questioning first.",
  ["2219117_9"]="W-wait a minute! She poisoned me! That's against human rights! Even criminals have rights, right? You... you should take her in too!",
  ["2219119_1"]="Mmm... this smells amazing! Even I'm impressed by my cooking skills.",
  ["2219119_10"]="Heehee, all thanks to the knowledge for \"Condensed Poison.\"",
  ["2219119_11"]="Each herb comes with its own unique properties and flavors.",
  ["2219119_12"]="So, I figured I'd add some of our herbs to give it a special twist.",
  ["2219119_13"]="What did you just put in there?",
  ["2219119_14"]="This is pretty magical...",
  ["2219119_15"]="Aconite, croton, sulfur...",
  ["2219119_16"]="So, I threw in some aconite, croton, and sulfur.",
  ["2219119_17"]="...",
  ["2219119_18"]="...All pretty potent stuff.",
  ["2219119_19"]="Please lie down, [BBNAME]. Are you feeling unwell?",
  ["2219119_2"]="Azi fills a bowl with milk tea and hands it to me.",
  ["2219119_20"]="I'm not sure what just happened... but should I call a doctor just in case?",
  ["2219119_21"]="I sense a slight twitch in my mouth, accompanied by a hint of discomfort in my stomach...",
  ["2219119_22"]="It shouldn't be too serious... hopefully. I strictly stuck to safe doses!",
  ["2219119_3"]="Come on, try it! This is my masterpiece.",
  ["2219119_4"]="The milk tea shines with a clear maroon hue... The color appears satisfactory.",
  ["2219119_5"]="As I carefully hold the bowl before me, the blend of tea aroma and milky flavor wafts up.",
  ["2219119_6"]="Recalling the lesson from the sobering soup, I cautiously take a sip.",
  ["2219119_7"]="...",
  ["2219119_8"]="The taste is wonderful!",
  ["2219119_9"]="How did you pull this off?",
  ["2219120_1"]="We're in QingYu City now. Let's split up and learn more about this \"ingenium.\"",
  ["2219121_1"]="We ascend Mount Tianque's path, climbing the steps under a clear sky. Now is an opportune moment for the ascent.",
  ["2219121_10"]="Perfect, I could use a breather too.",
  ["2219121_11"]="Azi's voice emanates from behind me.",
  ["2219121_12"]="Come here. Check this out.",
  ["2219121_13"]="Just found something interesting.",
  ["2219121_14"]="Oh? Something interesting?",
  ["2219121_15"]="As we meticulously clear the foliage and vines, an antique machine lies exposed before us.",
  ["2219121_16"]="This is...",
  ["2219121_17"]="Is this a creation from Tang Sect?",
  ["2219121_18"]="No, I believe this machine gun is even more ancient than my sect.",
  ["2219121_19"]="Many of our crossbow designs might have drawn from this, but they're not as deadly.",
  ["2219121_2"]="Unlike our previous hurried visit, this time we have sufficient time to admire the scenery in this ancient city.",
  ["2219121_20"]="She bends down, delicately touching the machine in front of her, seemingly connecting with the long history of Tang Sect.",
  ["2219121_21"]="Looks like these are defensive machines crafted by the early settlers of QingYu City.",
  ["2219121_22"]="It's almost a miracle that it's still intact today.",
  ["2219121_23"]="So, you're saying your ingenium is inspired by these machines?",
  ["2219121_24"]="But I thought ingenium was your sect's unique creation.",
  ["2219121_25"]="No, way before my sect, there were skilled craftsmen in Qian who excelled at making all sorts of tools.",
  ["2219121_26"]="Sadly, many of those tools were turned into weapons, causing harm to the people of Qian. In the end, it's always the people behind the tools.",
  ["2219121_27"]="Eventually, those craftsmen left, with many heading to the distant Western Region. They believed tools shouldn't be used for harm, aligning with Tang Sect's principles, so they joined us.",
  ["2219121_28"]="Over time, people started seeing \"ingenium\" as some kind of dark magic or ominous weapons and distanced themselves from it... which might not be a bad thing.",
  ["2219121_29"]="Better to lock away dangerous things than leave them out in the open.",
  ["2219121_3"]="Despite the cooling weather, the search for ingenium parts along the mountain path proved to be sweltering.",
  ["2219121_30"]="However...",
  ["2219121_31"]="We can't really display this machine, can we?",
  ["2219121_32"]="If we leave it here, it'll just corrode and crumble.",
  ["2219121_33"]="These relics are part of my sect's history... So, as a true disciple, I'll take them in.",
  ["2219121_34"]="This machine holds a lot of historical value.",
  ["2219121_35"]="Hmmm... How about we donate it to a museum? It could draw some attention, maybe even spark some interest and followers.",
  ["2219121_36"]="Let's keep exploring and see if there are more of these relics around.",
  ["2219121_4"]="I settle on a flat rock, my gaze instinctively drawn to a broken log at the cliff's edge.",
  ["2219121_5"]="(Approach and investigate.)",
  ["2219121_6"]="(Approach and investigate.)",
  ["2219121_7"]="Picking up a withered branch, I clear away the fallen leaves and ancient vines, revealing a curved crank made from parasol wood.",
  ["2219121_8"]="Judging by the rust on the part, it appears quite old.",
  ["2219121_9"]="...Are you just slacking off?",
  ["2219122_1"]="Looks like we're on the right track.",
  ["2219124_1"]="We've reached the peak of QingYu City! The Upper City!!!",
  ["2219125_1"]="Wasn't expecting to still see beasts around... That was a close call.",
  ["2219125_10"]="Thanks. Let's keep going up, [BBNAME].",
  ["2219125_2"]="Phew... Thank you so much.",
  ["2219125_3"]="Hold on, you can operate these ancient ingenia... Are you from Tang Sect?",
  ["2219125_4"]="You know the backstory behind these ingenia?",
  ["2219125_5"]="Yeah, I've heard a bit about it... The story goes that most of those skilled craftsmen moved to the Western Region and started the Tang Sect.",
  ["2219125_6"]="Over time, most of those ancient machines were left to rust... or used as firewood by us locals.",
  ["2219125_7"]="This is unbelievable! The authorities really need to step up and protect these cultural relics!",
  ["2219125_8"]="If you want to find more of them, try heading in that direction... but I saw lots of frenzied beasts running that way.",
  ["2219125_9"]="Please be careful.",
  ["2219126_1"]="This contraption seems to react to outside forces.",
  ["2219127_1"]="Oops... did I just break it?",
  ["2219128_1"]="What was that noise?",
  ["2219128_2"]="A beast roaring?",
  ["2219128_3"]="Someone calling for help!",
  ["2219128_4"]="Let's go check it out!",
  ["2219129_1"]="Polluted beasts continue to converge from all directions. At this point, Azi appears visibly fatigued.",
  ["2219129_2"]="Don't worry, Azi! We're here to help!",
  ["2219129_3"]="Sister Azhu, and Xin? You're here!",
  ["2219129_4"]="Darn it, why are there still polluted beasts lurking around here?",
  ["2219129_5"]="Even if we call for backup, they won't arrive in time.",
  ["2219129_6"]="Let's use the terrain to our advantage.",
  ["2219129_7"]="Can you operate these ingenia?",
  ["2219129_8"]="Let me give it a shot.",
  ["2219130_1"]="Xin skillfully deflects the snake lunging at him, flinging it aside. Azhu seizes the opportunity, leaping onto Xin's shoulder, closing in on the cerulean ape and pulling the trigger.",
  ["2219130_10"]="As a disciple of Tang Sect, it's a pleasure to see it here.",
  ["2219130_11"]="Before Azhu can finish her sentence, the rescued tourists swarm around us.",
  ["2219130_12"]="Huge thanks to all of you! If it weren't for your help, we might have been in serious trouble!",
  ["2219130_13"]="You guys are amazing! Which sect do you belong to? I'd love to send some tokens of appreciation your way.",
  ["2219130_14"]="Hey, hey... No pushing...",
  ["2219130_15"]="It's Tang Sect, right? I heard someone mention that name. And only Tang Sect disciples can handle this type of crossbow, correct?",
  ["2219130_16"]="It's your turn now, Azi.",
  ["2219130_17"]="What? My turn?",
  ["2219130_18"]="This is your moment to shine.",
  ["2219130_19"]="Want to attract more followers? Now's your chance.",
  ["2219130_2"]="Confronted with such close-range firepower, the cerulean ape howls in agony before being driven back by a barrage of crossbow bolts, tumbling over the cliff.",
  ["2219130_20"]="Finish what you started.",
  ["2219130_21"]="Ahem... listen up, everyone!",
  ["2219130_22"]="Yeah, you got it. I'm Tang Zi, a disciple of the Tang Sect.",
  ["2219130_23"]="Knew it was the Tang Sect! Who else could master such intricate devices?",
  ["2219130_24"]="Actually... our ingenia aren't all that fancy...",
  ["2219130_25"]="Yeah, I saw it myself! Those bolts launched that huge ape into the air! Tang Sect's machinery is truly impressive.",
  ["2219130_26"]="If you're interested, we can show you some of our ingenia in CangLin City...",
  ["2219130_27"]="I've heard their art of contraption stems from the long-lost Fuxi hexagrams...",
  ["2219130_28"]="Hey, guys, listen to me!",
  ["2219130_3"]="Observing this, the remaining beasts retreat, emitting soft whimpers before scattering away.",
  ["2219130_4"]="Hah, you're a hundred years too early to challenge Tang Sect disciples!",
  ["2219130_5"]="Oh, really? But just a moment ago, I heard someone shouting \"No! They're overpowering us!\"",
  ["2219130_6"]="I was just trying to trick them. There's no challenge the Tang Sect can't handle, but... where did those last few bolts come from?",
  ["2219130_7"]="I fired them.",
  ["2219130_8"]="Azhu approaches, holding a crossbow.",
  ["2219130_9"]="While looking for ingenia, I stumbled upon this crossbow, and I immediately recognized it as the prototype of our sect's repeating crossbow.",
  ["2219131_1"]="It's reacting! I'll try hitting it harder!",
  ["2219132_1"]="Well... as Xin said, they aren't really interested in the end.",
  ["2219132_10"]="Hey there! Now you can experience the Tang Sect Flying Darts!",
  ["2219132_11"]="Follow our official account and line up to give it a shot!",
  ["2219132_12"]="If you hit the target, you'll win a prize and get an extra throw!",
  ["2219132_13"]="You can win as many prizes as you like, as long as you keep hitting the target!",
  ["2219132_2"]="Tsk... looks like I'll have to lure them with tangible benefits...",
  ["2219132_3"]="Azi walks with a determined demeanor.",
  ["2219132_4"]="Trying to allure people with trivial tricks isn't our way! That's why we Tang Sect disciples prefer to keep a low profile!",
  ["2219132_5"]="Azi seizes the microphone, addressing the departing crowd with a commanding voice.",
  ["2219132_6"]="We focus on self-improvement, balancing spiritual growth and physical training, ultimately mastering our craft.",
  ["2219132_7"]="Seeing our Flying Darts merely as an assassination skill is a superficial and disrespectful perspective!",
  ["2219132_8"]="But let's skip the lecture and have a go yourselves! Feel free to try our Flying Darts and see how you fare!",
  ["2219132_9"]="Assertively, Azi showcases the Flying Darts models on the table to a few residents, pointing towards a distant target.",
  ["2219133_1"]="Azi's quick wit swiftly improves the atmosphere. The previously disinterested crowd is immediately captivated and begins forming a long queue.",
  ["2219133_10"]="If some lucky guy hits the mark, I'll just give them a small gift or something.",
  ["2219133_11"]="What if they report you to the Bureau of Culture & Tourism?",
  ["2219133_12"]="Report me? For false advertising?",
  ["2219133_13"]="I never said nobody could hit the mark at this distance. I just can't guarantee it myself.",
  ["2219133_14"]="No worries. Tang Sect will have my back on this one...",
  ["2219133_15"]="Spontaneous cheers erupt behind me.",
  ["2219133_2"]="However, an unexpected challenge arises: Azi has not prepared any prizes in advance.",
  ["2219133_3"]="I pull Azi aside momentarily.",
  ["2219133_4"]="Did you just come up with this idea out of the blue?",
  ["2219133_5"]="Yeah, it was spur of the moment.",
  ["2219133_6"]="But what about the prizes?",
  ["2219133_7"]="I asked Xin to bring some prizes... Honestly, most of them are things I secretly want for myself.",
  ["2219133_8"]="At this distance, not even I can guarantee to hit the mark. Untrained laypeople don't stand a chance.",
  ["2219133_9"]="Think of it as an advance on my allowance.",
  ["2219134_1"]="I'd like that little night light. Thank you.",
  ["2219134_10"]="...You're so mean.",
  ["2219134_2"]="Oh? Looks like we've got a lucky winner already?",
  ["2219134_3"]="Ming Xiaomin, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in class right now?!",
  ["2219134_4"]="Well, isn't social practice a part of learning too?",
  ["2219134_5"]="I heard about a special folklore event here, so I decided to take the day off for it.",
  ["2219134_6"]="Sounds like a good excuse for skipping class to me!",
  ["2219134_7"]="Just go back to your class!",
  ["2219134_8"]="At least you can hand over the prize...",
  ["2219134_9"]="I have the final say here! No using mysterious powers to cheat!",
  ["2219135_1"]="Three hits in a row! My aim is spot-on today!",
  ["2219135_2"]="Hold on! You're not even throwing the Flying Darts!",
  ["2219135_3"]="Are you intentionally crashing this campaign?!",
  ["2219135_4"]="But those prizes look so tempting...",
  ["2219135_5"]="Azi is a swindler.",
  ["2219135_6"]="Please... can we just keep this event running smoothly?",
  ["2219135_7"]="I hit the mark three times in a row... I can still keep going, right?",
  ["2219135_8"]="What? Another Flying Darts master? No way... this is definitely someone trying to cause trouble.",
  ["2219136_1"]="All five shots hit? That's seriously impressive... Please, keep going.",
  ["2219136_10"]="You talked a big game earlier. Can't let a random person outshine you now, can you?",
  ["2219136_11"]="Of all the times for this to happen...",
  ["2219136_12"]="Running away now would be too embarrassing, but I'm curious about that person's identity...",
  ["2219136_13"]="I'll go check things out for you.",
  ["2219136_14"]="Go ahead with your Flying Darts performance.",
  ["2219136_15"]="Looks like I have to defend the honor of Tang Sect after all...",
  ["2219136_16"]="Alright, I'll have to do this.",
  ["2219136_17"]="Help me chase after that troublemaker!",
  ["2219136_18"]="You've got to get back the gifts they earned!",
  ["2219136_2"]="What? All five shots hit? Wait a minute...",
  ["2219136_3"]="As Azi navigates through the crowd, she catches sight of a figure laden with gifts departing.",
  ["2219136_4"]="Who's that person? Are they here to stir up trouble?! I can't let them get away with this!",
  ["2219136_5"]="But Azi... you were the one who set the rules in front of everyone.",
  ["2219136_6"]="Just hold on a sec, sister!",
  ["2219136_7"]="That person seems like trouble! We need to stand our ground, or Tang Sect will lose face.",
  ["2219136_8"]="Before Azi can give chase, the surrounding crowd halts her.",
  ["2219136_9"]="Time for Tang Sect disciples to show their skills, right?",
  ["2219137_1"]="Phew! Flying Darts challenge done! Tang Sect's honor remains intact!",
  ["2220101_1"]="It's getting misty, and a bit dark too...",
  ["2220101_2"]="I forgot to tell Grandpa before I left...",
  ["2220101_3"]="A slight hesitation lingers within her.",
  ["2220101_4"]="Yet, this momentary pause dissipates swiftly under the urge to find the colossal bird.",
  ["2220101_5"]="I'll just be more careful.",
  ["2220101_6"]="I've got to hurry. It's probably flying farther away.",
  ["2220102_1"]="These lights... I know what they're for. Grandpa taught me before.",
  ["2220102_2"]="Each stone tablet controls two lights on both sides. I need to step on the right tablets to light them all up.",
  ["2220201_1"]="Oh, hey! You're the consultant from the community hall!",
  ["2220201_10"]="I think it might have to do with feng shui because this never happened before. Ever since I replaced the slate near my electrical box, the magnetic field in the whole area seems messed up!",
  ["2220201_11"]="Okay... alright...",
  ["2220201_12"]="Hey, I'm telling you the truth! You're a folklore counselor, right? You must know more about this than I do!",
  ["2220201_13"]="Alright... let me take a look first.",
  ["2220201_2"]="What was your name again...?",
  ["2220201_3"]="Counselor Ming! Oh, anything unusual going on lately, you ask?",
  ["2220201_4"]="You know what? I came across something strange recently!",
  ["2220201_5"]="Oh? Please go ahead.",
  ["2220201_6"]="The lights in my house have been acting up! I have to shout to get them to turn on, but I don't even have voice-controlled switches at home!",
  ["2220201_7"]="...",
  ["2220201_8"]="And that's not all!",
  ["2220201_9"]="Sometimes, I flick my own switch, and my lights stay off, but someone else's lights turn on!",
  ["2220202_1"]="Problem solved.",
  ["2220202_10"]="R-really...?",
  ["2220202_2"]="Wow, that was quick! So, what was the problem?",
  ["2220202_3"]="Just a circuit issue.",
  ["2220202_4"]="Despite how it may sound, it was simply a circuit problem.",
  ["2220202_5"]="So, it wasn't related to feng shui after all?",
  ["2220202_6"]="No, it had nothing to do with feng shui.",
  ["2220202_7"]="But you're a counselor. Shouldn't you handle feng shui matters...? Why do you know how to fix electrical boxes?",
  ["2220202_8"]="It's part of the counselor's duties, too.",
  ["2220202_9"]="Yeah... only by understanding how to fix electrical issues can we counselors truly get to the root of various problems. Makes sense, right?",
  ["2220203_1"]="Aha! If it isn't Counselor Ming!",
  ["2220203_10"]="Well, as the saying goes, \"Once you cross the palace gate, your life and death are left to fate.\"",
  ["2220203_11"]="Rumor has it that there were intense power struggles deep within the palace, with winners gaining fame and riches, while the losers faced... consequences. There are even stories of people being murdered and thrown into the well under the cloak of night!",
  ["2220203_12"]="Let's discuss this well... Huh? Wait! Did something just move inside?! Guards! Bureau of Civil Security! Someone, help!",
  ["2220203_13"]="Stay back from the well, Counselor Ming! There's something sinister in there!",
  ["2220203_14"]="Ming gazes into the well.",
  ["2220203_15"]="Watch out!",
  ["2220203_16"]="You mean that shadow?",
  ["2220203_17"]="Yeah! Look, it's still twitching!",
  ["2220203_18"]="...I'll get it.",
  ["2220203_19"]="Be careful, Counselor Ming! Don't put yourself in danger out of curiosity. You're still too young die...",
  ["2220203_2"]="Hey.",
  ["2220203_3"]="Hey, Counselor Ming! You must know a lot about the history of QingYu City!",
  ["2220203_4"]="Yeah, I did some research before I got here.",
  ["2220203_5"]="(Just my actual job turned out to be quite different from what I expected...)",
  ["2220203_6"]="Hey, perfect timing! Let me share something about this ancient well with you! There are so many legends surrounding it...",
  ["2220203_7"]="Oh? Please go ahead.",
  ["2220203_8"]="This city has been the capital for many generations, holding countless royal secrets...",
  ["2220203_9"]="How does that relate to this well?",
  ["2220204_1"]="It's just algae.",
  ["2220204_10"]="Oh! That... does make sense!",
  ["2220204_11"]="She leans in, glancing once more at the dark depths of the well.",
  ["2220204_12"]="(But something does feel strange...)",
  ["2220204_13"]="The water in this well is contaminated. Don't drink it for now.",
  ["2220204_14"]="Okay...",
  ["2220204_2"]="Algae...",
  ["2220204_3"]="The well cover might come off occasionally.",
  ["2220204_4"]="There's algae in the nearby tank.",
  ["2220204_5"]="It's the algae in the nearby tank, I suppose?",
  ["2220204_6"]="Wait, is it really that simple? Nothing sinister?",
  ["2220204_7"]="Don't scare yourself.",
  ["2220204_8"]="That was quite the story you shared, but...",
  ["2220204_9"]="Even if people in the royal palace did dispose of bodies in a well, it wouldn't be this one, right? It's too far away.",
  ["2220205_1"]="Hurry back!",
  ["2220205_10"]="Oh, will you? Thank you so much! Just be careful!",
  ["2220205_2"]="Ahh... what should I do...?",
  ["2220205_3"]="What's wrong?",
  ["2220205_4"]="Just now, a kid got curious and went onto the catwalk...",
  ["2220205_5"]="The Bureau of Culture & Tourism announced that the catwalk is damaged and undergoing maintenance. It's off-limits to the public.",
  ["2220205_6"]="I wanted to get the kid down, but if I step on the catwalk, it might collapse...",
  ["2220205_7"]="But that kid... he just won't come down. I'm really worried about what could happen...",
  ["2220205_8"]="What's worse, he's sick now...",
  ["2220205_9"]="I'll go bring him back.",
  ["2220206_1"]="Phew... made it at last.",
  ["2220206_10"]="I'll take it from here. Your job is done, it's time to go home.",
  ["2220206_11"]="I can't just pass on my duty as the Catwalk Guardian to anyone! At least not to someone without a cool title!",
  ["2220206_12"]="I am the Second Catwalk Guardian.",
  ["2220206_13"]="I am the Catwalk Lightbringer.",
  ["2220206_14"]="I am the Second Catwalk Guardian.",
  ["2220206_15"]="...Are you being offhand with me, sister?",
  ["2220206_16"]="...",
  ["2220206_17"]="I am the Catwalk Lightbringer.",
  ["2220206_18"]="Whoa! And you've got a lamp staff! You look awesome!",
  ["2220206_19"]="Perfect! I'll trust you with my task now! I'm heading back.",
  ["2220206_2"]="Sister! Come here!",
  ["2220206_20"]="The catwalk wobbles once again.",
  ["2220206_21"]="Whoa! I really mean it this time!",
  ["2220206_22"]="It's too risky. Hang on, I'll bring you back once I've checked on the bug situation.",
  ["2220206_23"]="Yeah...",
  ["2220206_3"]="Hey, it's not safe to play here.",
  ["2220206_4"]="Let's get off the catwalk.",
  ["2220206_5"]="But I can't... because I'm the Catwalk Guardian!",
  ["2220206_6"]="And there's a swarm of bugs nesting behind me!",
  ["2220206_7"]="That's why I'm here, guarding the catwalk from the bug invasion!",
  ["2220206_8"]="(...A swarm of bugs? Nesting?)",
  ["2220206_9"]="I see... Ahem, so, you're the Catwalk Guardian?",
  ["2220207_1"]="\"There exists a fish known as Lu, which perishes during winter and revives during summer.\"",
  ["2220207_10"]="Don't wander off again! You'll be in big trouble if your dad finds out!",
  ["2220207_11"]="I'm sorry...",
  ["2220207_12"]="Don't run off like that again.",
  ["2220207_13"]="Yeah! Thanks for bringing me back, Catwalk Lightbringer!",
  ["2220207_14"]="Huh? Catwalk Lightbringer?",
  ["2220207_15"]="Please, just don't ask.",
  ["2220207_2"]="These animals are documented in ancient texts...",
  ["2220207_3"]="And what about these eggs...? I never heard of such weird stuff in QingYu City before coming here.",
  ["2220207_4"]="I need to head back and report this.",
  ["2220207_5"]="Ming, we should head back now. We've spotted metalization on animals on our side...",
  ["2220207_6"]="And ordinary people can't even perceive it.",
  ["2220207_7"]="I see. I've discovered something unusual here, too.",
  ["2220207_8"]="I'll head back and report later.",
  ["2220207_9"]="Thank you so much for bringing him back!",
  ["2220301_1"]="Whoa! What just happened out there?",
  ["2220301_2"]="The weather is spooky, and there was some noise like something banging on the door! Who knows what it was!",
  ["2220301_3"]="Is this some kind of punishment because I overslept and missed my morning incense and prayer?! I don't want...",
  ["2220301_4"]="Hold on, I just did a divination. Today isn't a favorable day for you to go outside.",
  ["2220301_5"]="Huh?",
  ["2220301_6"]="Actually, it was just animals outside, likely lost in the thick mist and accidentally knocking on your gate.",
  ["2220301_7"]="So, it was just animals...",
  ["2220301_8"]="I've shooed them away. With the heavy mist, follow the advice, close the gate, and stay indoors.",
  ["2220301_9"]="Yeah, sure!",
  ["2220302_1"]="Hello? It's quite misty out here. Please stay indoors and avoid going outside.",
  ["2220302_10"]="He must have a good reason.",
  ["2220302_11"]="<color=#fec66b>He went uphill.</color>",
  ["2220302_2"]="Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to go out, just...",
  ["2220302_3"]="What happened?",
  ["2220302_4"]="Well, despite the rough weather, a guest of mine insisted on going out to offer incense and prayers!",
  ["2220302_5"]="It's been hours, and he's still not back. I'm the innkeeper, and I'd be responsible if anything goes wrong...",
  ["2220302_6"]="I'm hesitating whether to report this to the Bureau of Civil Security.",
  ["2220302_7"]="...I'll go search for him.",
  ["2220302_8"]="Really? Thank you! If you find him, please bring him back!",
  ["2220302_9"]="Going out in this weather...",
  ["2220303_1"]="Ancestors, please! Clear this mist!",
  ["2220303_10"]="I've sold everything I own. I've done all I can... but if the weather doesn't clear up, there's nothing more I can do. All that's left now is to pray to my ancestors and hope for their blessings.",
  ["2220303_11"]="I'm really sorry about all that drama, Counselor Ming.",
  ["2220303_12"]="...",
  ["2220303_13"]="Hey, don't stress about it. Your kid wouldn't want anything to happen to you.",
  ["2220303_14"]="There's got to be another way... What if we applied for a special access through Qingyu municipal-government?",
  ["2220303_15"]="A special access? Is that even possible?",
  ["2220303_16"]="The travel ban was issued to ensure the safety of residents. However, in special cases, the government does allow exceptions.",
  ["2220303_17"]="Come on, let's head back. I'll help you file the application.",
  ["2220303_18"]="You'd do that? Thank you... Thank you so much...",
  ["2220303_19"]="The innkeeper's been really worried about you.",
  ["2220303_2"]="Huh? Counselor Ming?",
  ["2220303_20"]="I'm sorry... for causing so much trouble.",
  ["2220303_3"]="And you are...?",
  ["2220303_4"]="If so, do you know of any talisman that claims to cure all illnesses?",
  ["2220303_5"]="Sorry, I guess I'm just desperate and grasping at straws.",
  ["2220303_6"]="It's you!",
  ["2220303_7"]="So, you're praying here because...",
  ["2220303_8"]="*Sigh* My boy is seriously ill. We finally got in touch with a hospital in another city and found a new treatment plan.",
  ["2220303_9"]="But then this thick fog rolled in out of nowhere, leaving us stuck here, and now there's no way to transfer him to the hospital...",
  ["2220304_1"]="A fork in the road... The innkeeper mentioned her guest was heading uphill.",
  ["2220304_2"]="But he's been gone for hours... Maybe he went downhill instead?",
  ["2220304_3"]="Let's start with the uphill path.",
  ["2220401_1"]="G-Ghost!!!!",
  ["2220401_10"]="There might be something off with the feng shui in my house, right? Come and take a look, Counselor Ming!",
  ["2220401_11"]="...Sure, I'll check it out.",
  ["2220401_2"]="...",
  ["2220401_3"]="Chill out. It's just me.",
  ["2220401_4"]="Only when Ming raises her lamp staff does the frightened resident finally see her face clearly.",
  ["2220401_5"]="Oh, it's you... Counselor Ming.",
  ["2220401_6"]="I thought it was a ghost walking around in broad daylight...",
  ["2220401_7"]="Why are you outside in such heavy mist?",
  ["2220401_8"]="That's the weird part! The mist even made its way into my house for no reason!",
  ["2220401_9"]="That's why I got a dehumidifier, and now it's stopped working for some unknown reason!",
  ["2220402_1"]="These worm eggs are sprouting again...",
  ["2220402_2"]="They don't seem alive... more like some kind of mineral...",
  ["2220402_3"]="Eggs, animals, and well water... Once I'm done here, I should report everything to my colleagues.",
  ["2220403_1"]="The mist hasn't cleared at all.",
  ["2220403_2"]="I should double-check the area I visited earlier.",
  ["2220404_1"]="(Why is it so warm inside...?)",
  ["2220404_2"]="(Just as she said, the mist here is thick.)",
  ["2220404_3"]="(The cerulean vapor came in through the open courtyard.)",
  ["2220404_4"]="(My lamp staff... seems to be dissipating the mist...)",
  ["2220404_5"]="(So, the lamp can disperse the mist... through heat? This cerulean vapor behaves like regular mist...)",
  ["2220404_6"]="(Anyway, I should clear the mist and restart the dehumidifier.)",
  ["2220405_1"]="The dehumidifier is back on. You should head inside. The courtyard is pretty much like the outdoors, and the dehumidifier's effect is limited.",
  ["2220405_10"]="But what about this strange mist...?",
  ["2220405_11"]="Mist is common during this season. Many heavy fog incidents have occurred at this time in QingYu City's history.",
  ["2220405_12"]="Plus, your house has an open courtyard. When it's foggy outside, it's natural for your courtyard to get misty too, right?",
  ["2220405_13"]="Mist... Hmm, high humidity and significant temperature difference...",
  ["2220405_14"]="By the way, I was curious: why is your courtyard so warm?",
  ["2220405_15"]="Oh, I keep it heated.",
  ["2220405_16"]="Keep it heated? Is that really necessary at this time of year?",
  ["2220405_17"]="Absolutely.",
  ["2220405_18"]="Huh?",
  ["2220405_19"]="I have a Siamese cat... I heard they turn black when they get cold... So I want to prevent that from happening too quickly...",
  ["2220405_2"]="Thank you, Counselor Ming... So, was it a feng shui problem after all?",
  ["2220405_20"]="That's quite unexpected...",
  ["2220405_21"]="Well, it seems like you're well aware of the reason yourself.",
  ["2220405_22"]="(Hmm... the mist affects animals. We mustn't leave this unchecked. I should discuss it with my colleagues later.)",
  ["2220405_23"]="Keep your cat indoors to avoid the stress from the heavy mist. Stay with her and refrain from going outside.",
  ["2220405_24"]="That makes sense! Sure thing!",
  ["2220405_25"]="Anyway, stop scaring yourself. And even if there were ghosts, they wouldn't be related to the mist, right?",
  ["2220405_26"]="So, my house is haunted after all!",
  ["2220405_27"]="No.",
  ["2220405_3"]="No.",
  ["2220405_4"]="Is my house haunted?",
  ["2220405_5"]="No.",
  ["2220405_6"]="So, my dehumidifier...",
  ["2220405_7"]="It probably shut down from running too long.",
  ["2220405_8"]="Even machines like dehumidifiers need a break now and then.",
  ["2220405_9"]="...",
  ["2220501_1"]="The streetlights up ahead are off, and it looks like there are animals in the darkness. I can't just drive by. Help me clear the road ahead, Counselor Ming!",
  ["2220501_2"]="Then I'll be waiting here for the rest of your story, sister.",
  ["2220501_3"]="Yes.",
  ["2221101_1"]="Today is another quiet day for Ziggurat Repair Shop.",
  ["2221101_10"]="If Nanna were around?",
  ["2221101_11"]="O-oh! I-it's you Nanna! What brings you here?",
  ["2221101_12"]="Calm down, just here to sort out some misplaced books as I pass through.",
  ["2221101_13"]="I see...",
  ["2221101_14"]="By the way, what brings you to the repair shop? Something is wrong with your viola?",
  ["2221101_15"]="N-no, please don't worry. Everything is fine with my viola.",
  ["2221101_16"]="Just doing some regular maintenance...",
  ["2221101_17"]="There have been a few minor issues, but I... I think I can handle them.",
  ["2221101_18"]="I need to keep this viola sealed and personally maintain it... I've got to handle it on my own. It's not too challenging.",
  ["2221101_19"]="Lowering her head, she gently runs her hand over the viola case as if comforting an old companion.",
  ["2221101_2"]="Viola stands alone at the table, rummaging through the toolbox. Her viola case is open on the table.",
  ["2221101_20"]="As a skilled artist, she alone understands how to best maintain her viola. She never allows anyone else to handle her precious instrument.",
  ["2221101_21"]="Alright then, I'll let you get back to it.",
  ["2221101_22"]="If you change your mind, I'm always here to help out.",
  ["2221101_23"]="I see... Thank you, Nanna.",
  ["2221101_24"]="Nanna nods and smiles, getting ready to leave for the next room, but briefly glances at Viola's instrument case.",
  ["2221101_25"]="(She's still a bit too reserved with everyone here.)",
  ["2221101_26"]="(I've never seen her open her viola case in public before. She usually tends to it in her own room.)",
  ["2221101_27"]="(Viola is super particular about her viola, so let's see if I can lend a hand.)",
  ["2221101_28"]="(What exactly is she looking for in the repair shop?)",
  ["2221101_29"]="If this viola were submitted to the Musical Instrument Care Contest, it could undoubtedly win the championship. Its body shines with lacquer, free of any dust on the fingerboard or under the tailpiece.",
  ["2221101_3"]="It took her half of the afternoon break to find the repair shop and then more time to locate the items she needed. Being new to the Tower of Babel, she is still unfamiliar with everything here.",
  ["2221101_30"]="Its owner never lets any dirt compromise its performance, ensuring that its sound remains flawless, just as it was the night they first met.",
  ["2221101_31"]="Next to the case, there is a soft cloth, rosin, and a small cylindrical device.",
  ["2221101_32"]="(Hmm, what could she be searching for? This part's a bit of a mystery to me.)",
  ["2221101_33"]="Nanna, as the Mentor of Eme-an, does not hesitate, as she believes that taking action is always more efficient than just thinking.",
  ["2221101_34"]="(I remember the Guide to String Instrument Care is downstairs. I'm heading there to return the book anyway, so I'll swing by and check.)",
  ["2221101_4"]="Rumor has it that eighty years ago, this room served as the workshop of an artisan who handled all repair requests from the librarians here.",
  ["2221101_5"]="While this room still houses a variety of repair tools, librarians now have to manage repairs and maintenance themselves.",
  ["2221101_6"]="Organizing and storing items in the public areas have been challenging due to many librarians leaving their tools scattered around, which makes finding the right tools extremely difficult.",
  ["2221101_7"]="No, not this box either... Where could it be?",
  ["2221101_8"]="Ahh, where on earth is it?",
  ["2221101_9"]="If Nanna were around...",
  ["2221102_1"]="A Guide to Caring for Keyboard Instruments. Nope, not this one.",
  ["2221103_1"]="On the Materials and Tones of the Harp. Nope, not this either.",
  ["2221104_1"]="Hey Nanna? Need help finding something?",
  ["2221104_2"]="A book named \"How to Replace Filter Cartridges for Humidifiers.\"",
  ["2221104_3"]="A book named \"A Guide to the Care of Stringed Instruments.\"",
  ["2221104_4"]="A Guide to the Care of Stringed Instruments? But isn't that the one you're carrying now?",
  ["2221104_5"]="If you're after spare filter cartridges for humidifiers, they're in a locked cabinet on the second floor, next to the storage room.",
  ["2221105_1"]="Nanna returns to Viola and hands her the new cartridge.",
  ["2221105_10"]="No problem at all. The repair shop is a bit of a mess, and even we're always struggling to find stuff in here.",
  ["2221105_11"]="With those words, Nanna scans the cluttered shelves and piles of boxes before her. Instinctively, she clasps her hands and narrows her eyes.",
  ["2221105_12"]="Now that you mentioned it, it might be time to tidy up all this stuff around here...",
  ["2221105_2"]="Is this the cartridge you need?",
  ["2221105_3"]="Ah, th-thank you. This is exactly what I need.",
  ["2221105_4"]="B-but how did you know I...",
  ["2221105_5"]="Heh, maybe I'm a mind reader?",
  ["2221105_6"]="Viola's eyes widen slightly in surprise, suggesting that she might be taking Nanna's joke seriously. Gratefully, she accepts Nanna's help and replaces the cartridge, restoring the humidifier's functionality.",
  ["2221105_7"]="Great... with this, the humidifier should be producing clean steam.",
  ["2221105_8"]="Thank you for your help, Nanna... I thought I could find it myself...",
  ["2221105_9"]="But I had no idea... there were piles of tools stored in the repair shop here.",
  ["2221106_1"]="So, the viola could use some conditioning oil... but this one doesn't seem right. I'll keep looking.",
  ["2221107_1"]="Hmm, looks like the bow doesn't need any special tools for maintenance either.",
  ["2221108_1"]="That reminds me. Obed's climate is dry all year round...",
  ["2221108_2"]="Ah, I see. Viola needs a tiny humidifier to keep the moisture level in check inside the case.",
  ["2221108_3"]="But where can I find a filter cartridge for the humidifier? I'll head upstairs and ask around.",
  ["2221201_1"]="On a winter day several years ago.",
  ["2221201_2"]="The sound of metal clashing echoes throughout the Tower of Babel. As one nears the training grounds, the cacophony of metal clashing grows louder, enough to discomfort any passerby's ears, prompting Nanna's quick arrival.",
  ["2221201_3"]="Phew... training grounds, here I am.",
  ["2221201_4"]="Those librarians weren't exaggerating. I could hear the racket even from two floors down.",
  ["2221201_5"]="Upon entering, Nanna peers down at the field below, watching a crimson figure moving among the training dummies, each movement marking a scythe's forceful arc.",
  ["2221201_6"]="Ereshan's movements, passed down from Nanna, are steadily improving. If it weren't for complaints from the librarians, Nanna would have gladly praised her.",
  ["2221201_7"]="On the platform, Shamash stands by, observing quietly.",
  ["2221201_8"]="So, Ere... and Shamash, you're both here. Was there a training session today that I missed?",
  ["2221202_1"]="If you were training, Shamash, I know you wouldn't be causing such a ruckus. So, what's going on here?",
  ["2221202_10"]="...",
  ["2221202_11"]="Because of Zero.",
  ["2221202_12"]="The two tacitly reach the same conclusion.",
  ["2221202_13"]="Well, I'm not entirely sure what went down, but I guess I've grown accustomed to it.",
  ["2221202_14"]="It's up to the adults to settle disputes among the kids.",
  ["2221202_2"]="...Temporary takeover.",
  ["2221202_3"]="Why did Ere suddenly take charge of the training area? Why wasn't I informed?",
  ["2221202_4"]="Any idea, Shamash?",
  ["2221202_5"]="Shamash remains impassive, neither confirming nor denying, his gaze fixed downward in silence.",
  ["2221202_6"]="Below, the chaos within the training grounds continues. The scythe strikes become more intense, each attack sharp and unyielding, exuding an air of destruction—that is a rare sight for Ereshan to be in.",
  ["2221202_7"]="The answer becomes evident.",
  ["2221202_8"]="...",
  ["2221202_9"]="Fury.",
  ["2221203_1"]="Concluding another round of practice, Ereshan twirls her scythe and exits her combat stance.",
  ["2221203_10"]="Why don't you take a breather? Make some adjustments before we go at it.",
  ["2221203_11"]="Meanwhile, I'll warm up.",
  ["2221203_2"]="I was expecting you to come down and give me a lecture. How's the view up there?",
  ["2221203_3"]="Yeah, it's pretty sweet. You can see everything clearly from up on the field.",
  ["2221203_4"]="Nice work, Ere. Your footwork has improved a lot, and your reflexes are sharper.",
  ["2221203_5"]="Hah, isn't that to be expected from me?",
  ["2221203_6"]="But there's still plenty of room for improvement in your technique.",
  ["2221203_7"]="How about we spar a bit? Nothing like a simulated battle for training, right?",
  ["2221203_8"]="Hah, that would be a nice change. These dummies are starting to bore me.",
  ["2221203_9"]="Nanna nods at the enthusiastic Ereshan, her movements exuding a refined grace borne of rich experience.",
  ["2221401_1"]="This must be the area.",
  ["2221401_2"]="*Cough* Can't believe there's so much dust here.",
  ["2221401_3"]="Nanna glances at the old bookshelves, where parchments lie coated in a thick layer of dust.",
  ["2221401_4"]="There are quite a few ancient manuscripts stored here. Let's go find them.",
  ["2221403_1"]="As Nanna approaches the bookshelf, the stone floor beneath her suddenly trembles, catching Nanna off guard as she falls unexpectedly.",
  ["2221403_10"]="Looks like it's just a secret chamber...",
  ["2221403_11"]="These puzzles... were they really designed to protect those manuscripts?",
  ["2221403_12"]="...",
  ["2221403_13"]="I'm sorry, Nanna, for getting you involved.",
  ["2221403_14"]="Hmmm? Hey, no worries. Even secret chambers must have an exit. Let's search for it together.",
  ["2221403_15"]="Stick close to me, okay, Ninsar?",
  ["2221403_2"]="Upon reopening her eyes, Nanna finds herself and Ninsar in an unfamiliar room. Dimly lit, the room's surroundings are barely discernible.",
  ["2221403_3"]="*Cough* *Cough*",
  ["2221403_4"]="Are you alright, Ninsar?",
  ["2221403_5"]="I'm fine, just stumbled and it stings a bit.",
  ["2221403_6"]="Phew, good to know.",
  ["2221403_7"]="Seems like I accidentally triggered some secret mechanism that opened this hidden passage and brought us here.",
  ["2221403_8"]="This is weird. What exactly is this place...? A secret chamber from ancient times?",
  ["2221403_9"]="Within the enclosed space, only Nanna's question echoes, reverberating through the silence, with no answers or exits revealed.",
  ["2221404_1"]="Just as I suspected, solving the puzzle shows us the way out.",
  ["2221404_2"]="Hmm, we can move on now.",
  ["2221405_1"]="Perfect, it worked out.",
  ["2221405_2"]="It's so dark in here... How many rooms are there?",
  ["2221405_3"]="Let's get out of here quickly.",
  ["2221406_1"]="Made a mistake? No worries. Let's head back to the central console and restart the mechanism.",
  ["2221406_2"]="Remember the sequence in which the lights flash and reactivate them in the same order.",
  ["2221407_1"]="The bookshelves lining both sides are disarrayed with assorted books. Nanna can't help but frown at this sight.",
  ["2221407_2"]="Check out the inside of these bookshelves. They seem to show the right order.",
  ["2221407_3"]="Yep, let's rearrange them accordingly.",
  ["2221408_1"]="With the last book returned to its rightful place, a low rumble emanates from a corner of the chamber, revealing a secret door.",
  ["2221408_2"]="I wonder who would set up traps like this? It somehow reminds me of someone...",
  ["2221408_3"]="What's on your mind, Nanna?",
  ["2221408_4"]="Oh, nothing much. Just thinking about some careless librarian who always leaves books strewn about after reading.",
  ["2221408_5"]="Okay, let's keep moving. Maybe the way out is just around the corner.",
  ["2221409_1"]="Nanna and Ninsar proceed through the dimly lit passageway, only to be greeted with another chamber instead of an exit.",
  ["2221409_2"]="...",
  ["2221409_3"]="Alright, more puzzles to tackle...",
  ["2221409_4"]="There must be hidden mechanisms in this room too. Let's search for them.",
  ["2221410_1"]="I can't quite recall the patterns. Should I restart the mechanism?",
  ["2221410_2"]="Yes.",
  ["2221410_3"]="No.",
  ["2222201_1"]="Looking for a mountain spring? Just follow that path over there, and you'll find it on the mountainside.",
  ["2222201_2"]="Be careful not to go too far. Someone your age could get into trouble if you wander off too much.",
  ["2222201_3"]="What kind of trouble?",
  ["2222201_4"]="That's where the Tianli Clan resides, and they aren't too keen on unexpected guests dropping by.",
  ["2222201_5"]="I see. Thank you.",
  ["2222202_1"]="Have you heard about the ruckus up in the back of the mountain?",
  ["2222202_2"]="Yeah, I caught a glimpse of those folks being carried out from there. They looked pretty badly hurt.",
  ["2222202_3"]="The news says they were attacked by a feral beast... Let's hope it doesn't make its way into the city.",
  ["2222202_4"]="Oh, come on, it's just a beast. They usually steer clear of crowded areas.",
  ["2222202_5"]="(...So, there's a beast lurking around the back of the mountain? I should keep an eye out and finish up my work quickly.)",
  ["2222203_1"]="Hello, I'm a student here, and I'm looking to do some sketches.",
  ["2222203_2"]="Are there any streams around here in the mountains?",
  ["2222203_3"]="If you follow the mountain trail out, you'll spot a couple of springs, but things have been a bit unsettled up there lately.",
  ["2222203_4"]="This morning, I heard roars from the back of the mountain.",
  ["2222203_5"]="Maybe you should think about painting something else within the city.",
  ["2222203_6"]="Thanks for the heads-up.",
  ["2222204_1"]="Sorry, but I'm just a tourist here too.",
  ["2222204_2"]="I see. Thanks anyway.",
  ["2222205_1"]="I've got a general idea of what went down there.",
  ["2222205_2"]="Time to head out.",
  ["2222207_1"]="Relying on his instincts, Wushi deftly sidesteps the snake that emerges from the grass.",
  ["2222207_10"]="But I've got to rescue them. Let's focus on that for now.",
  ["2222207_11"]="I should head straight for the people calling for help and try to ignore the beasts on the way.",
  ["2222207_2"]="His swing, however, fails to hit its target. The green snake wriggles away and disappears into the undergrowth.",
  ["2222207_3"]="Is the snake running away?",
  ["2222207_4"]="What could be lurking in that forest?",
  ["2222207_5"]="Firming his grip on the blades, Wushi observes several frightened animals swiftly passing by him from the rear.",
  ["2222207_6"]="A sudden gust of wind arises, prompting a flock of startled birds to flee from the woods.",
  ["2222207_7"]="Help! Anyone these? Help!",
  ["2222207_8"]="A cry for help? Coming from deep within the woods?",
  ["2222207_9"]="Even with some swordplay tips from the Master, dealing with those beasts won't be a walk in the park.",
  ["2222208_1"]="Are you alright?",
  ["2222208_2"]="*Cough* Thank you...",
  ["2222208_3"]="There are still others trapped inside.",
  ["2222208_4"]="Got it.",
  ["2222208_5"]="...You must be careful.",
  ["2222208_6"]="The resident, visibly exerting himself, gestures towards the courtyard, displaying blood-soaked attire and deep claw marks engraved on his skin.",
  ["2222208_7"]="The view of the injuries is striking, hinting at a hidden creature behind the courtyard door, baring its lethal teeth.",
  ["2222209_1"]="Seizing the opportunity, Wushi leaps forward, executing a practiced maneuver targeting the giant bear's neck.",
  ["2222209_10"]="If I can defeat the beast, even if it costs me my life...",
  ["2222209_11"]="Enduring the pain in his right leg, Wushi stands up, preparing for a dire struggle.",
  ["2222209_12"]="Stand back.",
  ["2222209_13"]="A resounding voice reverberates from behind Wushi, drowning out the bear's impending roar. Startled, the bear promptly withdraws and disappears into the forest.",
  ["2222209_14"]="Struggling to maintain focus, Wushi staggers as a mysterious greenish figure approaches.",
  ["2222209_15"]="Master...",
  ["2222209_16"]="Don't speak. You're seriously injured.",
  ["2222209_17"]="But... those Tianli people over there...",
  ["2222209_18"]="Rest now. I'll take care of the rest.",
  ["2222209_19"]="Wushi falls silent, exhaustion from the fierce battle overwhelming him, his vision fading into blankness.",
  ["2222209_2"]="Perhaps accustomed to untamed rampages in the forest, the giant bear fails to foresee the sudden attack from the young man.",
  ["2222209_3"]="It snarls, promptly exerting pressure on its neck in an effort to dislodge Wushi.",
  ["2222209_4"]="The bear's robust muscles grip his blade firmly. Despite the precise strike, the beast's thick hide shields its vital area. The attack further agitates the bear, leading it to forcefully hurl Wushi away.",
  ["2222209_5"]="Ugh...",
  ["2222209_6"]="Dazed from the blow, Wushi attempts to regain his footing. Fortunately, the blades, fallen amidst the chaos, lie at his feet, and the hostile bear does not seize the chance to lunge and end his life.",
  ["2222209_7"]="Attracted by the scent of blood, the bear cautiously retreats towards the injured Tianli resident while keeping an eye on Wushi.",
  ["2222209_8"]="Why is this happening again...?",
  ["2222209_9"]="How much longer do I have to deal with my own incompetence?",
  ["2222210_1"]="!",
  ["2222210_2"]="Before him stands a massive bear looming over its potential victim, poised to crush its prey's head. Had Wushi delayed even slightly, the Tianli resident would have met his end.",
  ["2222210_3"]="Surprised by Wushi's abrupt presence, the beast regards him with evident irritation.",
  ["2222210_4"]="Only ten paces separate the young man from the menacing beast.",
  ["2222210_5"]="Standing at such proximity, the oppressive aura of the beast exceeds his expectations.",
  ["2222210_6"]="Can I really take down such a formidable opponent?",
  ["2222210_7"]="Reflecting on his actions, he realizes that retreat is no longer an option, especially with the fate of the Tianli resident at stake.",
  ["2222210_8"]="Unexpectedly, the feral bear does not attack but lowers its head, ready to enjoy its prey.",
  ["2222210_9"]="...A great chance.",
  ["2222301_1"]="Following the master towards the inner courtyard, Wushi notices several rows of wooden dummies meticulously arranged.",
  ["2222301_2"]="What's this... Master?",
  ["2222301_3"]="It's a device created by ancient people to defend against invaders. I saw it in QingYu City and decided to make a few replicas on a whim.",
  ["2222301_4"]="Even though it's just a dummy, its mechanisms make it a challenging opponent. It could be helpful for your training.",
  ["2222301_5"]="...",
  ["2222302_1"]="The dummy before him appears ordinary, akin to the scarecrows widely seen in the Western Region.",
  ["2222302_10"]="To truly improve your skills, you should focus on footwork and your mindset. Let's start by dodging the wooden bolts from the dummy for now.",
  ["2222302_2"]="Without hesitation, Wushi draws his blades and launches strikes with full force...",
  ["2222302_3"]="!",
  ["2222302_4"]="However, as he approaches, the dummy undergoes a sudden transformation and executes a swing attack. Wushi narrowly evades the stick extended by the dummy but gets by a wooden bolt to the chest, causing him to stagger for recovery.",
  ["2222302_5"]="As he attempts to strike once more, the dummy transforms once more and releases multiple wooden bolts from various locations, causing intense pain upon his body. Frustrated, Wushi attempts to launch another attack but is stopped by the master.",
  ["2222302_6"]="I didn't explain all the intricacies to you, and I expected you might face some setbacks.",
  ["2222302_7"]="I've been observing your techniques, and I've noticed you rely heavily on sheer strength in your swordplay.",
  ["2222302_8"]="Using blades in that manner can be extremely risky.",
  ["2222302_9"]="Exerting too much force may break the edge... I'm not only talking about your blades, but also about yourself.",
  ["2222303_1"]="How have things been going? Been a bit of a challenge, hasn't it?",
  ["2222303_10"]="Yes, Master!",
  ["2222303_2"]="Exactly as you say, Master.",
  ["2222303_3"]="When Wushi finally strikes the dummy, he is all covered in bruises.",
  ["2222303_4"]="If this is already so tough, imagine dealing with multiple foes at once. That'd be a whole other level.",
  ["2222303_5"]="What's this... Master?",
  ["2222303_6"]="The master places another dummy in the training area.",
  ["2222303_7"]="No need to fret. Just raise the level a little bit more. Real combats can be far more complicated.",
  ["2222303_8"]="See if you can dodge those wooden bolts or use cover. It's all about refining your footwork.",
  ["2222303_9"]="Let's give it another shot.",
  ["2222304_1"]="Focus on evasion. Don't rush into battle recklessly.",
  ["2222305_1"]="Steady your mind. Observation is the key.",
  ["2222402_1"]="Picture this: you're walking on a narrow mountain path when suddenly an ape leaps out, swinging through the vines to attack you. How would you handle that scenario?",
  ["2222402_2"]="Even a martial arts expert would struggle on a narrow path...",
  ["2222402_3"]="Especially if the agile ape can move effortlessly through the vines. In that situation, I wouldn't approach it with just my blades...",
  ["2222402_4"]="I shouldn't rush into a confrontation with the ape. Instead, I'd seize the opportunity to cut the vines it's using to my advantage.",
  ["2222402_5"]="...Well, show me how it's done.",
  ["2222402_6"]="Yeah.",
  ["2222403_1"]="With his swift movements, the ape in his imagination is cornered and then fades out in a faint cerulean mist.",
  ["2222403_2"]="Could you give me some feedback, Master?",
  ["2222403_3"]="No need to hurry. You handled the situation with the ape on the narrow path well, but real scenarios can throw unexpected challenges your way.",
  ["2222403_4"]="Let's try this: picture yourself about to cross a river when a giant tortoise emerges, feeding in the rapids.",
  ["2222403_5"]="The tortoise's shell is tough as rock. How would you get rid of it?",
  ["2222403_6"]="...",
  ["2222403_7"]="The tortoise might have a sturdy shell, but it moves slowly.",
  ["2222403_8"]="With twin blades, agility is my strength. So, I'd rely on my speed to outmaneuver the tortoise.",
  ["2222403_9"]="Before the master nods, Wushi lunges forward, driving both knives into the giant tortoise in his imagination.",
  ["2222404_1"]="The blades dance rapidly, casting fleeting shadows along with Wushi's footwork.",
  ["2222404_10"]="Snakes are cunning. A hasty strike could leave me vulnerable to a counterattack...",
  ["2222404_11"]="But when a snake strikes, its body bounces towards the target. If I can anticipate its movement, I could strike it down cleanly.",
  ["2222404_2"]="Swiftly pivoting, he suddenly turns around and delivers a fatal blow.",
  ["2222404_3"]="Once he notices an opening in the opponent's defense, he will show no mercy.",
  ["2222404_4"]="Turning around, he sees his master gazing thoughtfully at him without uttering a word.",
  ["2222404_5"]="Master?",
  ["2222404_6"]="Please let me know if you notice any flaws in my technique, Master.",
  ["2222404_7"]="Well, your technique itself is flawless... Don't worry, let's move on to the next challenge.",
  ["2222404_8"]="Now, imagine walking through tall grass when you suddenly hear a rustle behind you...",
  ["2222404_9"]="...A rustle in tall grass likely means a snake.",
  ["2222501_1"]="The night sky is adorned with bright stars, ideal for hunting.",
  ["2222501_10"]="After several years, the feral bear has grown even larger, resembling a legendary ancient monster that once shook heavens.",
  ["2222501_11"]="Beneath the starlit sky, the bear sniffs the air, seemingly recognizing the adversary who once dealt it a severe blow.",
  ["2222501_12"]="A destined reunion between adversaries.",
  ["2222501_13"]="Accompanied by a thunderous roar reverberating through the forest, the colossal figure leaps from the woods, descending towards him.",
  ["2222501_2"]="A nimble figure navigates the forest, concealed amidst the dense foliage, his twin blades shimmering like cold stars.",
  ["2222501_3"]="Where is it...?",
  ["2222501_4"]="Locating a specific beast in the forest is no easy feat, especially at night.",
  ["2222501_5"]="However, he has already promised to the master that he will eradicate the bear once and for all...",
  ["2222501_6"]="Driven by a strong intuition, he alters his direction.",
  ["2222501_7"]="The stream, the towering trees, and the rugged rocks... It feels like what happened back then.",
  ["2222501_8"]="Perhaps drawn by human scents or the intentional noises produced by Wushi...",
  ["2222501_9"]="In the dense forest, a pair of ominous red eyes draw nearer.",
  ["2223101_1"]="Soon after Zero and I arrived in CangLin City, one evening, Xin calls us out.",
  ["2223101_10"]="I got a report that someone went missing this morning.",
  ["2223101_11"]="Qing was worried and didn't want me to search alone. Since no one else was available, I thought of you...",
  ["2223101_12"]="You're not busy as they are, are you?",
  ["2223101_13"]="You're not busy as they are, are you?",
  ["2223101_14"]="Well, I'm free right now.",
  ["2223101_15"]="I'm pretty tied up, but since I'm already here...",
  ["2223101_16"]="I knew you'd have a lot of time!",
  ["2223101_17"]="Let's get going, then!",
  ["2223101_18"]="...",
  ["2223101_19"]="...",
  ["2223101_2"]="\"To ensure everyone's safety, a curfew will be enforced in CangLin City after seven in the evening. Please stay at your home and don't go out...\"",
  ["2223101_20"]="What's with the hesitation...?",
  ["2223101_21"]="Do me this favor, and I'll treat you to dinner once we're done with this!",
  ["2223101_22"]="Deal.",
  ["2223101_23"]="Even if it's not quite curfew yet, who'd stick around in the dark at this hour?!",
  ["2223101_24"]="Do we have any other leads?",
  ["2223101_25"]="According to Qing, this is the place most frequented by the missing man, and she has spotted him around here before.",
  ["2223101_26"]="This place has been a ghost town since this afternoon, so anyone with sense wouldn't be here, I reckon.",
  ["2223101_27"]="As for other clues... I'm not entirely sure. It doesn't seem urgent since he's just been missing for just one day, but I'm worried he might be in trouble...",
  ["2223101_28"]="Anyway, it's too dark here. Let's turn on the lights first!",
  ["2223101_3"]="The curfew announcement I heard earlier in the day continues to play in the distance.",
  ["2223101_4"]="I glance at Zero.",
  ["2223101_5"]="By Qian's time, it's already eight in the evening.",
  ["2223101_6"]="I look over at Xin.",
  ["2223101_7"]="What's with that expression?",
  ["2223101_8"]="Aren't they enforcing a curfew now?",
  ["2223101_9"]="Why did you call us out?",
  ["2223102_1"]="Wait.",
  ["2223102_2"]="What's wrong?",
  ["2223102_3"]="Turning on the lights will draw in insects.",
  ["2223102_4"]="Bring it on. I'm ready to fight them!",
  ["2223104_1"]="Ah! Who flicked on the lights?!",
  ["2223104_10"]="How long have you been at it?",
  ["2223104_11"]="I didn't even realize. I just know I got here before the crack of dawn...",
  ["2223104_12"]="His basket is empty.",
  ["2223104_13"]="...",
  ["2223104_14"]="You haven't snagged a single fish yet, have you?",
  ["2223104_15"]="...",
  ["2223104_16"]="...",
  ["2223104_17"]="Something's gone wrong...",
  ["2223104_18"]="Could it be the weather? The water? The bait? The rod? Something's off somewhere...",
  ["2223104_19"]="None of those factors should stop the fish from biting.",
  ["2223104_2"]="Hey, it's curfew now! Why are you out here instead of staying at home?",
  ["2223104_20"]="...",
  ["2223104_21"]="Obviously, Zero's words take toll on him.",
  ["2223104_22"]="Zero, that's a bit too harsh.",
  ["2223104_23"]="Sorry, Zero didn't say that on purpose.",
  ["2223104_24"]="...",
  ["2223104_25"]="Enough with the chitchat. Watch out, insects are swarming.",
  ["2223104_26"]="I know, but that makes it sting more...",
  ["2223104_27"]="Enough with the chitchat. Watch out, insects are swarming.",
  ["2223104_3"]="Hmm...",
  ["2223104_4"]="My family had a sudden craving for fish, so I...",
  ["2223104_5"]="So you're here fishing?",
  ["2223104_6"]="Well...",
  ["2223104_7"]="Why not just buy fish instead?",
  ["2223104_8"]="No way! I'm a seasoned fisherman. How can I not show off my skills and reel in a big one when my family wants it?!",
  ["2223104_9"]="It's late, and you're still here...",
  ["2223105_1"]="Whoa! Why are these bugs so aggressive?!",
  ["2223105_10"]="Nooooo! Please, no!",
  ["2223105_11"]="Hey, you've trespassed into the quarantine zone and got caught! Brace yourself for the consequences!",
  ["2223105_12"]="What quarantine zone? I was here early this morning, and this place wasn't cordoned off at all!",
  ["2223105_13"]="Huh? Oh... right, the blockade started this afternoon.",
  ["2223105_14"]="But even if I knew it was going to be blocked off, I would have come anyway.",
  ["2223105_15"]="Huh?",
  ["2223105_16"]="Because I don't have a clue about any other fishing spots...",
  ["2223105_17"]="But you're a seasoned fisherman...",
  ["2223105_18"]="Please, cut it out!",
  ["2223105_19"]="...",
  ["2223105_2"]="Why didn't you just stay home and spare yourself all this hassle?!",
  ["2223105_20"]="Just come up with an excuse, like saying he got lost.",
  ["2223105_21"]="Getting lost? But that's a bit too...",
  ["2223105_22"]="Please, let's just say I got lost. I really don't want anyone to know I spent the whole day without catching anything.",
  ["2223105_23"]="He gazes at Xin with grim determination and seriousness.",
  ["2223105_24"]="That's some resolve.",
  ["2223105_25"]="Alright, if that's what you really want, I can write it that way...",
  ["2223105_26"]="Ugh, this is so frustrating.",
  ["2223105_27"]="All this noise must have scared off the fish. They probably won't bite now.",
  ["2223105_28"]="Almost immediately, he comes up with another excuse for his failure to catch fish.",
  ["2223105_29"]="Just to confirm, you're not going to mention that in your report, right?",
  ["2223105_3"]="Seriously, if you had stayed home...",
  ["2223105_30"]="No, I won't! Just go home already!",
  ["2223105_31"]="After confirming this with Xin multiple times and receiving reassurances, he eventually heads home.",
  ["2223105_32"]="Observing his frustrated demeanor, Zero appears perplexed.",
  ["2223105_33"]="Why is he so fixated on the outcome?",
  ["2223105_34"]="That's probably a common trait among fishing enthusiasts.",
  ["2223105_35"]="I see...",
  ["2223105_36"]="Hopefully, once the crisis in CangLin City is resolved, he will succeed in fishing.",
  ["2223105_4"]="No one would have known you came up empty on the fishing front.",
  ["2223105_5"]="...",
  ["2223105_6"]="Well, at least I'll know what to put in the report now.",
  ["2223105_7"]="What? You're going to note down that I couldn't catch a single fish all day?!",
  ["2223105_8"]="Yeah, of course. I'm out searching for you, so I'll need to detail everything.",
  ["2223105_9"]="\"The reason for his disappearance: fixated on fishing but didn't catch anything, leading to a late homecoming.\" That should be just fine, right?",
  ["2224101_12"]="Xin looked a little uncomfortable after hearing my honest apology.",
  ["2224101_13"]="I-I wasn't mad at you or anything! I mean, I'm the one who needs your help... Wait, are you messing with me?",
  ["2224101_14"]="Heh, of course! No one in all of WeiShi can outrun me.",
  ["2224101_15"]="Anyway, enough chit-chat. I actually called you here because of... you know what.",
  ["2224101_16"]="You know, that thing we always do after a big win.",
  ["2224101_17"]="What phenomenon?",
  ["2224101_18"]="What is it?",
  ["2224101_2"]="After I got back to CangLin City from QingYu, life finally slowed down. I took some time to rest and recover, while the city around me was slowly getting back on its feet. Just taking a walk through the streets, it was easy to see how much everything had changed.",
  ["2224101_21"]="Geez, how can you be so clueless?",
  ["2224101_22"]="Sleep?",
  ["2224101_23"]="Rest?",
  ["2224101_24"]="Eat?",
  ["2224101_28"]="Of course not! It's a victory party! Gotta lavishing ourselves to some amazing food and celebrate the win!",
  ["2224101_29"]="Hey, who do you think you're talking to? I practice a hundred words every single day!",
  ["2224101_3"]="Before I left the city, Xin reached out and asked to meet up. It sounded like she needed a favor, but since she's terrible at explaining things over the comms, I had no idea what it was about.",
  ["2224101_30"]="I'm impressed you even know a fancy word like \"lavishing\".",
  ["2224101_31"]="...",
  ["2224101_32"]="No wonder I spotted a grill on my way here.",
  ["2224101_36"]="Ahem, anyway, I'm planning a surprise party for Qing and the others. But I can't do it all by myself, so I called you in to help.",
  ["2224101_37"]="Ugh, you're such a pain... Fine, I did get something else ready just for you. Happy now?",
  ["2224101_38"]="Hey, how come I don't get a surprise too?",
  ["2224101_39"]="Alright, I'm in.",
  ["2224101_4"]="Finally, you're here! I've been waiting forever!",
  ["2224101_42"]="I'll take that as a yes. So, here's the deal: the morning market's already open. I need you to go grab some fresh ingredients. Here's the shopping list.",
  ["2224101_43"]="Yay!",
  ["2224101_44"]="That's fine I guess.",
  ["2224101_45"]="Thank you.",
  ["2224101_49"]="Xin handed me a piece of paper. As always, she preferred sketching things out with doodles instead of using actual words.",
  ["2224101_5"]="Uh, fair enough. If I keep \"taking shortcuts\" like that, the Bureau of Civil Security's gonna have a word with me.",
  ["2224101_50"]="Her drawings were messy, like a kid's, but surprisingly vivid. I could make out images of the ingredients: syrups, durians, and mooncakes.",
  ["2224101_51"]="What, got a problem with it? You just don't appreciate the genius behind my gourmet picks!",
  ["2224101_52"]="...",
  ["2224101_53"]="This feels off...",
  ["2224101_54"]="Are these even food for a carbon based lifeforms?",
  ["2224101_58"]="Alright, enough talk. I'm heading to the East Market. You go check out the West Market!",
  ["2224101_6"]="Well, not everyone can leap across rooftops like you.",
  ["2224101_60"]="Without another word, Xin spun around and took off like a whirlwind, just like she always does.",
  ["2224101_7"]="Sorry about that.",
  ["2224101_8"]="Maybe you're just way too fast.",
  ["2224102_10"]="A friend? Sounds more like you're trying to end the friendship!",
  ["2224102_11"]="A friend...?",
  ["2224102_14"]="...",
  ["2224102_15"]="(A wave of quiet despair washes over me.)",
  ["2224102_2"]="Fresh syrup for sale! Come get your sweet, sweet syrup!",
  ["2224102_3"]="Sure thing, just a moment!",
  ["2224102_4"]="Hey.",
  ["2224102_5"]="Two bowls of syrup, please.",
  ["2224102_8"]="It suddenly hit me that Qian's food culture is so diverse and rich that there might be dishes that use syrup as an ingredient. My curiosity got the best of me, so I decided to ask the vendor.",
  ["2224102_9"]="Syrup... for barbecue? Who are you even planning to cook that for?",
  ["2224103_11"]="...",
  ["2224103_12"]="I guess I wouldn't mind giving it a shot.",
  ["2224103_13"]="This stuff is totally my thing.",
  ["2224103_2"]="The box was packed with fresh durians, and their intense smell hit me like a wall. For a second, I could barely catch my breath.",
  ["2224103_3"]="Hey, want some durians? I just got a fresh batch in this morning. They're super fresh!",
  ["2224103_4"]="After thinking it over for a second, I asked the vendor if there were any dishes that used durian.",
  ["2224103_5"]="I'll take two.",
  ["2224103_6"]="Mind cutting them open for me?",
  ["2224103_9"]="Yeah, there are a few. Dishes like durian chicken are made from durian, but honestly, they're pretty rare. Gotta hand it to you, though, you've got a bold palate, my friend.",
  ["2224104_10"]="Nope, I'm using them for cooking.",
  ["2224104_14"]="...",
  ["2224104_15"]="(Looks away.)",
  ["2224104_16"]="(Darn it, this is all Xin's fault. Now people think I am weirdo too!)",
  ["2224104_2"]="Mooncake stalls lined both sides of the street, with every flavor you could think of. It was a dazzling sight... but in all seriousness, aren't mooncakes just meant to be eaten as they are? How are you even supposed to cook with them?",
  ["2224104_3"]="I'll take two boxes of mooncakes.",
  ["2224104_4"]="No nuts filling, please.",
  ["2224104_7"]="Are you getting these as a gift? Want a nice gift box to go with them?",
  ["2224104_8"]="...?",
  ["2224104_9"]="No.",
  ["2224105_10"]="Alright, I'm coming.",
  ["2224105_2"]="After picking up the ingredients Xin asked for, I was about to head back to the park when I suddenly got a call from her.",
  ["2224105_3"]="Hey, hey, hey! You won't believe what just happened!",
  ["2224105_4"]="I was on my way back when out of nowhere, this huge flock of birds swooped in and tried to steal the ingredients! There are way too many of them, I can't hold them off by myself! Get over here, quick!",
  ["2224105_5"]="On the other end of the line, there's a lot of noise, probably the sound of bird wings flapping, mixed with Xin's angry yelling. It's total chaos.",
  ["2224105_6"]="Hey! Quit yanking! My bag's about to rip!",
  ["2224105_8"]="Hmm...",
  ["2224105_9"]="Hold on!",
  ["2224106_2"]="I'm heading back to turn off the stove. You've got to get the ingredients back!",
  ["2224106_3"]="She blurted those words out, then took off. I guess I've gotten used to cleaning up other people's messes.",
  ["2224106_4"]="——Time to wrap this up quickly.",
  ["2224107_2"]="I shooed the birds away. They dropped the bags and flapped off in a frenzy, leaving the ingredients scattered all over the ground, but I managed to gather everything back up.",
  ["2224107_3"]="I took a closer look and saw the bag was packed with chilies, lemons, bitter melon, braised meats... What on earth is she planning to make with all this?",
  ["2224107_4"]="Fine.",
  ["2224107_5"]="I guess I won't be eating today.",
  ["2224107_6"]="Keeping an eye out for any more bird attacks, I hurried back to the park to hand the ingredients over to Xin.",
  ["2224108_1"]="You're back! Perfect timing, I was just about to start cooking!",
  ["2224108_3"]="(I'd really rather not get involved in this.)",
  ["2224108_4"]="Well, let's see what monstrosity you whip up.",
  ["2224109_11"]="Not long after, Xin called out that the food was ready and asked me to start handing it out. Seeing all the colorful dishes was enough to give me a headache. I wasn't sure if it was because those birds had pecked me silly earlier, but... it smelled kind of good?",
  ["2224109_12"]="What's with that look? Just take a bite, you'll see! It's really good!",
  ["2224109_14"]="No thanks...",
  ["2224109_15"]="A real delicacy this is...",
  ["2224109_16"]="Maybe we should let everyone eat first.",
  ["2224109_2"]="Everyone was already at the picnic spot when I got there. I handed the ingredients to Xin, and she jumped right into cooking mode. Say whatever you want about the flavors, but she sure knew how to move fast.",
  ["2224109_3"]="As we waited, my gaze drifted over to Qing.",
  ["2224109_4"]="It's all good, Xin already submitted a request beforehand. Everything's all squared away.",
  ["2224109_5"]="We are really barbecuing in the park...",
  ["2224109_6"]="Is this really okay?",
  ["2224109_7"]="The Bureau of Civil Security won't be angry about this, right?",
  ["2224110_12"]="Mmmf, mmmf...",
  ["2224110_13"]="Ming's expression turned into this weird mix of surprise and reluctant acceptance.",
  ["2224110_14"]="Can't believe I'm saying this, but it's actually not bad. The sweetness blends well with the braised flavor and tones down the saltiness.",
  ["2224110_15"]="The meat isn't as juicy after it was roasted again, but the flavor's stronger now, and it has a nice chew to it.",
  ["2224110_16"]=".....Can I have some more?",
  ["2224110_17"]="I gave Ming a portion of the spicy grilled durian. The grilling had mellowed out some of the durian's intense smell and brought out its sweetness, but the air was still thick with the sharp kick of chili. Bright red chopped chilies were sprinkled over the pale yellow flesh, and surprisingly, it didn't look half bad.",
  ["2224110_18"]="Well...",
  ["2224110_19"]="Steeling herself, Ming reluctantly took the dish with shaky hands and had a small bite.",
  ["2224110_2"]="...",
  ["2224110_20"]="In the next moment, she grabbed a water bottle and started chugging, desperately trying to wash away the awful taste in her mouth.",
  ["2224110_21"]="This is a disaster... I've always hated durian, and now with the chili, the taste is even worse...",
  ["2224110_22"]="Ugh... I've had enough. Can we please be done with this?",
  ["2224110_23"]="Well, you've definitely given it your best, Ming.",
  ["2224110_24"]="I gave Ming a piece of lemon mooncake, which honestly looked the most normal out of everything. Xin had crushed the mooncakes into powder, mixed it with lemon juice and pulp, then pressed it all back into a cake. It... probably won't be that bad, right?",
  ["2224110_25"]="Let me give it a shot...",
  ["2224110_26"]="Hmm... not bad, I guess. The lemon really tones down the mooncake's sweetness. But it's not really my thing. I'm not big on sweet stuff.",
  ["2224110_27"]="You can give this to Azi. She'll probably like it.",
  ["2224110_3"]="I could see the reluctance on Ming's face, but with Xin standing right there, she couldn't exactly turn it down.",
  ["2224110_4"]="Come on, it is what it is. Just give Ming a portion of the food.",
  ["2224110_5"]="I gave Ming a portion of the syrup-braised platter. It was basically just regular braised meat, covered in sugar syrup, then roasted again until a thin, sugary glaze formed on top.",
  ["2224110_6"]="Try the syrup braised platter.",
  ["2224110_7"]="Try the spicy grilled durian.",
  ["2224110_8"]="Try the lemon mooncake.",
  ["2224111_12"]="I've gotta hand it to you, it takes some serious imagination to mix these together.....",
  ["2224111_13"]="Azi squeezed her eyes shut and nervously took a bite.",
  ["2224111_14"]="Mmm... okay, not as bad as I thought. Kinda weird though...",
  ["2224111_15"]="Personally, I'd still go for some good old braised meat any day, but hey, gotta give you props for creativity. If you posted this online, it'd probably cause a huge buzz.",
  ["2224111_16"]="Just tell me if it's good or not, okay?\"",
  ["2224111_17"]="Maybe I should just ask the internet for their opinion?",
  ["2224111_18"]="I gave Azi a piece of lemon mooncake, which honestly looked the most normal out of everything. Xin had crushed the mooncakes into powder, mixed it with lemon juice and pulp, then pressed it all back into a cake. It... probably won't be that bad, right?",
  ["2224111_19"]="Oh wow, finally something that actually looks halfway decent, but why does it look so unappetizing?",
  ["2224111_2"]="I heard there was a celebration, so I showed up, but why is Xin the one cooking?",
  ["2224111_20"]="Let's see... lemon, mooncake... not bad. The lemon really cuts through the sweetness. I'd say it's passable!",
  ["2224111_21"]="Honestly, if you just spread this blob on some yogurt, threw on a few fruits, and posted it online, it might actually go viral.",
  ["2224111_22"]="Yogurt and fruit... got it! Heh, I told you my food tastes good, didn't I?",
  ["2224111_23"]="I gave Azi a bowl of the bitter melon chicken soup. It's got bitter melon and a bunch of medicinal herbs in it, but honestly, unless you're a hardcore health nut, I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying something this bitter.",
  ["2224111_24"]="Ugh... Do I really have to drink this? It smells just like the Condensed Poison we use in the Tang Sect!",
  ["2224111_25"]="What are you even talking about? This is bitter melon chicken! It's really nutritious!",
  ["2224111_26"]="Holding her nose like it was the worst thing she'd ever have to do, Azi braced herself and took a sip.",
  ["2224111_27"]="...",
  ["2224111_28"]="Azi collapsed!",
  ["2224111_3"]="What's wrong with that? I make really tasty food!",
  ["2224111_4"]="Xin strong-armed Azi into trying the food, and now it's time to pick a dish.",
  ["2224111_5"]="I gave Azi a portion of the syrup-braised platter. It was basically just regular braised meat, covered in sugar syrup, then roasted again until a thin, sugary glaze formed on top.",
  ["2224111_6"]="Try the syrup braised platter.",
  ["2224111_7"]="Try the lemon mooncake.",
  ["2224111_8"]="Try the bitter melon chicken.",
  ["2224112_12"]="Ah... this one.",
  ["2224112_13"]="Qing doesn't look like it's her first time eating this. Without hesitating, she took a bite.",
  ["2224112_14"]="It's a little too sweet for me. I'd need some strong tea to go with it.",
  ["2224112_15"]="I gave Qing a bowl of the bitter melon chicken soup. It's got bitter melon and a bunch of medicinal herbs in it, but honestly, unless you're a hardcore health nut, I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying something this bitter.",
  ["2224112_16"]="Qing chugged down the soup without even hesitating.",
  ["2224112_17"]="It's actually pretty good. The bitter melon and herbs kinda balance things out, plus they've got some health benefits.",
  ["2224112_18"]="I have to admit, I'm impressed with Qing's taste buds.",
  ["2224112_19"]="I gave Qing a portion of the spicy grilled durian. The grilling had mellowed out some of the durian's intense smell and brought out its sweetness, but the air was still thick with the sharp kick of chili. Bright red chopped chilies were sprinkled over the pale yellow flesh, and surprisingly, it didn't look half bad.",
  ["2224112_2"]="Qing hardly ever gets a break, and yet here she is, stuck at this ridiculous victory party. But she's handling it all like a pro, staying calm and composed.",
  ["2224112_20"]="To my surprise, Qing gave a nostalgic smile as soon as she saw it.",
  ["2224112_21"]="This was the first dish Xin made after moving to CangLin City. I'm not usually into sweet stuff, but the mix of chili and fruit flavors actually turned out pretty great.",
  ["2224112_22"]="Before I knew it, Qing had already scarfed down half the plate. Guess she really likes this dish.",
  ["2224112_3"]="Back when I was living with Xin, she cooked for me a lot. Her dishes might've looked and smelled a little weird, but there was always something special about them. She really put her heart into it, too.",
  ["2224112_4"]="Well then, let's pick a dish for Qing to try.",
  ["2224112_5"]="I gave Qing a piece of lemon mooncake, which honestly looked the most normal out of everything. Xin had crushed the mooncakes into powder, mixed it with lemon juice and pulp, then pressed it all back into a cake. It... probably won't be that bad, right?",
  ["2224112_6"]="Try the lemon mooncake.",
  ["2224112_7"]="Try the bitter melon chicken.",
  ["2224112_8"]="Try the spicy grilled durian.",
  ["2224113_11"]="I gave Yuli a bowl of the bitter melon chicken soup. It's got bitter melon and a bunch of medicinal herbs in it, but honestly, unless you're a hardcore health nut, I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying something this bitter.",
  ["2224113_12"]="Try the bitter melon chicken.",
  ["2224113_13"]="Try the lemon mooncake.",
  ["2224113_14"]="Try the syrup braised platter.",
  ["2224113_18"]="Yuli took the soup without hesitation and sniffed it.",
  ["2224113_19"]="It smells great! Thanks, Head Librarian. Thanks, Xin.",
  ["2224113_2"]="Yuli stood in front of me, eagerly waiting for her share. She had no idea what kind of culinary disaster she was about to face.",
  ["2224113_20"]="Yuli slowly savored the soup, then looked up at me and asked if she could have another serving.",
  ["2224113_21"]="Huh?",
  ["2224113_22"]="Don't mention it.....",
  ["2224113_25"]="The ingredients are super fresh, and the herbs smell great too. I really like this.",
  ["2224113_26"]=".....As long as she's happy.",
  ["2224113_27"]="I gave Yuli a piece of lemon mooncake, which honestly looked the most normal out of everything. Xin had crushed the mooncakes into powder, mixed it with lemon juice and pulp, then pressed it all back into a cake. It... probably won't be that bad, right?",
  ["2224113_28"]="Yuli cut the mooncake into small pieces and happily ate them up.",
  ["2224113_29"]="This is really good! Head Librarian, do you want some too?",
  ["2224113_3"]="You've worked so hard, Head Librarian. Why don't you have some too?",
  ["2224113_30"]="Hmm... maybe later.",
  ["2224113_31"]="I gave Yuli a portion of the syrup-braised platter. It was basically just regular braised meat, covered in sugar syrup, then roasted again until a thin, sugary glaze formed on top.",
  ["2224113_32"]="Yuli politely took the dish and had a bite, but then her face scrunched up.",
  ["2224113_33"]="Um... the meat's not very fresh.",
  ["2224113_34"]="Yeah, that's a problem with some of the braised meat shops. They mask the meat's lack of freshness with heavy seasoning so customers can't tell. But Yuli's got a really sharp sense of taste.",
  ["2224113_35"]="Wasting food is terrible. I'll make sure to finish this.",
  ["2224113_4"]="Trying to avoid the topic, I quickly started picking out some food for Yuli.",
  ["2224113_5"]="Hmm...",
  ["2224113_6"]="I...",
  ["2224113_7"]="(Change the subject.)",
  ["2224114_2"]="The hot barbecue grill waits, ready for the chef to work his magic. Nearby, a pot of chicken soup simmers, filling the air with a savory aroma.",
  ["2224114_3"]="By the way, is barbecuing allowed in residential area parks? That seems a bit sketchy.",
  ["2224115_10"]="Glad to hear that. Next time, I'll teach you how to make your favorite dish!",
  ["2224115_11"]="I'm full.",
  ["2224115_12"]="I'm stuffed.",
  ["2224115_13"]="I'm still hungry.",
  ["2224115_17"]="You really love my cooking that much? Just hit me up whenever you're craving it!",
  ["2224115_18"]="Still hungry? No way, I'll whip something else up for you right now.",
  ["2224115_19"]="Hmm… How about spicy chocolate hot pot, fruit oat cakes, or creamy lemon chili pops? Which one do you want?",
  ["2224115_2"]="After trying all the dishes, everyone ended up finding something they liked. Nothing went to waste.",
  ["2224115_20"]="These are all my secret recipes. You've helped me so much, so I'm giving you my cookbook as a thank-you gift!",
  ["2224115_22"]="Thank you.",
  ["2224115_23"]="Uh...",
  ["2224115_24"]="One small step for Xin, a giant leap for the culinary world.",
  ["2224115_3"]="Phew, I'm stuffed... So, what do you think? My cooking's pretty good, right?",
  ["2224115_4"]="Hmm... how do I put this?",
  ["2224115_5"]="I'd say you could make it as a food blogger, but maybe more in the weird food niche.",
  ["2224115_6"]="Not bad. You've come a long way since a few years ago.",
  ["2224115_7"]="I… I actually liked everything! Thank you, Xin.",
  ["2224115_8"]="Looks like this celebration turned out to be quite a success after all?",
  ["2224115_9"]="So, what about you? Are you full?",
  ["2225101_1"]="At this moment, the Cerulean Water crisis has been resolved, and CangLin City has returned to its peaceful state.",
  ["2225101_10"]="CangLin City has plenty of wonderful attractions, and the Bureau of Culture & Tourism organizes various cultural events regularly. If you're interested, you're welcome to visit the government office for more information.",
  ["2225101_11"]="I appreciate the compliment, although I know there's always room for improvement.",
  ["2225101_12"]="We hold a calligraphy competition in this square from time to time, and all calligraphy enthusiasts from the neighborhood usually participate. I just finished up my paperwork and joined the event.",
  ["2225101_13"]="While Qing speaks, another calligrapher finishes his creation. It is the word \"Sheath,\" embodying both strength and flexibility, surpassing Qing's artwork even to the untrained eye.",
  ["2225101_14"]="The audience cheers for the newly crowned champion.",
  ["2225101_15"]="Alas, looks like I've lost again.",
  ["2225101_16"]="Well done, Secretary Qing. Let's have another match when you're free next time.",
  ["2225101_2"]="Since arriving in Qian, I have been dragged into a series of unexpected events and have not had the opportunity to begin my sightseeing tour.",
  ["2225101_3"]="At present, a group of individuals has gathered in the square, and Qing is among them. She wields a large brush almost as tall as her, gracefully inscribing the word \"Edge\" on the ground.",
  ["2225101_4"]="Although the water marks on the ground will soon evaporate, all onlookers applaud her exceptional calligraphy.",
  ["2225101_5"]="At that moment, Qing notices me and offers a rare, relaxed smile.",
  ["2225101_6"]="Taking a leisurely stroll, Head Librarian?",
  ["2225101_7"]="Yep, just here to enjoy the sights.",
  ["2225101_8"]="What brings you here today?",
  ["2225101_9"]="Your calligraphy is quite impressive.",
  ["2225102_1"]="Judging by Qing's expression, this may not be her first defeat in the competition, or perhaps she has faced numerous losses in these contests.",
  ["2225102_10"]="Do you need my help?",
  ["2225102_11"]="Head Librarian?",
  ["2225102_12"]="We've known each other for quite some time now.",
  ["2225102_13"]="You've done me many favors in the past.",
  ["2225102_14"]="Consider it a favor from a friend.",
  ["2225102_15"]="So, are we friends already? Yeah, I shouldn't keep my distance from you.",
  ["2225102_16"]="You're so kind, Head Librarian.",
  ["2225102_17"]="Friends? Well, I don't make friends easily due to my work, but you're one of the few I consider a friend, Head Librarian.",
  ["2225102_18"]="Thank you for your generosity. How do you plan to help me?",
  ["2225102_19"]="Seeking guidance from experts is a proven shortcut for learning.",
  ["2225102_2"]="Have you ever won before?",
  ["2225102_3"]="Did you lose often in the contest?",
  ["2225102_4"]="I believe you deserve to claim the top spot.",
  ["2225102_5"]="I haven't quite refined my skills enough to secure a victory yet. Although others say my technique is flawless, there's a certain subtlety missing in my artistic vision.",
  ["2225102_6"]="Saying \"I often lose\" would be an understatement. The truth is, I've never won once. Although others say my technique is flawless, there's a certain subtlety missing in my artistic vision.",
  ["2225102_7"]="Thank you for your encouraging words, Head Librarian. Although others say my technique is flawless, there's a certain subtlety missing in my artistic vision.",
  ["2225102_8"]="Calligraphy is such a subtle art form, and I'm still grappling with what's eluding me.",
  ["2225102_9"]="It is unusual to see Qing appear hesitant, as she typically exudes confidence. Maybe she has reached a plateau and requires some assistance.",
  ["2225103_1"]="As we explain our intentions to the calligrapher who outperformed Qing, he shows understanding.",
  ["2225103_10"]="I have a feeling this dummy won't last...",
  ["2225103_11"]="Yeah, thank you.",
  ["2225103_12"]="Ahem, I'll pay attention to my movements.",
  ["2225103_13"]="Let's find a suitable spot to practice.",
  ["2225103_2"]="Our discussions on calligraphy have been insightful, Secretary Qing. I might have some suggestions to help you improve.",
  ["2225103_3"]="They say calligraphy mirrors the soul of the artist. From your work, I sense a leader who is just and upright, but perhaps the pressures you face daily manifest in your calligraphy.",
  ["2225103_4"]="As the saying goes, the essence of calligraphy stems from one's spirit. If you could find a way to relax, your calligraphy might not appear as sharp.",
  ["2225103_5"]="To relax, you say...",
  ["2225103_6"]="I have a method for cultivating the mind: martial arts practice. Martial arts sharpen the mind, focusing on the importance of fluid movements in daily training. I've incorporated lessons from martial arts into my calligraphy.",
  ["2225103_7"]="If you're interested, feel free to use my practice dummy.",
  ["2225103_8"]="Don't worry if it breaks. Just fix it up before returning it.",
  ["2225103_9"]="Why not give it a shot?",
  ["2225201_1"]="Guided by Qing, I reach a small, secluded square where she can practice undisturbed.",
  ["2225201_2"]="I'll start practicing right now.",
  ["2225201_3"]="If possible, I'd love to hear your thoughts on my movements and any mistakes I make.",
  ["2225202_1"]="Qing strikes the wooden dummy with a wooden blade. Her movements are meticulously controlled yet still radiate an excessive amount of strength.",
  ["2225202_10"]="Upon hearing my jest, Qing can't help but chuckle.",
  ["2225202_11"]="That's a good one, Head Librarian. I know what I should be doing, but old habits die hard...",
  ["2225202_12"]="A brief moment of vexation crosses Qing's face.",
  ["2225202_13"]="I'll be more careful next time.",
  ["2225202_14"]="Don't worry, it's okay.",
  ["2225202_15"]="Let me help you fix up the dummy.",
  ["2225202_2"]="With a swift motion, she cleanly cleaves the dummy in half.",
  ["2225202_3"]="What the...?!",
  ["2225202_4"]="Qing.",
  ["2225202_5"]="You're taking this way too seriously.",
  ["2225202_6"]="This isn't a battlefield, you know.",
  ["2225202_7"]="There's still plenty of room for... regression.",
  ["2225202_8"]="Sorry, Head Librarian. I'm too accustomed to those special training dummies back in WeiShi.",
  ["2225202_9"]="Sorry, Head Librarian. I'm too accustomed to the WeiShi operations where I had to go all out to tackle any obstacle in my way...",
  ["2225203_1"]="After I repair the dummy, Qing resumes her practice.",
  ["2225203_10"]="Ah, sorry, Head Librarian. They say a calm mind leads to a calm body, but I'm far from reaching that state.",
  ["2225203_11"]="Thank you for your concern, Head Librarian, but this level of exercise is a walk in the park for me.",
  ["2225203_12"]="Maybe it's the heat and those pesky insects buzzing around. They're quite the distraction.",
  ["2225203_13"]="I see.",
  ["2225203_14"]="Don't worry.",
  ["2225203_15"]="I'll get rid of them.",
  ["2225203_2"]="Perhaps wary of repeating her previous mistake, she becomes much more meticulous, leaving no mark on the dummy.",
  ["2225203_3"]="Something still doesn't feel quite right...",
  ["2225203_4"]="Upon closer observation, I notice Qing appeared somewhat distracted, a state unusual for her.",
  ["2225203_5"]="Qing.",
  ["2225203_6"]="What's happening?",
  ["2225203_7"]="You seem a bit distracted.",
  ["2225203_8"]="Feeling tired?",
  ["2225203_9"]="Ah, sorry, Head Librarian. It's not often I have you watching my training, but I'm having trouble calming down.",
  ["2225205_1"]="After I deal with the insects, Qing's movements become notably smoother.",
  ["2225205_10"]="So you're saying I've been too gentle with the dummy? I'd love to unleash my full power, but that won't help my calligraphy skills.",
  ["2225205_11"]="Qing flashes a wry smile, evident that she has recognized her issues as well.",
  ["2225205_12"]="Striking the right balance is quite the challenge.",
  ["2225205_13"]="Watching Qing's movements, I begin to grasp the pattern of the dummy.",
  ["2225205_14"]="The dummy enters a dormant state upon taking an excessively heavy blow and only returns to its original state after a set period.",
  ["2225205_15"]="When it becomes dormant, it is time to stop, and when it is reactivated, it is time to strike again. Constantly launching attacks or retraining movements would be counterproductive.",
  ["2225205_16"]="Witnessing this scene, an idea surfaces in my mind.",
  ["2225205_17"]="How about...",
  ["2225205_18"]="Let me give it a shot?",
  ["2225205_19"]="Would you demonstrate for me, Head Librarian?",
  ["2225205_2"]="Nevertheless, I still sense Qing is over-restrained, lacking her previous assertiveness.",
  ["2225205_20"]="Sounds good. Watching you might help me catch my mistakes.",
  ["2225205_3"]="Mastering the art of balance proves to be a challenging task.",
  ["2225205_4"]="Qing.",
  ["2225205_5"]="You're being too gentle.",
  ["2225205_6"]="I don't mind fixing the dummy again.",
  ["2225205_7"]="I actually prefer your earlier intensity.",
  ["2225205_8"]="Yeah, just as you said, Head Librarian. The mere thought of breaking the dummy again makes me cringe.",
  ["2225205_9"]="So you're saying I've been too gentle on the dummy? I appreciate your help with fixing it, but if I repeat my previous moves, it won't benefit my training.",
  ["2225206_1"]="I demonstrate a series of balanced attacks to Qing. Through my repeated strikes, she begins to discern the patterns as well.",
  ["2225206_10"]="A relaxed state of mind, do you mean that? Yeah, I'll try to hold on to this feeling.",
  ["2225206_11"]="Yeah, I haven't felt this content in a while, practicing here with you.",
  ["2225206_12"]="Absolutely. You're already a mentor to me in calligraphy.",
  ["2225206_13"]="I believe I'll master the technique and win the next calligraphy contest.",
  ["2225206_14"]="That's wonderful to hear.",
  ["2225206_15"]="I'll be there to support you.",
  ["2225206_16"]="Don't stress even if you don't win.",
  ["2225206_17"]="Aha, then I'll have to give it my all.",
  ["2225206_18"]="You have a gentle soul, Head Librarian, but I'm quite competitive. When I compete, I aim for the top spot naturally.",
  ["2225206_19"]="It's getting late. Why don't you head home, Head Librarian? I'll stay a bit longer to practice.",
  ["2225206_2"]="Swinging a sword takes strength, but handling a brush needs finesse and fluidity... I think I'm starting to understand the secrets.",
  ["2225206_20"]="Sure, just don't push yourself too hard.",
  ["2225206_21"]="See you tomorrow.",
  ["2225206_3"]="There's a technique called the \"sheathed edge\" in calligraphy. I think that's what I've been missing.",
  ["2225206_4"]="Your movements are really enlightening, Head Librarian. Thanks for demonstrating.",
  ["2225206_5"]="Having resolved the long-standing problem, Qing reveals a revitalized smile, her usual furrowed brow now relaxed.",
  ["2225206_6"]="Seeing this, I feel relieved.",
  ["2225206_7"]="That's great to hear. Keep it up.",
  ["2225206_8"]="You seem really happy.",
  ["2225206_9"]="Am I helping?",
  ["2226101_1"]="Just as I was wondering where Azi had disappeared to, she suddenly sprang in front of me with her Swallow Step.",
  ["2226101_10"]="Ugh, I can't win with you... Fine, can you at least hold this small bag for me?",
  ["2226101_11"]="You should eat more! With that tiny frame, running around all day is going to wear you out.",
  ["2226101_12"]="Wow, no wonder you're the Head Librarian of Eme-an. So dependable!",
  ["2226101_13"]="But then again, with all these bags, why do I get the feeling that Azi isn't here just for sightseeing, but for...",
  ["2226101_14"]="Are you here to...",
  ["2226101_15"]="Shoot a vlog?",
  ["2226101_16"]="Stream live?",
  ["2226101_17"]="Too bad—close, but not quite!",
  ["2226101_18"]="Yep, I'm here to shoot a vlog! This is Qingyu City, a top tourist hotspot! So many things happened when I was here before, and I never got the chance to explore properly. Now's my chance to capture it all and make it to the trending charts!",
  ["2226101_19"]="I'd rather just enjoy the sights...",
  ["2226101_2"]="Hey, you're right on time! Did you sleep well last night? We're spending the whole day exploring Qingyu City today!",
  ["2226101_20"]="Sounds intriguing.",
  ["2226101_21"]="Sorry, but filming on my own is exhausting. With you helping, it'll be so much easier.",
  ["2226101_22"]="How about this? If today's shoot goes smoothly, I'll treat you to a fancy dinner! Uh... even if it doesn't, we'll still eat!",
  ["2226101_23"]="Alright, then.",
  ["2226101_24"]="Is this for real?",
  ["2226101_25"]="Guess I have no choice but to help.",
  ["2226101_26"]="I knew you'd understand me! How about we team up for a livestream someday? I bet we'd make a great duo.",
  ["2226101_27"]="If today's filming goes well, I'll treat you to a big meal! And... if it doesn't go well, there's still food!",
  ["2226101_28"]="Thank you.",
  ["2226101_29"]="Is this for real?",
  ["2226101_3"]="I noticed Azi lugging an assortment of bags—her Tang Sect mechanical case, various camera gear, and a backpack crammed with tissues, a hand mirror, makeup, snacks... you name it.",
  ["2226101_30"]="Let me fill you in on today's filming plan. Qingyu City is famous for its ancient architecture, so I plan to capture the city's scenery with a drone.",
  ["2226101_31"]="The view's better from upstairs. I'll head up and check out some filming spots.",
  ["2226101_4"]="The moment she saw me, she casually shoved a few bags into my hands.",
  ["2226101_5"]="Wait a moment...",
  ["2226101_6"]="I'm really not that strong.",
  ["2226101_7"]="Leave the bags to me.",
  ["2226101_8"]="Oh, come on, don't refuse! Are you really going to make me carry all this on my own?",
  ["2226101_9"]="You can snack on anything in the bags, and if you're tired, we can stop to rest anytime.",
  ["2226102_1"]="With a quick Swallow Step, Azi sprang onto the rooftop, leaving me standing below.",
  ["2226102_2"]="I can't fly...",
  ["2226102_3"]="Guess I'll take the stairs.",
  ["2226103_1"]="As I made my way toward Azi, a group of monkeys suddenly dashed out from the nearby underbrush, cutting me off halfway there.",
  ["2226103_10"]="I focused on a particularly strong-looking monkey, probably their leader. Raising my stick, I feigned a powerful strike aimed at its head, stopping just short of contact. Beneath the shadow of my stick, the monkey's defiant glare shifted into one of surprised clarity.",
  ["2226103_11"]="The monkey king let out a sharp screech, causing the other monkeys to scatter in a panic. With my victory secured, I calmly retreated.",
  ["2226103_12"]="Justice shall prevail.",
  ["2226103_13"]="(Maintain composure)",
  ["2226103_14"]="A sudden inspiration struck me. Reaching into my pocket, I pulled out a handful of mustard chili candies, a gift personally made by Xin. Tossing them into the air like a divine offering, I scattered the candies among the monkeys.",
  ["2226103_15"]="The monkeys instinctively lunged for the treats, but one by one, they were overwhelmed by the fiery spice. They scampered off in tears, completely defeated.",
  ["2226103_16"]="Forgive me, Xin.",
  ["2226103_17"]="Perhaps someone out there will one day appreciate your culinary creations...",
  ["2226103_18"]="Huh? What's going on? Where did all these monkeys come from?",
  ["2226103_19"]="Azi finally turned around, startled by the sight of the fleeing monkeys. Her shock quickly faded into a puzzled smile as she noticed me standing behind her, stick in hand, like a steadfast guardian.",
  ["2226103_2"]="These creatures caused me a lot of trouble when I first arrived in Qingyu City, and now they're trying to ambush Azi while she's busy filming. This is unacceptable!",
  ["2226103_20"]="Did you just... do something incredible?",
  ["2226103_21"]="That's a long story...",
  ["2226103_22"]="It's all taken care of now.",
  ["2226103_23"]="Try not to get too absorbed in filming next time.",
  ["2226103_24"]="Just as I was about to elaborate, a third voice suddenly called out from below.",
  ["2226103_25"]="Who are you people, and what are you doing on my roof?",
  ["2226103_26"]="Hmm...",
  ["2226103_27"]="(Toes curling with guilt)",
  ["2226103_28"]="Ah! Sorry, I was just trying to shoot a video. I'll come down right away!",
  ["2226103_29"]="Heh, young people these days. Climbing up so high—reminds me of my own adventurous youth.",
  ["2226103_3"]="Luckily, I had the foresight to buy a Monkey Repelling Staff. Rushing to Azi's side, I swung the staff, fending off a dozen mischievous monkeys. Meanwhile, Azi remained completely oblivious to the chaos unfolding behind her.",
  ["2226103_4"]="Back! Back! Back!",
  ["2226103_5"]="(Maintain composure)",
  ["2226103_6"]="(Scared, but doesn't show it)",
  ["2226103_7"]="Intimidated by my commanding presence, the monkeys hesitated to attack, instead prowling nearby and occasionally reaching out with mischievous hands, either to taunt me or snatch at our luggage.",
  ["2226103_8"]="Strike first",
  ["2226103_9"]="Go with the flow",
  ["2226104_1"]="Sorry... I really thought no one was here.",
  ["2226104_10"]="Understood.",
  ["2226104_11"]="Let's head out right away!",
  ["2226104_2"]="What do we do now?",
  ["2226104_3"]="Should we find another rooftop?",
  ["2226104_4"]="I'm kind of hungry.",
  ["2226104_5"]="Ugh, stop teasing me already!",
  ["2226104_6"]="Oh? I've got snacks in my bag. Why don't you grab some to tide you over?",
  ["2226104_7"]="By the way, before coming to Qingyu City, I came across a food guide. There's this famous tavern I've been wanting to try.",
  ["2226104_8"]="It's almost noon anyway. How about we head there for a feast?",
  ["2226104_9"]="As she spoke, Azi turned to me with an expectant look, her eyes practically pleading for my opinion.",
  ["2226105_1"]="Look, there it is! That's the tavern I've been talking about.",
  ["2226105_2"]="I've heard this place has been around for a century, passed down through five generations, and specializes in local cuisine. Hmm... I wonder if it's as delicious as the rumors say.",
  ["2226105_3"]="Come on, it's not far. Just head down the stairs, and we'll be there in no time.",
  ["2226106_1"]="I remember Azi once telling me, a long time ago, that when everything settled down, she'd take me sightseeing around Qingyu City. Now, she's finally here to fulfill that promise.",
  ["2226106_2"]="She asked to meet me here, but where is she? Maybe I should look around nearby.",
  ["2226107_1"]="When I reached the rooftop, I found Azi fully engrossed in piloting her \"Little Sky\" drone. True to her reputation as a pro vlogger, her every move exuded focus and determination...",
  ["2226107_2"]="Head over to Azi.",
  ["2226107_3"]="The view here really is amazing.",
  ["2226201_1"]="We approached the tavern with great anticipation, only to find its doors firmly shut. A group of patrons had gathered outside, and someone who looked like the owner was busy calming the crowd.",
  ["2226201_10"]="There's no need to go through all that trouble. Why don't we help them look for the key?",
  ["2226201_11"]="Do you have a plan?",
  ["2226201_12"]="Do you have some sort of magic tool?",
  ["2226201_13"]="The Tang mechanical Techniques know no bounds!",
  ["2226201_14"]="Tada! This is where my little Sky comes into play. It's not just any drone—I even customized it with a laser scanning function. Perfect for finding things like this!",
  ["2226201_15"]="Quick, take some shots of me helping out the townsfolk! Posting this online is sure to get me another wave of followers!",
  ["2226201_2"]="How strange. What's going on? Are they closed today?",
  ["2226201_3"]="Let's go ask.",
  ["2226201_4"]="My apologies, everyone. There's a power outage at the tavern, and we're unable to serve customers for now.",
  ["2226201_5"]="A power outage? Have you called someone to fix it?",
  ["2226201_6"]="Hearing this, the tavern owner looked troubled.",
  ["2226201_7"]="That's the problem... The electrician is here, but we can't find the only key to the electrical box. We might end up needing to call a locksmith instead.",
  ["2226201_8"]="Uh...",
  ["2226201_9"]="Should we just find another place?",
  ["2226202_1"]="Oops, that's not the key—just a metal bottle cap. If you can't remember, you can always return to Azi for another scan.",
  ["2226203_1"]="The key in my pocket is for the front door, not the electrical box.",
  ["2226203_2"]="Not quite... If you're unsure, you can head back to Azi for another scan.",
  ["2226204_1"]="Found it! This looks like the key to the electrical box. Let's return it to the owner.",
  ["2226205_1"]="The drone is scanning the area. Keep an eye out for anything suspicious...",
  ["2226206_1"]="Oh, this is it—our electrical box key! Thank you so much.",
  ["2226206_2"]="We'll fix the issue right away. The tavern will be up and running shortly. Please, come inside and take a seat while you wait.",
  ["2226206_3"]="Before long, the tavern came alive as the lights flickered on and diners began streaming in. The hall buzzed with lively chatter, mostly from the regular patrons.",
  ["2226206_4"]="Our dishes arrived quickly, but I had to wait patiently while Azi snapped a flurry of pictures before I could finally pick up my chopsticks.",
  ["2226206_5"]="Hmm, the food really lives up to the hype. This trip was worth it.",
  ["2226206_6"]="Whew, I'm stuffed! Are you ready? Let's head to the next filming spot!",
  ["2226207_1"]="Keep an eye on those spots—we'll need to check them out in person later.",
  ["2226301_1"]="Drone battery—check! Flying conditions—check! Flight path—check!",
  ["2226301_2"]="Little Sky, prepare for takeoff!",
  ["2226301_3"]="We arrived at a new location, planning to capture the scenic views from halfway up the mountain. Azi immediately got busy with her drone again.",
  ["2226301_4"]="With her skilled operation, the drone took off smoothly and began gliding into the distance.",
  ["2226301_5"]="Huh? Why are you standing so far away? Come over here and check out the footage with me!",
  ["2226301_6"]="At her invitation, I moved closer and watched as the drone transmitted live footage back to us.",
  ["2226302_1"]="Midway through filming, a flock of birds suddenly attacked the drone. Thankfully, we managed to recover it in one piece—otherwise, Azi might have been inconsolable.",
  ["2226302_10"]="That's why I said, \"short break\". With me, Azi, handling things, there's no way you won't have a great time. Trust me, tonight's event will be totally worth it!",
  ["2226302_11"]="What kind of event?",
  ["2226302_12"]="The event is... Hehe, I'm not telling you yet!",
  ["2226302_13"]="The best surprises are always saved for the last moment. Let's meet at the ancestral home at seven.",
  ["2226302_14"]="For now, it's free time. Want to find a spot to relax or tag along with me for some shopping?",
  ["2226302_15"]="I'll rest for a bit.",
  ["2226302_16"]="I'll go with you.",
  ["2226302_17"]="Okay, if you find anything fun or delicious, don't forget to text me!",
  ["2226302_18"]="Alright, I'm off then. Don't miss me too much!",
  ["2226302_19"]="Yay, I knew you were the best! Let's go, let's go—I'll choose something for you, and you pick something for me. Huh? Why not just buy it ourselves? Because gifts always feel more meaningful when they come from someone else, of course!",
  ["2226302_2"]="Why are we so unlucky? If this trip had been live-streamed, it might've gone viral...",
  ["2226302_3"]="Is the footage still usable?",
  ["2226302_4"]="Are we still going to continue?",
  ["2226302_5"]="Hmm? That's fine—I've already got plenty of good shots. I'll just edit out the last part.",
  ["2226302_6"]="Let's take a short break. It's almost nighttime.",
  ["2226302_7"]="Is today's sightseeing over?",
  ["2226302_8"]="I'm not done having fun yet...",
  ["2226302_9"]="Not at all. Actually, there's an event happening tonight at the Tianli Ancestral Home.",
  ["2227101_1"]="Azi and I had spent the day filming a vlog in Qingyu City. As night fell, we made our way to the Tianli Ancestral Residence as planned.",
  ["2227101_10"]="Here it is—the famous ancestor worship ceremony of the Tianli people. It's held once a year, and many tourists come to watch.",
  ["2227101_11"]="I see.",
  ["2227101_12"]="However...",
  ["2227101_13"]="Isn't this happening tomorrow during the day?",
  ["2227101_14"]="Heh, you don't get it. Tomorrow, the event will be crowded, and it'll be hard to get good shots! So...",
  ["2227101_15"]="I'm here early to film the rehearsal. This is my exclusive scoop!",
  ["2227101_16"]="Hehe, indeed. Azi has been very interested in our Tianli culture and has asked me a lot about the history of our ceremonies.",
  ["2227101_17"]="Seeing how much she cares about our rituals, I couldn't help but lend her a hand.",
  ["2227101_18"]="But...",
  ["2227101_19"]="The elderly man's expression suddenly darkens.",
  ["2227101_2"]="Azi, always quick on her feet, had already struck up a lively conversation with an elderly man as soon as we arrived. Judging by their animated exchange, they seemed to be old acquaintances.",
  ["2227101_20"]="I'm ashamed to say, my old bones aren't what they used to be. Just on the eve of such a solemn ceremony, I somehow managed to sprain my back.",
  ["2227101_21"]="Are you alright?",
  ["2227101_22"]="Will you still host the ceremony?",
  ["2227101_23"]="Should we find someone to replace you?",
  ["2227101_24"]="Thank you, young one. It's nothing serious, just need to rest for a day.",
  ["2227101_25"]="It's nothing serious, just need to rest for a day.",
  ["2227101_26"]="No need to worry, it's just a minor injury. I only need a day of rest.",
  ["2227101_27"]="The ceremony will go on as planned tomorrow, but tonight's rehearsal has to be canceled. I'm truly sorry, Azi.",
  ["2227101_28"]="Don't say that; your health is more important.",
  ["2227101_29"]="Even so, it's a shame that Azi and I came all the way to Tianli's ancestral home, only to miss the chance to film the rehearsal.",
  ["2227101_3"]="Good evening.",
  ["2227101_30"]="The rehearsal host...",
  ["2227101_31"]="Can someone else fill in for you?",
  ["2227101_32"]="Are you suggesting that...",
  ["2227101_33"]="You're proposing to take my place and host the rehearsal? Hmm, not a bad idea... Practicing now will make it less likely for mistakes tomorrow.",
  ["2227101_34"]="If we're going with that, we'd better inform the clan's patriarch.",
  ["2227101_4"]="Do you two know each other?",
  ["2227101_5"]="What a polite young person you are!",
  ["2227101_6"]="Allow me to introduce you. This elderly gentleman is the host of the event, and we've already received permission from the Tianli people for our shoot!",
  ["2227101_7"]="So, the event...",
  ["2227101_8"]="What exactly is it?",
  ["2227101_9"]="Finally, the moment to reveal the mystery arrived, and Azi eagerly pulled out her phone to show me.",
  ["2227102_1"]="I told Li Chi about the situation, and his expression became noticeably complicated.",
  ["2227102_10"]="Li Chi looks like he's trying to keep his temper in check as he continues to explain.",
  ["2227102_11"]="In Tianli lore, birds are considered the creators of the world. For generations, we've raised birds as symbols of the divine and included them in our ancestral ceremonies. Since most of these birds are now protected species, we use pheasants as substitutes.",
  ["2227102_12"]="The divine bird flies around the house to drive away pests and miasma, bringing good fortune.",
  ["2227102_13"]="How do we wake it up?",
  ["2227102_14"]="Are you participating in the ceremony too?",
  ["2227102_15"]="Guess we're not having roast chicken tonight...",
  ["2227102_16"]="Of course. I'm the clan leader of the Tianli people! As part of the ceremony, the leader of each generation is responsible for performing the sacred song and dance to guide the people with the spirit of the divine.",
  ["2227102_17"]="Li Chi glares at me. It's probably best not to push his buttons any further.",
  ["2227102_18"]="I remember the feed is in the jar over there. Give some to the divine bird, and it'll perk right up.",
  ["2227102_2"]="You're stepping in to host the rehearsal? Very well. If the elder agrees, so do I.",
  ["2227102_3"]="If there's going to be a rehearsal, we'll need to awaken the divine bird.",
  ["2227102_4"]="The divine bird?",
  ["2227102_5"]="You mean the pheasant over there?",
  ["2227102_6"]="Wait, isn't that tonight's dinner?",
  ["2227102_7"]="Yes, that pheasant.",
  ["2227102_8"]="Li Chi's expression darkens as he says \"pheasant,\" his voice tinged with both irritation and resignation.",
  ["2227102_9"]="What dinner?! That's the divine bird—a sacred symbol of the ceremony!",
  ["2227103_1"]="I grab the feed and shake it lightly in front of the divine bird's beak.",
  ["2227103_10"]="This ceremony sounds pretty exciting.",
  ["2227103_11"]="Go, divine bird of Tianli!",
  ["2227103_12"]="This is why the Tianli ancestral ceremony is so popular online! It blends rich cultural heritage with performative elements, reflecting the Tianli people's brave and bold nature!",
  ["2227103_13"]="I have this feeling that if you said that, you'd throw a palm-sized orb into the air. It just feels right...",
  ["2227103_14"]="Come on, let's give it a try. The divine bird will show you how it's done. Don't worry, our snakes don't bite.",
  ["2227103_15"]="Wait, wait, wait! Let me set up the camera first!",
  ["2227103_2"]="Peck, peck, peck.",
  ["2227103_3"]="Don't peck me, there's food here.",
  ["2227103_4"]="I wonder if Anchirp would eat this...?",
  ["2227103_5"]="The divine bird slowly woke up, attracted by the scent of the food. It eagerly pecked at what I held in my hand. This pheasant must have been raised with some level of intelligence, as it pecked carefully at the food without causing me any harm.",
  ["2227103_6"]="Ahem, now that the divine bird is awake, let's begin the rehearsal.",
  ["2227103_7"]="Since you're just the acting host, young one, we won't hold you to any strict expectations. All you need to do is guide the divine bird around the ancestral home, while the other clan members rehearse their parts.",
  ["2227103_8"]="Along the way, we'll release some docile, non-venomous snakes. You just need to pretend to chase them away. The divine bird will help you with that.",
  ["2227103_9"]="We've also set up smoke around the ancestral home to mimic miasma. The sacred bird will help disperse it.",
  ["2227104_1"]="The divine bird taunted the snake, but the snake didn't react at all.",
  ["2227104_2"]="Looking back, I've dealt with plenty of tricky animals in Qingyu City. A mere pet snake doesn't stand a chance.",
  ["2227104_3"]="I know what to.",
  ["2227104_4"]="Let me give it a shot.",
  ["2227105_1"]="That's it! You're doing great, young one.",
  ["2227105_10"]="Here, I'll send you ten of my best pictures. That should even things out.",
  ["2227105_11"]="Ahem, the clan members are all in place, and the clan's patriarch has started the music. The rehearsal can begin at any time.",
  ["2227105_12"]="I'm ready too.",
  ["2227105_13"]="Azi, what about you?",
  ["2227105_14"]="You guys are so quick! Wait a second; I'll get the drone up and running right away!",
  ["2227105_15"]="Drone is all set!",
  ["2227105_2"]="Hmph, don't worry. I've got your heroic pose down perfectly.",
  ["2227105_3"]="I know you can't appear on public platforms, but is fine for me to keep it for myself?",
  ["2227105_4"]="Azi...",
  ["2227105_5"]="Don't love me, it won't work out.",
  ["2227105_6"]="I charge for the use of my likeness.",
  ["2227105_7"]="Hmm? I've got a bunch of videos here, like the one of Xin in the \"Great Eater Challenge,\" Qing receiving an award, and Ming giving a talk on folk culture. Should I send them to you?",
  ["2227105_8"]="Azi laughed so hard at my joke she nearly doubled over. After catching her breath and wiping away tears, she finally spoke.",
  ["2227105_9"]="Alright, alright, I admit you've got me beat when it comes to the fancy handshake.",
  ["2227106_1"]="Thanks to the teamwork between me and the Tianli clan members, the rehearsal went off without a hitch. The Tianli Elder looked on, clearly pleased with the outcome.",
  ["2227106_10"]="(Please, not that.)",
  ["2227106_11"]="(I feel completely drained already.)",
  ["2227106_12"]="(I'll shut down in 30 seconds.)",
  ["2227106_13"]="Azi's voice seemed to grow fainter and fainter in my ears. The world around me felt like it was twisting and spinning. Before I knew it, everything went black, and I collapsed.",
  ["2227106_14"]="Hey, hey, you passed out? Do you have any candy on you? This looks like a blood sugar crash!",
  ["2227106_15"]="And so, my incredibly long day in Qingyu City with Azi finally came to an end.",
  ["2227106_2"]="Young one, you've worked hard today. Thanks to you, tomorrow's ceremony will surely be a success.",
  ["2227106_3"]="Hehe, I should thank you too. I managed to get so many rare shots tonight!",
  ["2227106_4"]="You're welcome to join us tomorrow to watch the official ceremony. We'll do our best to host all the guests.",
  ["2227106_5"]="I spent the whole day with Azi exploring Qingyu City, and it was such a fulfilling day. I'm completely worn out, but Azi? She's still going strong, totally fired up, and as dedicated as ever...",
  ["2227106_6"]="Wait a second, tomorrow is the official ceremony. Does that mean...? I suddenly have a bad feeling.",
  ["2227106_7"]="Azi, you won't...",
  ["2227106_8"]="Tomorrow we won't...",
  ["2227106_9"]="Of course, I'll be there to livestream the ceremony tomorrow. After that, I'll meet up with fans, then head to the Imperial City exhibition, and in the evening, we can check out the night market and play some mini-games... You should come along too! One day of fun definitely won't be enough!",
  ["2227107_1"]="Li Chi sat on the roof, playing his flute. When he saw me, he tucked it away and stood up.",
  ["2227107_2"]="It's you.",
  ["2227107_3"]="Good evening.",
  ["2227107_4"]="Why are you sitting on the roof?",
  ["2227107_5"]="That was a nice tune.",
  ["2227107_6"]="Good evening. No need for pleasantries. Your companion's over there, waiting.",
  ["2227107_7"]="This is my home. I can sit wherever I like.",
  ["2227107_8"]="Instead of chatting with me, why not find your companion? She's over there.",
  ["2227107_9"]="Thanks. Your companion is waiting over there.",
  ["2227108_1"]="A brightly feathered pheasant, curled up on the ground, fast asleep, as it's accustomed to being active during the day and resting at night.",
  ["2227108_2"]="Why is there a pheasant here? Is the Tianli family planning to cook it for tonight's feast?",
  ["2228101_1"]="Not long after the Cerulean Water incident was resolved, Azi suddenly called Zero and me out one night.",
  ["2228101_13"]="What? You seriously don't remember me?",
  ["2228101_14"]="I'm the one who got lost in the Forbidden Zone during the curfew… remember?",
  ["2228101_16"]="He's the self-proclaimed fishing expert, Seer. The one who spent entire day by the water without catching any fish.",
  ["2228101_18"]="Ugh, please… let's not bring that up again...",
  ["2228101_19"]="Well, I guess forgetting can be a blessing sometimes. Thanks for being so nice about it.",
  ["2228101_2"]="Over here, over here!",
  ["2228101_21"]="It's just a little thank-you gift for you guys… y'know, for covering for me and, uh, keeping my 'zero catch' fishing disaster a secret. I put it together just for you.",
  ["2228101_22"]="Alright, alright, enough with the small talk, let's get moving! If you see anyone on the way, don't hesitate, just go up and keep them busy. As for why... I'll explain on the way!",
  ["2228101_23"]="Good evening.",
  ["2228101_25"]="What is it?",
  ["2228101_28"]="Forbidden Zone?",
  ["2228101_29"]="Oh, now I remember!",
  ["2228101_30"]="Still does not ring a bell.",
  ["2228101_31"]="What's in the box you're holding?",
  ["2228101_32"]="And who's this guy, anyway?",
  ["2228101_33"]="I have no idea what's going on!",
  ["2228101_34"]="Got lost?",
  ["2228101_4"]="You got the stuff?",
  ["2228101_5"]="Yep, all here!",
  ["2228101_6"]="Nice, nice, lots of variety too!",
  ["2228101_7"]="I'll leave the rest to you guys!",
  ["2228101_8"]="Alright, now that everyone's here and we've got everything we need, let's get moving.",
  ["2228101_9"]="...",
  ["2228102_1"]="Hey! Who are you? Why are you creeping around",
  ["2228102_2"]="Gotta head over and distract him before he catches the other guy moving the stuff!",
  ["2228102_3"]="Timing's key here! Start talking too early, and we might finish up before he's in the clear. Start too late, and we'll mess up the whole plan!",
  ["2228103_10"]="Uh... well...",
  ["2228103_11"]="Because we need to get to the best spot to set them off as fast as we can! If people saw us with all these fireworks, they'd definitely stop us and ask where we got them. Answering everyone would waste a ton of time!",
  ["2228103_12"]="What was that about...?",
  ["2228103_13"]="So it was fireworks...",
  ["2228103_14"]="If it's not dangerous, then why go through the trouble of distracting people to keep it a secret?",
  ["2228103_15"]="I see...",
  ["2228103_2"]="Just a distraction!",
  ["2228103_3"]="Can't let anyone find out I'm moving fireworks!",
  ["2228103_5"]="Fireworks? I've read about them in books, but I've never actually seen one up close.",
  ["2228103_6"]="Are fireworks considered dangerous here in Qian?",
  ["2228103_7"]="Uh... I guess not.",
  ["2228103_8"]="Don't worry, I double-checked everything. As long as you handle them right, there won't be any problems.",
  ["2228104_1"]="Reserving a spot",
  ["2228105_1"]="How on earth did you find us? We thought we'd hidden ourselves pretty well!",
  ["2228105_10"]="Apologies, Miss Xin. We honestly are not aware about the rules here.",
  ["2228105_11"]="Well… if you really didn't know, I'll let it slide this time.",
  ["2228105_12"]="So... can we...",
  ["2228105_13"]="No way you're getting off that easy!",
  ["2228105_14"]="*Cough*",
  ["2228105_15"]="Ming, you too! Never thought you'd get caught doing something like this! Heh, I'm definitely reporting all of you to Qing!",
  ["2228105_16"]="Uh... but we didn't even set off any fireworks...",
  ["2228105_17"]="You think I'm blind or something?",
  ["2228105_18"]="Actually, <color=#fec66b>we're hosting a self-funded volunteer event to get rid of fireworks</color>.",
  ["2228105_19"]="Huh? Getting rid of fireworks?",
  ["2228105_20"]="Knew you'd come through, Ming!",
  ["2228105_21"]="I mean, you need fire to properly get rid of fireworks, right?",
  ["2228105_22"]="I see...",
  ["2228105_24"]="I-I mean... is that even... true?",
  ["2228105_25"]="Yeah, yeah! That's right!",
  ["2228105_26"]="As long as our goal is to \"get rid\" of the fireworks, we don't really need to worry about the fact that we're technically setting them off.",
  ["2228105_27"]="We just think \"getting rid\" of fireworks would be this loud. Anyway, since you're here, you might as well join us in finishing off the rest!",
  ["2228105_28"]="Yeah, the more hands the better! The sooner we finish, the sooner we can... uh, have some fun!",
  ["2228105_29"]="#TangSectKidsGettingRidFireworks... Now we're totally covered!",
  ["2228105_3"]="Come on, fireworks are loud and flashy! You really thought no one would notice?",
  ["2228105_30"]="Something still feels off about this...",
  ["2228105_31"]="Before Xin could say another word, Ming shoved a sparkler into her hand. And just like that, we were back to \"getting rid\" of the fireworks. The misunderstanding got cleared up, and nobody had to file any reports. What a relief.",
  ["2228105_32"]="So they really are banned after all, huh...",
  ["2228105_34"]="I didn't know fireworks were banned!",
  ["2228105_35"]="(Ask Zero for help.)",
  ["2228105_36"]="Sounds like a total stretch!",
  ["2228105_4"]="And Azi, you even started a livestream!",
  ["2228105_5"]="#TangSectMechnismsInCangLinCity... See? I even had the perfect hashtag ready! It wasn't fireworks, it was a tech demo!",
  ["2228105_6"]="You think anyone's buying that?",
  ["2228105_7"]="This area's under my patrol. All of you, head back to the station and file your reports!",
  ["2228105_8"]="Ugh... Why are you being so stubborn now, of all times? Xiaomin Ming, think of something! And you too, Head Librarian! Don't just stand there! You're an accomplice too!",
  ["2228201_1"]="Hi there!",
  ["2228201_10"]="That's all for now!",
  ["2228201_2"]="Huh? Oh, hey. Can I help you?",
  ["2228201_3"]="Yes, actually! We're doing a live street interview for a random Q&A event!",
  ["2228201_4"]="Oh, cool! Ask away! I've got answers for everything!",
  ["2228201_5"]="What do you think of this kind of live street interview?",
  ["2228201_6"]="I think it's great, haha!",
  ["2228201_7"]="Thanks for your answer!",
  ["2228201_8"]="Huh?",
  ["2228201_9"]="Wait, is that it? You're not gonna ask me more?",
  ["2228202_1"]="Hey there! We're live on the street doing interviews. Got a minute to answer a few quick questions?",
  ["2228202_2"]="Not interested.",
  ["2228202_3"]="Thanks for your time anyway!",
  ["2228203_1"]="Head Librarian, help me out here! Even a social butterfly like me is running out of ideas!",
  ["2228203_10"]="I see, thank you for the recommendation.",
  ["2228203_11"]="Hmm... Let me think... maybe there's somewhere else.",
  ["2228203_12"]="You didn't even ask a real question!",
  ["2228203_14"]="Uh, um...",
  ["2228203_3"]="Can I help you?",
  ["2228203_5"]="Let me handle this. I've read a few books on talking to strangers.",
  ["2228203_6"]="What kind of book teaches you how to make awkward small talk with strangers?",
  ["2228203_7"]="Hello! We're new to CangLin City. Could you recommend any good places to visit?",
  ["2228203_8"]="Guess she read a tourist guidebook on how to talk to locals... Whatever it was, Zero just saved me!",
  ["2228203_9"]="You've come to the right person! I know this place like the back of my hand! Have you been to the Nongsang Pavilion yet? It's one of the most famous places in CangLin City.",
  ["2228204_1"]="Aha! If it isn't Counselor Ming!",
  ["2228204_2"]="(Yes! Now it's Ming's turn! No slacking off! Go say something already!)",
  ["2228204_3"]="...",
  ["2228204_4"]="Hello.",
  ["2228204_5"]="You were a huge help back in QingYu City!! Never thought I'd run into you again here in CangLin City!",
  ["2228204_6"]="Yeah, small world.",
  ["2228205_1"]="(I should probably keep the conversation going...)",
  ["2228205_10"]="The thing you taught me really helped a ton!",
  ["2228205_11"]="But honestly, I didn't do anything special back in QingYu. I just shared some basic science.",
  ["2228205_3"]="Huh, that's... definitely not something I would've thought of.",
  ["2228205_4"]="Oh, I busted it out at our team-building day at work, put on a little show, and to my surprise, everyone loved it!",
  ["2228205_5"]="Huh? So, what did you end up doing with it?",
  ["2228205_6"]="It worked like magic!",
  ["2228205_7"]="Exactly! You are amazing, Counselor Ming. You nailed it in one go!",
  ["2228205_8"]="White paper, bloody handprints... Ohh, you mean when I explained how phenolphthalein works? It turns pink with a base and goes clear with acid. So you sprayed phenolphthalein on a paper and had some alkaline water and vinegar ready too?",
  ["2228205_9"]="Like... remember that trick you taught me about bloody handprints showing up on white paper?",
  ["2228206_1"]="Hey! Who are you? Why are you creeping around",
  ["2228206_2"]="Timing's key here! Start talking too early, and we might finish up before he's in the clear. Start too late, and we'll mess up the whole plan!",
  ["2229101_1"]="The passage is empty, save for a bronze statue of a black sword that stands out abruptly at a corner.",
  ["2229101_10"]="She now comprehends why her chest tightens involuntarily and her fingers tremble.",
  ["2229101_11"]="It is because a puppetmaster's fingertips are always linked to a strand of strings.",
  ["2229101_12"]="Since her earliest memories, a puppet uniquely hers has been her loyal companion.",
  ["2229101_13"]="Now I remember... I came here to fix that puppet.",
  ["2229101_14"]="With this realization, Yuli gently rests her hand on the black sword and turns it to the right.",
  ["2229101_15"]="With a rumbling sound, a ladder materializes in the once empty space.",
  ["2229101_2"]="What's this?",
  ["2229101_3"]="The sword bears matted bamboo patterns resembling those on her dress.",
  ["2229101_4"]="Then, a memory resurfaces.",
  ["2229101_5"]="A distant figure once taught her how to sew, guiding her as she stitched new garments. As her hands completed the final stitch, the individual affectionately touched her forehead...",
  ["2229101_6"]="\"Bamboo leaves dense, lush array. Bodies neat, in bamboo ballet, they sway. Your name shall be... Yuli, meaning lush bamboo.\"",
  ["2229101_7"]="Yu... li?",
  ["2229101_8"]="Her fragmented memories start to merge.",
  ["2229101_9"]="Yes, I'm Yuli... and I'm not alone.",
  ["2229102_1"]="This black sword is a bit different from what I saw earlier...",
  ["2229102_2"]="The sword triggers a sense of familiarity.",
  ["2229102_3"]="Her puppet once wielded a similar sword, one that the puppet favored, standing in the front, paving the way for her master.",
  ["2229102_4"]="After the banners and drums fell silent, the puppet would sheathe the sword and stand quietly, holding a paper umbrella.",
  ["2229102_5"]="Like the moon goddess from a play...",
  ["2229102_6"]="Sue...",
  ["2229102_7"]="My puppet... Her name is Sue.",
  ["2229102_8"]="Her dominant hand is on the right, thus Sue will always stand by her right side.",
  ["2229102_9"]="With this in mind, Yuli glances at the bronze crane statue to her right.",
  ["2229103_1"]="This is a dead end...",
  ["2229103_2"]="I should turn back.",
  ["2229104_1"]="The rusted and immovable bronze crane statue seems to deter further exploration.",
  ["2229106_1"]="This wrecked puppet still possesses salvageable wooden components.",
  ["2229107_1"]="Ohh! Finally, heading in the right direction!",
  ["2229109_1"]="These shattered puppets offer no salvageable parts.",
  ["2229112_1"]="Scattered around are broken puppets, their bodies shattered yet standing in place, gazing forward, whispering.",
  ["2229112_2"]="They are... <color=#FEC66B>puppets</color>...",
  ["2229112_3"]="But not the one I'm searching for...",
  ["2229112_4"]="Despite their unfamiliarity, these broken figures stir a nostalgic feeling within her.",
  ["2229112_5"]="Let's keep moving... I will remember eventually.",
  ["2229113_1"]="The crane statue appears tethered by a crystal-clear string.",
  ["2229113_2"]="Pull the strings and adapts to situation... puppetmaster would do this.",
  ["2229113_3"]="Driven by an inexplicable urge, Yuli deftly winds the string around her fingers, pulling it firmly.",
  ["2229113_4"]="The crane statue rotates, revealing a hidden passage beneath its pedestal leading to another chamber.",
  ["2229114_1"]="This damaged puppet still possesses salvageable parts.",
  ["2229115_1"]="This faulty puppet is adorned with salvageable strings.",
  ["2229116_1"]="Wait, I need more materials.",
  ["2229116_2"]="That puppet by the door might come in handy.",
  ["2229117_1"]="I sense many puppets in this room.",
  ["2229117_2"]="Maybe I can find the parts I need to fix her here.",
  ["2229401_1"]="Several days have past.",
  ["2229401_10"]="With the weather cooling down, I thought scarves might help keep you warm...",
  ["2229401_11"]="Ohhh, Yuli, you're so considerate! This scarf is incredibly snug! And the patterns are adorable! I'm going to take a picture and share it!",
  ["2229401_12"]="How did you manage to knit such a lovely scarf?",
  ["2229401_13"]="Hmm... it's not difficult.",
  ["2229401_14"]="I simply used my puppetry skills to weave the threads into a scarf shape...",
  ["2229401_15"]="This is incredible! When I tried to learn embroidery as a child, just threading the needle took me ages...",
  ["2229401_16"]="Alright, let's not get into our childhood struggles right now...",
  ["2229401_18"]="The parts delivery has arrived. Let's get going.",
  ["2229401_2"]="Azi and Xin? What brings you here? Do you... need something from me?",
  ["2229401_20"]="Yeah, let's not keep him waiting.",
  ["2229401_3"]="Relax, Qing asked us to drop by.",
  ["2229401_4"]="Qing has already organized the wooden parts you needed. They should be here soon.",
  ["2229401_5"]="Thank you... We've only known each other for a few days, yet you've done so much for me. I don't think I can ever repay your kindness.",
  ["2229401_6"]="Still... please accept this as a token of my gratitude.",
  ["2229401_7"]="Yuli delicately unzips one of her travel bags, cradles the fabric in her palm, and extends it forward.",
  ["2229401_8"]="What's this, a rag? Oh... it's surprisingly cozy and comfy.",
  ["2229401_9"]="A rag, you say?! These are scarves she knitted for us!",
  ["2229402_1"]="Phew, these packages are hefty... Here they are, all yours now.",
  ["2229402_10"]="While she may appear inexperienced in daily affairs, even coming across as clumsy and childlike, in the realm of puppetry, she always demonstrates a sophistication and maturity beyond her years.",
  ["2229402_11"]="She is so engrossed that even when a cat silently approaches her feet, she remains entirely focused.",
  ["2229402_12"]="Meow...",
  ["2229402_13"]="Showing interest in a gear adorned with ribbons, the cat emits a quick purr, snatching the gear and darting towards the street.",
  ["2229402_14"]="Wait...! That part's for Sue!",
  ["2229402_15"]="What are you waiting for? Let's go after it!",
  ["2229402_2"]="Thank you.",
  ["2229402_3"]="Yuli nods politely, methodically arranging the components in the box.",
  ["2229402_4"]="...",
  ["2229402_5"]="However, in the next moment, there is a shift in her gaze.",
  ["2229402_6"]="These grooves are... too shallow.",
  ["2229402_7"]="The joint curvature is slightly misaligned.",
  ["2229402_8"]="The birch at the joint doesn't seem sturdy enough.",
  ["2229402_9"]="Her usual composure fades, replaced by an intense focus bordering on insistence.",
  ["2229403_1"]="Holding her breath, Yuli chased the cat into a corner. Just as the cat is inches away, she lunges forward—",
  ["2229403_10"]="He took something from us, and he needs to give it back! Grab me a sack, and I'll catch him!",
  ["2229403_11"]="Hey, don't be reckless! He has an owner. What if you accidentally hurt him?",
  ["2229403_12"]="How about this... you know the cat's owner, right? Can you help us get in touch with them? They should know how to deal with him.",
  ["2229403_13"]="Yeah, I just talked to her, and she mentioned the cat usually hangs out near the station. She's got some cat food ready to lure him back.",
  ["2229403_14"]="But remember, this cat is cunning, and the cat food won't hold him for long. You've got to <color=#FEC66B>move quickly</color> if you want to catch him!",
  ["2229403_2"]="However, the cat swiftly leaps, effortlessly dodging Yuli's lunge, and leisurely grooms his paws upon landing.",
  ["2229403_3"]="By the time Yuli struggles to her feet, the cat has leapt several feet away and disappeared into the street.",
  ["2229403_4"]="That cat... outsmarted me...",
  ["2229403_5"]="That cat is annoyingly quick with his reactions... No worries, I've got this!",
  ["2229403_6"]="Hang on, are you here for... Big Chunk?",
  ["2229403_7"]="Big Chunk? Is that the cat's name?",
  ["2229403_8"]="Well, since you're new here, it's no surprise you don't know him well.",
  ["2229403_9"]="Big Chunk is the orange cat from the house next door. He's wild and aggressive, and loves messing with new people. I just saw him carrying something in his mouth... He probably sees you as intruders.",
  ["2229404_1"]="Here, kitty... Good boy...",
  ["2229404_10"]="Ahh... let's just follow her.",
  ["2229404_2"]="Seizing the moment as the cat buries his head in the cat food, Yuli cautiously extends her hand, gently supporting his back. Her other hand delicately reaches towards the stolen gear.",
  ["2229404_3"]="However, just as her fingertips near the gear, the cat pricks up his ears in alarm.",
  ["2229404_4"]="Meow!!",
  ["2229404_5"]="Ah! This cat is angry!",
  ["2229404_6"]="Huh? This pesky cat thinks he's the boss here?!",
  ["2229404_7"]="Move aside! Let me handle this!",
  ["2229404_8"]="The cat dashes off, with Xin closely trailing. They hurry out of the street, heading straight to the park.",
  ["2229404_9"]="Come on, Xin... Fighting with a cat, really?",
  ["2229405_1"]="Before everyone arrives, the cat finishes his meal, wagging his tail and leave.",
  ["2229406_1"]="Sorry, the cat slipped away...",
  ["2229406_2"]="Don't worry, it's not your fault. Let's wait for the cat's owner to put out more cat food and try again.",
  ["2229407_1"]="When Yuli reaches the park, panting, Xin and the cat are nowhere in sight. All that remains is an empty square with a large tree at its center.",
  ["2229407_2"]="H-have you seen Xin... or the cat, Azi?",
  ["2229407_3"]="Yeah, they're up there.",
  ["2229407_4"]="I can't believe it... She's actually following that cat up the tree.",
  ["2229408_1"]="Finally, we've caught this naughty cat... Huh? The branch—",
  ["2229408_10"]="Good to hear you're okay. Xin got the gear back.",
  ["2229408_2"]="In that moment, Yuli feels like time is stretching infinitely like a silk thread.",
  ["2229408_3"]="With disheveled hair and fluttering sleeves, her memories blend with reality.",
  ["2229408_4"]="I can't tell you how much I appreciate it, Yuli.",
  ["2229408_5"]="Thanks to you, I had such a wonderful Autumntide Festival in QingYu City.",
  ["2229408_6"]="If we get the chance next year, I'd love to stroll through the lantern show with you again...",
  ["2229408_7"]="...",
  ["2229408_8"]="Yuli? Are you... okay? You've been standing still lost in thought for a while.",
  ["2229408_9"]="I... I'm fine. I just... got lost in thoughts.",
  ["2229409_1"]="Xin... are you alright?",
  ["2229409_10"]="Yuli shakes her head as if having made a decision.",
  ["2229409_11"]="Thank you for inviting me, but... I'll pass.",
  ["2229409_12"]="I'm actually leaving this city soon.",
  ["2229409_13"]="What?!",
  ["2229409_2"]="I hope I didn't hurt you in the heat of the moment...",
  ["2229409_3"]="I'm fine, just a scratch. If I had fallen from the tree... Qing would probably give me an earful.",
  ["2229409_4"]="Oh, the gear is safe now. Just don't let that cat grab it again.",
  ["2229409_5"]="Yeah, I'll make sure it stays safe.",
  ["2229409_6"]="So, what's your next move, Yuli?",
  ["2229409_7"]="You've been stuck fixing puppets and sewing clothes all day. Isn't that a bit too dull?",
  ["2229409_8"]="How about exploring CangLin City with us? There's a new joint for hotpot in the western area. Let's give it a try, what do you say?",
  ["2229409_9"]="...",
  ["2229412_1"]="Yuli strokes the cat, who stretches out and purrs contentedly.",
  ["2229601_1"]="Are these puppets... belongings of Gu Tu?",
  ["2229601_2"]="No, they're much larger than usual puppets. They look like the ones that attacked the resident.",
  ["2229601_3"]="They've got burn marks. Could it be from the fire in my memory...?",
  ["2229601_4"]="Before she can delve deeper into thought, the puppets lurch forward, their eyes ablaze with fury and hatred.",
  ["2229601_5"]="Watch out. Those puppets are coming towards you.",
  ["2229601_6"]="I know.",
  ["2229602_1"]="The screen is all scratched up... There have been some intense battles fought here.",
  ["2229602_2"]="Yuli plucks some greenish fabric fibers from the screen for closer inspection.",
  ["2229602_3"]="Isn't this... the distinctive outfit of WeiShi?",
  ["2229602_4"]="Could one of the factions be from WeiShi?",
  ["2229603_1"]="This coffee table... looks familiar. I've definitely been here before.",
  ["2229603_2"]="A shadow crosses over Yuli's face.",
  ["2229603_3"]="This is where Gu Tu led me through, and we ended up on the rooftop...",
  ["2229603_4"]="What were you intending to do back then, Gu Tu?",
  ["2229604_1"]="Despite leaving no corner unturned, she has unearthed few clues except for one suspicious aspect.",
  ["2229604_2"]="Why are all these puppets targeting me?",
  ["2229604_3"]="Puppets are just like humans. Their emotions and desires are all guided by the strings of memories.",
  ["2229604_4"]="They're hostile towards you because someone has woven this animosity into them.",
  ["2229604_5"]="Yuli's gaze trails behind the puppets. As Sue mentioned, they are connected with almost imperceptible strings.",
  ["2229604_6"]="These strings are from behind the curtain.",
  ["2229604_7"]="Could it be...?",
  ["2229604_8"]="Contemplating this, Yuli can't help but tighten her grip on the strings in her hand.",
  ["2229604_9"]="If this is what you're hoping for, whatever it is, I'll face it.",
  ["2229706_1"]="As the main doors swing ajar, the ancient-style mansion unfolds before Yuli and Sue.",
  ["2229706_2"]="The furniture in the corridor is cloaked in dust, suggesting prolonged neglect.",
  ["2229706_3"]="The setup inside the house seems a bit peculiar. I think just heard gears turning.",
  ["2229706_4"]="Well, it was crafted by a puppetmaster, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are intricate mechanisms at play.",
  ["2229706_5"]="Maybe one of our ancestors built this to keep the nosy folks at bay.",
  ["2229706_6"]="That ancestor had quite the character.",
  ["2229706_7"]="The mansion likely holds traces of that ancestor's life. That bronze crane statue over there looks well-worn. Maybe we should start our investigation there.",
  ["2229707_1"]="Alright, this must be that ancestor's room.",
  ["2229709_1"]="It's odd. Why did the owner of this place put a black sword in the middle of the room, with scorch marks covering it?",
  ["2229709_2"]="This black sword... does have a story behind it.",
  ["2229709_3"]="A century ago in QingYu City, there was a lantern show tradition during the Autumntide Festival, where the whole area would light up with prayers for safe travels and family reunions.",
  ["2229709_4"]="Then, one year, a fierce fire erupted during the festival, destroying all that hope and prosperity.",
  ["2229709_5"]="How can this be...?",
  ["2229709_6"]="This sword was salvaged from the lantern show by that ancestor. The scorch marks likely serve as a somber reminder for future generations.",
  ["2229709_7"]="But that fire... it was just an accident, right? The ancestor was a victim, so why would he...?",
  ["2229709_8"]="Well, years have passed since that incident, and the truth remains buried.",
  ["2229709_9"]="Anyway, let's keep going... Upstairs are those bronze crane statues. Maybe they hold some clues.",
  ["2229710_1"]="This room houses numerous books on puppetry. Let's browse through them.",
  ["2229711_1"]="The bookcase is adorned with numerous ancient scrolls about puppetry, showcasing puppetry techniques.",
  ["2229711_2"]="\"The art of puppetry is a duality. One facet resides in form, demanding a meticulous exploration of artisanal techniques and an immersion in mechanical intricacies; the other dwells in mechanism, necessitating an appreciation of string choreography and the marvels of contraptions.\"",
  ["2229711_3"]="\"Practitioners of this art should must embody benevolence, avoid the mundane, and refrain from beguiling the world with intricate puppets. These are the tenets for puppetmasters.\"",
  ["2229711_4"]="The descriptions in these books align with Sue's teachings.",
  ["2229711_5"]="Puppetry is a profound art that must be handled with care and respect, never to be misused.",
  ["2229711_6"]="The mechanisms described in these books are fascinating. I had no idea puppetry had so many intricate aspects... I still have much to learn.",
  ["2229711_7"]="Oh, I got lost in my thoughts...",
  ["2229712_1"]="The bookshelf was lined with historical records, documenting events of the past.",
  ["2229712_2"]="\"...In the fall, a puppetmaster staged a show at the pavilion that drew a large audience. However, midway through the performance, all the puppets stopped moving and ignited, causing a fire on the stage. The flames quickly spread to the pavilion and lantern show. Despite efforts to extinguish the fire, the once luxurious structures were reduced to ash.\"",
  ["2229712_3"]="\"Puppetmasters, skilled in the art of puppetry, must handle their puppets with care to prevent disasters. Although the calamity has been quelled, the mastermind behind the incident remains unidentified, posing a potential threat. This bitter lesson serves as a grim reminder for us to remain vigilant and cautious in perpetuity...\"",
  ["2229712_4"]="So, the fire Sue mentioned earlier... was caused by another puppetmaster.",
  ["2229712_5"]="It seems that conflicts existed even among puppetmasters.",
  ["2229712_6"]="No wonder that ancestor felt guilty and placed that sword as a reminder.",
  ["2229712_7"]="...",
  ["2229712_8"]="What kind of puppetmaster was I before losing my memories?",
  ["2229713_1"]="The door is locked... Maybe I should return to the black sword and find another way out.",
  ["2229714_1"]="This door won't budge. I might need to find another way out.",
  ["2229715_1"]="While these books offer intriguing insights, they don't seem to relate to my past.",
  ["2229715_2"]="There seems to be something on the shelf over there... Let's check it out.",
  ["2229801_1"]="Have you recalled something just now, Yuli?",
  ["2229801_11"]="The scream comes from the mountainside.",
  ["2229801_13"]="Let's go check it out, Sue.",
  ["2229801_2"]="Lanterns swayed above them, evoking a sense of familiarity.",
  ["2229801_3"]="Yeah, it's coming back to me... I've been here before and made a promise to attend the lantern show with a girl.",
  ["2229801_4"]="She taught me the puppet show and a tale, and we even agreed to perform a puppet show together.",
  ["2229801_5"]="We had plans to meet here, but now... I can't find any signs of a recent lantern show at all.",
  ["2229801_6"]="...",
  ["2229801_7"]="Just as Sue is about to speak, a series of screams echoes from nearby.",
  ["2229801_8"]="Help! Please! Someone, help me!",
  ["2229801_9"]="Widening her eyes in astonishment, Yuli traces the source of the sound.",
  ["2229802_1"]="T-thank you for your help! If it wasn't for you, those dummies might have done me in!",
  ["2229802_2"]="(Weird, he doesn't seem to notice Sue's presence. Is this the \"Vision\" those WeiShi people mentioned?)",
  ["2229802_3"]="What exactly happened here? Why did those puppets suddenly attack you?",
  ["2229802_4"]="I've no idea... I was prepping for the Autumntide Festival, went to the storage for some props.",
  ["2229802_5"]="And out of the blue, those dummies stacked in the corner came to life and started coming after me!",
  ["2229802_6"]="Are those puppets... brought here from the mountain?",
  ["2229802_7"]="Yeah, exactly... Wait, what are you planning to do? You're not going to confront them directly, are you? That's far too risky!",
  ["2229802_8"]="But leaving them unchecked will only make things worse. Please lead the way.",
  ["2229803_1"]="This is the place. I'm hearing strange noises. Be careful, young lady!",
  ["2229803_2"]="Don't worry... It'll be over soon.",
  ["2229804_1"]="After an intense confrontation, the unruly puppets crumble to the ground.",
  ["2229804_2"]="You're quite the fighter! Can't believe you've managed to get rid of all of them!",
  ["2229804_3"]="Unaffected by the resident's praises, Yuli bends over, examining the destroyed puppets.",
  ["2229804_4"]="As she caresses the puppets' casings, an indescribable sorrow creeps up her spine. These puppets seem entwined with her own past.",
  ["2229804_5"]="Have you spotted similar puppets anywhere else?",
  ["2229804_6"]="Maybe in the warehouse to the east? These strange dummies popped out when I was moving stuff there...",
  ["2229804_7"]="I see. I'll head over and check things out.",
  ["2229805_1"]="As soon as Yuli pushes the wooden door open, the warehouse reverberates with the sound of turning gears.",
  ["2229805_2"]="The stooped puppets slowly turn towards Yuli as if anticipating her arrival.",
  ["2230101_11"]="I'm not sure why, but I could see a look of speechless resignation on Li Chi's face, one that mirrored my own.",
  ["2230101_12"]="Hey, welcome! Glad to have you at our live-streaming event!",
  ["2230101_13"]="Ahem, I initially wanted to invite Miss Azi to help us, but she seems quite busy recently.",
  ["2230101_14"]="What live stream?",
  ["2230101_15"]="Did Azi threaten you guys?",
  ["2230101_16"]="(Quickly covers face)",
  ["2230101_2"]="After a fierce battle, I had planned to take some time to rest and recover in Qingyu City. But then, one day, I received a message from the Tianli clan—they needed my help with something important.",
  ["2230101_20"]="You don't need to worry. We haven't started filming yet, and you won't even be on camera.",
  ["2230101_21"]="Now that Qingyu City is peaceful again, we can start welcoming visitors. I was thinking we could take this chance to do a livestream and bring in some revenue... maybe even attract more tourists.",
  ["2230101_22"]="As you know, our clan's patriarch might not have the best temperament or manners, but at least he's easy on the eyes and has a great face for the camera, so he's the real host here.",
  ["2230101_23"]="I don't know why, but I could've sworn Li Chi shot us a sharp glare.",
  ["2230101_24"]="How can you say we coerced him? It's actually a great opportunity for him to make a living from livestreaming.",
  ["2230101_25"]="How did you manage to coerce him?",
  ["2230101_26"]="This is unexpected.",
  ["2230101_27"]="Life's tough—Li Chi's doing performances now.",
  ["2230101_3"]="As I stepped into the Tianli ancestral home, I noticed a stall set up in the plaza, filled with various goods. Behind it stood Li Chi, wearing a grim expression, looking like a shady merchant ready to make a hard sell.",
  ["2230101_31"]="Money makes the world go 'round, after all.",
  ["2230101_32"]="Learning about the harsh realities of life is a must for someone his age. Otherwise, how would he understand the value of money and learn to respect the elders in his tribe?",
  ["2230101_33"]="Anyway, I promised him that if this livestream goes well, I'll give him one-third of the profits. Then he can buy whatever game cartridge he wants. Of course, we're not giving him all the money—most of it will be saved for him until he's older.",
  ["2230101_34"]="Ahem, let's just leave it at that. A kid like him won't be able to manage that much money anyway.",
  ["2230101_35"]="And then never give it back?",
  ["2230101_36"]="It's our responsibility to ensure the financial security of minors.",
  ["2230101_39"]="Nice, you get it!",
  ["2230101_4"]="...",
  ["2230101_40"]="But this live-streaming and product-selling thing is new for him. He still needs some expert advice. Right now, everyone's busy fixing up the ancestral home. Miss Azi said we could come to you for help since she thinks you have a good sense of the online world.",
  ["2230101_41"]="It's alright, don't worry, I'm here. Having extra hands means more support, so just take a breath.",
  ["2230101_42"]="But I've never live-streamed before.",
  ["2230101_43"]="I know a little.",
  ["2230101_44"]="Looks like you've found the right person.",
  ["2230101_48"]="That's alright. Anyway, I'm here, so we're good.",
  ["2230101_49"]="Reliable as always! We'll leave our clan's patriarch to you then!",
  ["2230101_5"]="...",
  ["2230101_50"]="Let me give you a brief rundown of the job. Basically, you'll be selecting the right bullet comments for our clan's patriarch to read, sparking interesting conversations during the livestream, and subtly slipping in our ads.",
  ["2230101_51"]="We've already prepped all the products we'll be showcasing; they're right around here. When it's time to showcase the products, we'll need you to move quickly and help our clan's patriarch fetch them.",
  ["2230101_52"]="Our leader isn't the best with words, so if the products don't show up on time, he might freeze up and not know what to say next. So, we'll need your help to make sure everything runs smoothly in that regard.",
  ["2230101_53"]="Now, let's get familiar with the products.",
  ["2230101_6"]="What's going on here?",
  ["2230101_7"]="No money, but you can take my life.",
  ["2230102_2"]="The Tianli people are skilled in many arts. Beyond their martial abilities, many Tianli people also excel in traditional painting and calligraphy. These pieces are examples of their antique-inspired works.",
  ["2230102_3"]="Perfect for gifts or for sprucing up your home.",
  ["2230103_1"]="Sweet and refreshing, this homemade Tianli rice wine has passed all the necessary official certifications and is now legally available for sale.",
  ["2230103_2"]="Not for minors.",
  ["2230104_1"]="A round lantern, adorned with intricate paper-cut designs, looks even better when it's spinning.",
  ["2230104_2"]="Great for indoor decoration.",
  ["2230105_1"]="A handcrafted red oiled-paper umbrella, radiating an elegance rarely found in modern umbrellas.",
  ["2230105_2"]="Great for rainy days or for use in photoshoots.",
  ["2230106_1"]="A square lantern adorned with traditional landscape paintings, exuding an elegant and dignified charm.",
  ["2230106_2"]="Best for outdoor decoration.",
  ["2230107_10"]="Alright, start by reading three or four bullet comments. The more engaging, the better. Then, slip the ads in whenever there's a chance.",
  ["2230107_11"]="Read bullet comments.",
  ["2230107_12"]="Grab a product.",
  ["2230107_13"]="Connecting in 3... 2... 1.",
  ["2230107_17"]="The stream's popularity will be shown as a progress bar at the top. Just make sure it doesn't drop to zero.",
  ["2230107_18"]="As for the rest, just trust the leader to figure it out... haha...",
  ["2230107_19"]="Live stream, action!",
  ["2230107_2"]="Did you get a good look at all the products? Pretty awesome, right? At the end of the day, just pick whatever you like—it's part of your payment.",
  ["2230107_20"]="I've got a bad feeling about this.",
  ["2230107_21"]="Better him than me.",
  ["2230107_22"]="It's for the the show, right? Alright, alright.",
  ["2230107_7"]="Alright, let's get down to business. Do you still remember what you need to do?",
  ["2230108_1"]="Hello, everyone! I'm your new host, Li Chi. Today, I'll be showcasing some of the traditional handicrafts from the Tianli clan...",
  ["2230108_10"]="Can people with sensitive skin use this?",
  ["2230108_11"]="We have landscapes, portraits, and depictions of flowers, birds, and insects. The ones behind me are part of our collection—feel free to take a look.",
  ["2230108_12"]="Buy two, get one free. If you buy five, we'll even offer a free customization service, where you can choose what you want in the painting.",
  ["2230108_13"]="I could tell Li Chi was stumped by this bullet comment, looking like an NPC getting a new quest, with a big question mark hovering above his head.",
  ["2230108_14"]="Ahem, it's time to—introduce our featured product.",
  ["2230108_17"]="Uh-oh, this isn't one of the \"shill's\" comments, but it's too late to take it back—Li Chi's already reading it out loud.",
  ["2230108_18"]="Rain? Yes, it's drizzling a little here, but I've got plenty of umbrellas!",
  ["2230108_19"]="Li Chi gave the introduction again, this time with more formality. Although his tone was still a bit stiff, it was a noticeable improvement over his earlier stammering.",
  ["2230108_2"]="I could tell that he's prepared a limited script, so he'd have to rely on reading the bullet comments to spice things up.",
  ["2230108_20"]="Is the rice wine strong?",
  ["2230108_21"]="Can the rice wine cure hemorrhoids?",
  ["2230108_23"]="It's clear that Li Chi anticipated this question; he answers smoothly. Soon, more questions start popping up in the chat.",
  ["2230108_24"]="Rice wine is a food product and doesn't have any medicinal properties. If you're looking for treatment, I recommend consulting a doctor.",
  ["2230108_25"]="Li Chi's expression, caught between the urge to snap and holding it back, amused the audience, drawing even more viewers into the livestream.",
  ["2230108_26"]="I think so. Our paper is made from natural materials, with no industrial additives.",
  ["2230108_27"]="He actually thought about this for a moment.",
  ["2230108_28"]="To ensure a smooth transition, we arranged for a \"shill\" in the chat to send comments. By choosing comments related to the umbrella, our plan would unfold seamlessly.",
  ["2230108_31"]="I'm so hungry.",
  ["2230108_32"]="Is it raining at the host's place?",
  ["2230108_33"]="\"I'm so hungry...\" Well, if you're hungry, you should use an umbrella! It looks like a mushroom and can help satisfy your cravings, filling you up with its whims.",
  ["2230108_34"]="Even worse, Li Chi doesn't have the flexibility to improvise. He's just rambling now.",
  ["2230108_35"]="Li Chi's awkward attempt at promoting products turned off some viewers, causing the stream's popularity to drop. Luckily, there's still a chance to turn things around.",
  ["2230108_37"]="Things are following the script now. Li Chi's face lights up, eager to sell everything and end this torturous live session.",
  ["2230108_38"]="Quick, grab an umbrella and hand it to him. Li Chi won't last much longer without it.",
  ["2230108_5"]="We have two types: fermented rice wine and aged rice wine. The latter has a higher alcohol content, so feel free to choose according to your preference.",
  ["2230108_6"]="When I sent this bullet comment to Li Chi, I saw him freeze for a moment, but for the sake of the show's popularity, he had no choice but to roll with it.",
  ["2230108_8"]="What kind of paintings do you have?",
  ["2230108_9"]="Are there any discounts?",
  ["2230109_1"]="I quickly hand him the umbrella, and he effortlessly begins to pitch it. The backend orders start rolling in, and the Tianli residents are ecstatic.",
  ["2230109_10"]="Can the lantern be used as a sky lantern?",
  ["2230109_11"]="Sorry, we're a small business. Once you confirm receipt, we don't accept returns. Please inspect the items for any damages before accepting the delivery.",
  ["2230109_12"]="Well, can't help you there, but you can always report it to the police.",
  ["2230109_13"]="Yeah, if you buy more than one, you can tie them together to make a hot air balloon!",
  ["2230109_15"]="Is the rice wine fresh?",
  ["2230109_16"]="Is it possible for me not to buy it?",
  ["2230109_17"]="Can I drink rice wine without opening my mouth?",
  ["2230109_18"]="It's fresh. It can last up to a year in a sealed container. Once opened, it's best to finish it within three months.",
  ["2230109_19"]="Of course. You could even sit in my spot on the livestream if you want.",
  ["2230109_20"]="Sure, you could absorb the rice wine through your skin once it evaporates.",
  ["2230109_22"]="How did you know I'm about to go on a world tour?",
  ["2230109_23"]="How did you know I moved to a new place?",
  ["2230109_24"]="Uh-oh, this comment looks way too much like one of our \"shill\" comments. I accidentally clicked the wrong one.",
  ["2230109_25"]="Moved into a new place? Well, you'll definitely need some home decor, and we have just the items for you!",
  ["2230109_26"]="That's more like it! Quickly, get those paintings and lanterns before it's too late.",
  ["2230109_27"]="I'll go grab more stock from the warehouse. You all keep things rolling, alright?",
  ["2230109_28"]="After the Tianli Resident left, I selected a few more engaging bullet comments.",
  ["2230109_29"]="Can that light be put on a car as a police siren?",
  ["2230109_30"]="Do the lanterns work with electricity",
  ["2230109_31"]="I could tell that Lichi was finally getting used to the trolling comments in the livestream chat. That's a good sign.",
  ["2230109_32"]="Sure, I can even have a dance party with it in the bathroom.",
  ["2230109_33"]="I suddenly felt relieved—looks like the Tianli resident was right—Li Chi really is good at figuring things out on his own!",
  ["2230109_34"]="Li Chi was really getting the hang of it. Our viewership and sales were skyrocketing. It seemed like it was time for the next step...",
  ["2230109_35"]="Now, it was time to pitch the decorative paintings and round lanterns for home decor.",
  ["2230109_36"]="Oh well, there's no going back. I can only hope that Li Chi, now more familiar with livestreaming, can handle this smoothly.",
  ["2230109_37"]="\"World tour\"... Speaking of travel, of course, you can't travel without a lantern! It gets so dark outside without one...",
  ["2230109_38"]="Li Chi, I'm so disappointed in you! That was a painfully awkward pitch, and we lost some popularity because of it.",
  ["2230109_39"]="Quick, grab the paintings and lanterns before more viewers leave!",
  ["2230109_5"]="...",
  ["2230109_6"]="It's electrically powered. No need for candles, and there's no safety hazard.",
  ["2230109_8"]="Is there a warranty service?",
  ["2230109_9"]="My friend used one of your umbrellas for skydiving and got injured. Can I get compensation?",
  ["2230110_1"]="We managed to sell a good number of items this round. Now, we just need to wrap things up and build the hype for the next round. But Li Chi's looking pretty worn out.",
  ["2230110_10"]="What do you like to do in your free time, host?",
  ["2230110_11"]="Do you have any special talents?",
  ["2230110_13"]="Great! He's already figuring out how to leverage his own strengths.",
  ["2230110_15"]="It seems like the Tianli people put on song and dance shows for visitors every year. I thought I was just picking a regular comment, but it looks like I touched a nerve.",
  ["2230110_16"]="I realized only later that, for a teenager, dancing in front of an audience is probably super embarrassing—especially when it gets dug up online, and now it's happening live during his stream.",
  ["2230110_17"]="I'm back... Huh? What's going on? Why is the clan patriarch silent?",
  ["2230110_18"]="The Tianli resident glanced at the backstage monitor and saw the comment. His face instantly paled.",
  ["2230110_19"]="Ahhh, why did you have to bring that up?! Wait, leader, where are you going? The stream isn't over yet—don't leave!",
  ["2230110_2"]="Let's steer away from product talk and pick a lighthearted topic to give him a breather.",
  ["2230110_20"]="Li Chi slammed the \"End Broadcast\" button and bolted. The stream froze on its final frame, but by then, he had already vanished like a shooting star, fleeing the scene.",
  ["2230110_21"]="I'm guessing Li Chi probably won't be streaming again anytime soon. This time, he's truly learned how harsh the world can be...",
  ["2230110_22"]="Li Chi ran off under the setting sun, with the Tianli residents and me chasing after him. The scattered goods left in his wake mirrored the fragments of the young man's broken heart.",
  ["2230110_5"]="Me? I love playing games, and... I also play the flute.",
  ["2230110_6"]="If I get 100,000 followers, I'll play the flute for you all!",
  ["2230110_8"]="Can you dance? I saw you dance in Qingyu City once.",
  ["2230110_9"]="...",
  ["2230111_1"]="Wrong item, that's not it. Let's look again.",
  ["2230112_1"]="There it is! Let's head back and report to Li Chi.",
  ["2230113_1"]="Oh no, I wasn't fast enough! The momentum I'd built by reading the comments has fizzled out, and now the livestream feels cold again.",
  ["2230113_2"]="How did this happen? Are all our efforts about to go down the drain? I can't let that happen...",
  ["2230113_3"]="Let's try again. This time, we'll make it work!",
  ["2230114_1"]="We're still missing one more item. Let's see if we can find something else that's perfect for indoor decor.",
  ["2230115_1"]="Got everything! Time to bring them all back to Li Chi.",
  ["2230116_1"]="Oh no, I wasn't fast enough! The momentum I'd built by reading the comments has fizzled out, and now the livestream feels cold again.",
  ["2230116_2"]="How did this happen? Are all our efforts about to go down the drain? I can't let that happen...",
  ["2230116_3"]="Let's try again. This time, we'll make it work!",
  ["2230117_1"]="Uh... ahem... I... I'm the new streamer, L-L-Li Chi...",
  ["2230117_10"]="It's painfully obvious that he's stiffened up. His forced smile looks more like a grimace, as if he's being made to do this against his will.",
  ["2230117_11"]="This won't do. I need to pick some comments for him to read to break this awkward atmosphere.",
  ["2230117_12"]="What's the story behind the jewelry you're wearing?",
  ["2230117_13"]="Streamer, do a flower-hand wave for us!",
  ["2230117_14"]="Tianli silver ornaments date back to totem worship. The patterns are fixed and connected to ancient myths.",
  ["2230117_15"]="For example, this one, it tells the story of...",
  ["2230117_16"]="Once Li Chi stopped stuttering, the stream became a lot livelier, and more comments started coming in.",
  ["2230117_17"]="Ah, that's right! Keep it up! Let's keep the momentum going!",
  ["2230117_18"]="I... I'm not very coordinated, so I'd rather not make a fool of myself.",
  ["2230117_19"]="As Li Chi lost his composure, the viewers in the livestream began jeering. Laughter filled the room, and the stream's popularity soared beyond anyone's anticipation.",
  ["2230117_2"]="Leader, why are you stammering? Didn't we practice this so many times already?",
  ["2230117_21"]="Alright, that was just a warm-up. Let's get down to business now!",
  ["2230117_22"]="Can't believe this actually worked...",
  ["2230117_23"]="Don't blame me for going all out.",
  ["2230117_5"]="The moment Li Chi was asked about something familiar, he noticeably relaxed. His face became less tense, and his words flowed more smoothly.",
  ["2230117_6"]="As soon as I selected this comment, I realized I'd messed up. With Li Chi's personality, he would never do something so embarrassing in front of everyone. Sure enough, I was met with a look of shock and reproach from him.",
  ["2230117_7"]="But the button's already pressed. Now Li Chi has no choice but to wing it.",
  ["2230117_8"]="I could barely watch, but honestly, Li Chi's the one who got the short end of the stick here.",
  ["2230117_9"]="Today, I'm here to... show you... the... traditional handicrafts of our Tianli Tribe...",
  ["2230201_1"]="Is this... a new streamer? (⊙ｏ⊙)\
Hello to everyone in the livestream!\

  ["2231101_1"]="Hey, you there...",
  ["2231101_2"]="Hey, it's you, Li Chi. What made you decide to go out today?",
  ["2231101_3"]="Am I really that rare of a sight, taking a stroll around?",
  ["2231101_4"]="You've been buried in books or honing your sword skills every single day. I haven't noticed you slipping off to the mountains with those troublemakers lately.",
  ["2231101_5"]="How did you find out about that...?",
  ["2231101_6"]="Everyone knows that. Maybe the elder just didn't want to scold you for sneaking off.",
  ["2231101_7"]="...",
  ["2231102_1"]="Grandpa, I want to go outside the mountain!",
  ["2231102_2"]="Ah, don't say it again... We Tianli people are not allowed to leave Mount Tianque. It's part of our ancestral creed, you know?",
  ["2231102_3"]="Can't you be more like Li Chi and take your studies seriously?!",
  ["2231102_4"]="(Since when did I become a role model...?)",
  ["2231102_5"]="(Alright, I should probably not embarrass myself...)",
  ["2231103_1"]="And stop calling me \"young patriarch.\"",
  ["2231103_2"]="Thank you.",
  ["2231103_3"]="We were busy with the lawn, so we didn't pay much attention. Why not check the path near the front yard?",
  ["2231103_4"]="So, they didn't wait for you today?",
  ["2231103_5"]="...",
  ["2231103_6"]="Ah, good morning, our young patriarch.",
  ["2231103_7"]="Hey there, have you seen the guys I usually hang out with?",
  ["2231104_1"]="So, seems like they've gone to the mountains.",
  ["2231104_10"]="I didn't... Did I sigh? I have so much clan work to do, no time for sighing.",
  ["2231104_11"]="Instinctively, Li Chi crosses his arms but quickly lowers them, remembering to show respect to the elder.",
  ["2231104_12"]="I'm glad you understand.",
  ["2231104_13"]="You've taken on more clan responsibilities lately. It's not an easy job.",
  ["2231104_14"]="Even though you're not officially the patriarch yet, don't slack off. Follow the rules and lead by example, okay?",
  ["2231104_15"]="Observing Li Chi's hesitation and aimless pacing, the elder seems to realize something.",
  ["2231104_16"]="So, where were you headed? Into the mountains to mine?",
  ["2231104_17"]="Oh... yeah, I thought I could find some ore up there.",
  ["2231104_18"]="Nonsense!",
  ["2231104_19"]="We have plenty of ore in the warehouse for practice.",
  ["2231104_2"]="Well, can't blame them. Who wouldn't want to take a walk in the mountains on such a lovely day?",
  ["2231104_20"]="Remember how you used to sneak into the forge, demanding a sword for yourself when you were a child? Now you can practice in the room for real, but you're trying to slack off.",
  ["2231104_21"]="What's so interesting about the mountains, I wonder?",
  ["2231104_22"]="Caught off guard, Li Chi awkwardly scratches his head.",
  ["2231104_23"]="Well, elder... I just wanted to take a look around there.",
  ["2231104_24"]="I noticed some footprints at the entrance, thinking my friends might be sneak out to play around there.",
  ["2231104_25"]="After all, that place is quite sacred to the Tianli clan, so I'll go bring them back in a few.",
  ["2231104_26"]="Oh, you think I'll fall for that?",
  ["2231104_27"]="Weren't you the first one to sneak onto the sacred lands and lead them there?",
  ["2231104_28"]="I've known you since you were a kid. You've always been a troublemaker, you know?",
  ["2231104_29"]="The elder taps his cane and waves his hand, as if recalling a memory.",
  ["2231104_3"]="Murmuring to himself, he stands, lightly steps across the eaves, and lands softly on the mountain path.",
  ["2231104_30"]="It's natural for you young ones to be playful. Just don't try to fool me with fancy words like \"sacred lands.\"",
  ["2231104_31"]="Don't forget your duties.",
  ["2231104_32"]="The patriarch's inauguration is coming up, and you're the one facing those three trials.",
  ["2231104_33"]="Don't embarrass yourself and bring shame to our clan for ages to come.",
  ["2231104_34"]="Aware of his mistake, Li Chi feels too embarrassed to make excuses.",
  ["2231104_35"]="Oh, please... If others caught wind of that, they'd think even less of me.",
  ["2231104_36"]="By the way, maybe it's just me, but ever since I became the patriarch's successor, my friends seem to be avoiding me...",
  ["2231104_37"]="Li Chi mutters in hesitation.",
  ["2231104_38"]="What's more important, getting ready for the inauguration or goofing off with your pals? Don't you know the answer deep down?",
  ["2231104_39"]="This is the most crucial matter for our clan. It sets our path for the next few decades.",
  ["2231104_4"]="He is determined to sneak into the mountains for some peace and quiet. If he delays any longer, he risks getting caught by the elder and receiving a good scolding.",
  ["2231104_40"]="We have to stick to our ancestral rules. This isn't just about picking someone young to run errands; it's serious business!",
  ["2231104_41"]="If they don't show respect, how can you expect others to see you as the patriarch?",
  ["2231104_42"]="Of course, the inauguration is more important...",
  ["2231104_43"]="...But those friend problems need sorting out too.",
  ["2231104_44"]="His casual remark prompts a stern lecture from the elder, though Li Chi shows no sign of backing down.",
  ["2231104_45"]="You just never seem to learn!",
  ["2231104_46"]="Forget it, I'll act like I didn't see anything.",
  ["2231104_47"]="With a tap on the ground, the elder turns around and departs, leaving Li Chi standing there alone.",
  ["2231104_48"]="Was that old man mad at me again?",
  ["2231104_49"]="I didn't misbehave or neglect my duties. Why was he so upset?",
  ["2231104_5"]="Just as Li Chi is about to take action, a gruff voice calls out behind him. The tone is faint, yet carries a sense of displeasure.",
  ["2231104_51"]="Or... did I say something wrong?",
  ["2231104_6"]="Li. Chi.",
  ["2231104_7"]="Startled, he turns around. The elder behind him must have been observing him from a distance for some time—how else could he appear at the exact moment Li Chi tries to leave?",
  ["2231104_8"]="Well.",
  ["2231104_9"]="What's with the sigh?",
  ["2231105_1"]="Where is everyone? Have they all gone off to the mountains?",
  ["2231105_10"]="Possibly feeling left out, he appears anxious, pacing along the eaves for a while before standing in place, his mind evidently wandering far beyond the courtyard.",
  ["2231105_11"]="Ah... spending all day practicing swordplay, with no one to chat with. It's so boring!",
  ["2231105_12"]="Maybe I should ask around to see if anyone has seen those guys around.",
  ["2231105_8"]="Is it just me, or has everyone been avoiding me lately?",
  ["2231105_9"]="Sitting on the rooftop, Li Chi looks out into the distance. At first glance, he seems mature, but a closer look reveals a hint of youthful innocence in his eyes.",
  ["2231106_1"]="...Snakes?",
  ["2231106_2"]="You're in trouble now. I'm coming to deal with you.",
  ["2231107_1"]="That voice, it's them.",
  ["2231107_2"]="The recent rainy days brought out all kinds of critters.",
  ["2231107_3"]="It's not a big deal, but I should talk to my pals about it.",
  ["2231109_1"]="I've got to remind everyone to watch out during the snake season.",
  ["2231109_2"]="I need to take them back and make some snake-catching tools.",
  ["2231109_3"]="I wonder where they've disappeared to... Maybe I should check with other people a little bit more.",
  ["2231201_1"]="Hmm, this looks promising. Could make good grinding material.",
  ["2231202_1"]="Tsk, this stone is tough. Should've brought those mining tools.",
  ["2231203_1"]="This Cerulean Crystal looks amazing! Perfect for crafting the edge!",
  ["2231204_1"]="These materials should be more than enough to forge a decent blade.",
  ["2231204_2"]="I should head back now before I get scolded again.",
  ["2231205_1"]="The slopes are steep here... Where could these snakes be coming from?",
  ["2231205_2"]="They can't be sprouting out of the mountains, can they?",
  ["2231205_3"]="Something felt off when I cut those snakes... Their scales felt slippery, almost like the texture of the Cerulean Crystal.",
  ["2231205_4"]="Something is definitely not right.",
  ["2231205_5"]="I should catch some for further study.",
  ["2231301_1"]="Hey, everyone, those snakes are pretty dangerous. Can I lend a hand?",
  ["2231301_10"]="Those snakes are in different locations. First one, along the cliff's edge.",
  ["2231301_2"]="Hey! It's you, Li Chi! Shouldn't you be working on your blade right now?",
  ["2231301_3"]="There's an urgent situation, and I can't just ignore it.",
  ["2231301_4"]="Dealing with those snakes isn't a walk in the park. Without me, someone could get hurt.",
  ["2231301_5"]="Come on! We're all Tianli clan members, following in the footsteps of Li Jun!",
  ["2231301_6"]="We've dealt with those snakes, but these eggs are quite a trouble. Go ask them and see how you can help.",
  ["2231301_7"]="Got it.",
  ["2231301_8"]="And lastly, under this walkway.",
  ["2231301_9"]="Second one is right on the cliff.",
  ["2231302_1"]="What the...? Am I seeing things?",
  ["2231302_2"]="Seeing what?",
  ["2231302_3"]="Huh? Oh, it's you, Li Chi! I thought I saw a massive snake, nearly as tall as a person, slithering down the mountain along the path.",
  ["2231302_4"]="But now that I think about it, how could that be... I must have been mistaken.",
  ["2231302_5"]="Let's stay alert. I'll scout ahead and see what's up.",
  ["2231303_1"]="What a pain. How did these snakes get here in the first place?",
  ["2231303_2"]="Are you free, Li Chi? Can you give me a hand with these snake eggs?",
  ["2231303_3"]="These snake eggs look peculiar, almost like they're growing on the mountain. Can you come and check them out?",
  ["2231303_4"]="Sure, leave them to me. I'll handle them later.",
  ["2231303_5"]="(A hassle indeed...)",
  ["2231304_1"]="Li... Li Chi!",
  ["2231304_2"]="What's going on?",
  ["2231304_3"]="A snake!",
  ["2231304_4"]="Yeah, I know there are snakes around, and everyone's dealing with them.",
  ["2231304_5"]="They're just small snakes. Why the fuss?",
  ["2231304_6"]="No, I mean there's a really... really massive snake! It could devour people whole, I'm telling you.",
  ["2231304_7"]="Maybe you're just too tired. Head back home and get some rest.",
  ["2231305_1"]="With multiple witnesses, that giant snake must be real.",
  ["2231305_2"]="I should ask others to head back and stay put until I handle that huge snake.",
  ["2231305_3"]="Wait, Li Chi... Behind you!",
  ["2231305_4"]="!",
  ["2231305_5"]="Heh, great! Now you're asking for this!",
  ["2231306_1"]="Why are you still standing there? Go grab the cage!",
  ["2231306_2"]="Oh, right... sure thing!",
  ["2231306_3"]="The giant snake, now trapped in a wooden cage, lies motionless.",
  ["2231307_1"]="This cage looks like it's about to fall apart...",
  ["2231307_2"]="Is it really safe to lock up such a huge snake in this rickety cage?",
  ["2231307_3"]="Don't we have any iron cages here?",
  ["2231307_4"]="We'll go find one!",
  ["2231307_5"]="Hurry up... Let's hope this cage holds together a bit longer.",
  ["2231401_1"]="In ancient times, the Lord of the Weaponry's legacy led subsequent generations of clansmen to vie for replication. Although none have truly captured the essence of the original Zhupi, the replicas from various craftsmen families showcase unique artistry...",
  ["2231401_2"]="It seems there are copies here besides the original Zhupi.",
  ["2231401_3"]="Hmm, so which one is the real Zhupi, then?",
  ["2231403_1"]="Huh? What's happening?",
  ["2231403_2"]="The disk containing the blade starts rotating.",
  ["2231403_3"]="Did I accidentally trigger this mechanism by touching the screen?",
  ["2231403_4"]="It looks like I need to stop it; otherwise, I won't be able to get the blade.",
  ["2231404_1"]="To safeguard our clan's most cherished treasure from falling into unworthy hands, craftsmen installed a protective disk beneath the blade. If unintentionally activated by our clan members... Keep in mind, in the location where poisonous snakes reside, the antidote can always be located within seven steps.",
  ["2231404_2"]="In the location where poisonous snakes reside, the antidote can always be located within seven steps. So, the mechanism to stop it should be nearby.",
  ["2231404_3"]="Honestly, I get the concern about safeguarding the blade, but placing the deactivator so close...",
  ["2231404_4"]="Let's hope the next leader simplifies these unnecessary complexities.",
  ["2231405_1"]="A blade possesses its unique essence, intolerant of counterfeits. When the authentic Zhupi manifests, the fake will stir. If genuine and imitation blades are stored together, caution is necessary to avert potential mishaps.",
  ["2231405_3"]="When the authentic Zhupi manifests, the fake will stir. Seriously? Can the real Zhupi influence the fake ones?",
  ["2231405_4"]="Maybe the ancestors were exaggerating a bit.",
  ["2231405_5"]="Yet here we are, with the real Zhupi beside a fake one... Now this is getting interesting.",
  ["2231405_6"]="I need to figure out how to separate the real from the fake so they can't \"see\" each other.",
  ["2231405_7"]="Perhaps just sheathing the blade will do the trick.",
  ["2400101_1"]="A haze clouds my mind",
  ["2400101_10"]="Even when I close my eyes, the endless darkness won't let go.",
  ["2400101_11"]="Ah, forget it...",
  ["2400101_12"]="The Tower of Babel has fallen...",
  ["2400101_13"]="It is...",
  ["2400101_14"]="None of it matters anymore...",
  ["2400101_15"]="In the depths of this foggy consciousness, a crack begins to form—a crack called \"Nothingness\".",
  ["2400101_16"]="My thoughts, like drops of water sinking into the sea, slowly begin to dissolve.",
  ["2400101_17"]="Just as my thoughts are about to vanish completely, a faint light flickers before me.",
  ["2400101_18"]="Tattered pages and book fragments drifted through the air.",
  ["2400101_19"]="Ah, it must be some unfortunate ancient book",
  ["2400101_2"]="I can't remember when or how I arrived here.",
  ["2400101_20"]="destroyed along with the library by Aten's explosion, now lost in this sea of darkness...",
  ["2400101_21"]="Just like I am now.",
  ["2400101_22"]="With this thought, my eyes drift instinctively toward the fluttering fragments.",
  ["2400101_23"]="...!",
  ["2400101_24"]="Countless images rush into my mind.",
  ["2400101_25"]="Within the fragments of the book, memories of unforgettable past events begin to reflect back at me.",
  ["2400101_26"]="That traitor!",
  ["2400101_27"]="Ere...",
  ["2400101_28"]="Why would she do such a thing?",
  ["2400101_29"]="The anger of betrayal, the sorrow of facing one's fate, and the confusion of helplessness.",
  ["2400101_3"]="All I know is that by the time I regained consciousness, the blinding light and scorching heat that engulfed I had long faded, leaving only silence where the sound of the crumbling tower once echoed.",
  ["2400101_30"]="As I reflect on everything that has happened so far, the fading thoughts become clearer, stirred by a mix of emotions.",
  ["2400101_31"]="I instinctively reach out, trying to grab one of the falling fragments.",
  ["2400101_32"]="The pieces, as if responding to my will, drift gently into my palm.",
  ["2400101_33"]="In the faint light, a familiar figure could be vaguely seen—",
  ["2400101_34"]="...No.",
  ["2400101_35"]="The figure before me is not the same as I remember. She now appears lighter... and even more lost.",
  ["2400101_36"]="The pages of the ancient book flutter rapidly beneath her fingertips.",
  ["2400101_37"]="The paper, fragile as time itself, crumbles with each turn, disintegrating into nothing.",
  ["2400101_38"]="Strangely, though the words on the pages are unfamiliar, their meaning is perfectly clear to me.",
  ["2400101_39"]="Gradually, my body begins to feel as though it's becoming part of the book, becoming ethereal.",
  ["2400101_4"]="Everywhere I look, there is nothing but darkness.",
  ["2400101_40"]="With a deep breath, I close my eyes and surrender entirely to the fragment in my hand...",
  ["2400101_5"]="I can't resist it.",
  ["2400101_6"]="Like drifting dust falling from a tower, all I feel is the sensation of a faint, endless descent.",
  ["2400101_7"]="I can't break free.",
  ["2400101_8"]="No matter how much I struggle, the suffocating emptiness clings onto me, holding me captive.",
  ["2400101_9"]="I can't find rest.",
  ["3201101_1"]="H-help! Someone help! Ereshan, Viola, Shamash... anyone... just help me!",
  ["32019101_1"]="Who are you?\

  ["3205101_1"]="Hurry up and activate this magnifying glass!",
  ["3205101_2"]="Let's see what our librarians were studying in the past!",
  ["3205102_1"]="Here comes the projection!",
  ["3205102_2"]="Is that an Eme-an from the past?",
  ["3205103_1"]="Hmm, strange... where's all the celestial data I asked Travis to organize?",
  ["3205103_2"]="I should check the research room upstairs.",
  ["3205104_1"]="That's not the correct password. Try exploring the <color=#fec66b>projection of the past.</color>",
  ["3205105_1"]="To find the answer, we'll have to find that <color=#fec66b>star</color>",
  ["3205106_1"]="The water-cooling system, the copper-core turntable, and the multiplexed pulleys... all these drawings were left behind by that silly librarian.",
  ["3205106_2"]="Looks like he put some serious effort into this machine.",
  ["3205107_1"]="There's too much stuff on the desk. What is even useful here?",
  ["3205107_2"]="Since this is Tuttle's work desk, why don't you just <color=#fec66b>ask him</color>?",
  ["3205108_1"]="Finally... with this heat-resistant steam oven, the difference engine will run for an incredibly long time.",
  ["3205108_2"]="Oh, so the steam oven is the only useful thing on the table.",
  ["3205109_1"]="Great! Steam oven, check!",
  ["3205201_1"]="Now, I'm a member of the Astronomical Society.",
  ["3205201_2"]="And I'm one step closer to finding that answer.",
  ["3205202_1"]="A year or two? He was pretty confident in this difference engine he built...",
  ["3205202_2"]="Never mind, let's see what he left behind back then.",
  ["3205203_1"]="The crate is locked. Let's <color=#fec66b>check out these bookshelves</color> before we give it another shot.",
  ["3205204_1"]="Great, we've got all the info we need. Go ahead and open that crate on the table.",
  ["3205205_1"]="The Astronomy Encyclopedia, astronomical measurements, and celestial motion simulated with a difference engine...",
  ["3205205_2"]="I'm getting more and more curious about the question Tuttle was working on.",
  ["3205205_3"]="Whatever he was working on, the technological breakthroughs he anticipated never came.",
  ["3205205_4"]="Both the theory and applications of difference engines reached their limits of development within a few years.",
  ["3205205_5"]="The knowledge and technology of that era weren't enough to provide him with the answers he sought.",
  ["3205206_1"]="Tuttle realized that the calculations would take much longer than he initially estimated.",
  ["3205206_2"]="Long enough to surpass the rest of his life.",
  ["3205301_1"]="Well, this is the observatory, the place where Tuttle spent his final days.",

  ["3214101_1"]="How is it moving so fast?!",
  ["3214102_1"]="Tsk, it waits for us to catch up just to run away again?!",
  ["3214102_2"]="It seems to be observing its surroundings.",
  ["3214103_1"]="Finally, we can get rid of this guy.",
  ["3215101_1"]="<color=#fec66b>Attack the switch</color> to deactivate the trap.",
  ["3215102_1"]="Who thought it was a genius idea to set up so many deadly traps around their office?",
  ["3215102_2"]="Maybe the guy just really loves his job?",
  ["3215102_3"]="...",
  ["3215103_1"]="Why don't we just smash these traps?",
  ["3215103_2"]="These traps are made with extremely sturdy materials so that invaders can't easily destroy them.",
  ["3215103_3"]="They can't be completely destroyed. Even if we attack them, they will only be <color=#fec66b>temporarily inert</color> and reactivate soon after.",
  ["3215103_4"]="Tsk.",
  ["3216101_1"]="An Immortal Army soldier? But why is he alone here?",
  ["3216101_2"]="There are too many monsters. He can't hold out much longer.",
  ["3216101_3"]="Tsk.",
  ["3217101_1"]="The next obstacle is right above the evacuation point. Let's head straight there.",
  ["3217102_1"]="The block on the left is the final one. Let's tackle it together.",
  ["3217201_1"]="Get. Away. From. Me.",
  ["3217201_2"]="Right now... I'm really itching to let off some steam!",
  ["3217202_1"]="Tsk, we just fought off those beasts, and now they're making a comeback!",
  ["3217202_2"]="And they've even brought reinforcements!",
  ["3217203_1"]="Heck! When did so many beasts gather here?",
  ["3217203_2"]="You annoying beasts... Get out of my way!",
  ["3217401_2"]="Why are there so many beasts by the entrance? Hmm... Maybe we can use the sound of Cerulean Crystal to lure them away?",
  ["3217402_1"]="Darn it, we alerted them! Now they're all coming this way... Seems like we're left with no other option. Let's take them down!",
  ["3217601_1"]="These pesky rocks are just everywhere... All the beasts in this area have been drawn in!",
  ["3217602_1"]="Come to me, you ugly monsters!",
  ["3217603_1"]="Okay, every beast within ten miles must be on my tail now...",
  ["3217603_2"]="Good, now it's time for a good old brawl!",
  ["3217801_1"]="Look... there's the red-haired girl!",
  ["3217801_2"]="Hold on! Let's clear the beasts ahead first.",
  ["3219101_1"]="Let's see what others think of this.",
  ["3219102_1"]="Hmmm, it's time to head back now.",
  ["3219103_1"]="Gotcha!",
  ["3219104_1"]="Looks like someone's coming our way.",
  ["3219106_1"]="Let's stick to the path and search for those ingenia parts.",
  ["3219107_1"]="That dummy...",
  ["3219108_1"]="There are quite a few dummies... I mean, ingenia, up ahead.",
  ["3219109_1"]="Did you hear that?",
  ["3219110_1"]="Sounds like more people are gathering now.",
  ["3219111_1"]="Let's make it harder. Try hitting the target that flips at a farther distance.",
  ["3219112_1"]="Let's raise the stakes. The target will start moving now.",
  ["3219113_1"]="Now the target will move while flipping. Time to show off our skills!",
  ["3219114_1"]="Ugh, those live comments are blocking my view!",
  ["3219114_2"]="Don't worry. I'll block them for you.",
  ["3219115_1"]="Someone over there looks like they need a hand.",
  ["3219116_1"]="You can use the nearby ingenia now!",
  ["3220102_1"]="The gate's opening!",
  ["3220103_1"]="The exit's blocked... I need to use the elevator to go around.",
  ["3220104_1"]="If I remember right, the elevator here needs those lights for guidance, too.",
  ["3220105_1"]="Elevator activated!",
  ["3220108_1"]="It's getting dark. I should turn on the streetlights along the way.",
  ["3220201_1"]="Let's start by checking the electrical box...",
  ["3220202_1"]="It's just a typical circuit issue. She's overreacting...",
  ["3220203_1"]="Whoa!",
  ["3220203_2"]="That was close.",
  ["3220203_3"]="I need to find that kid quickly.",
  ["3220301_1"]="Help!",
  ["3220301_2"]="I need to get rid of the animals outside.",
  ["3220302_1"]="Hmm? Why is she outside?",
  ["3220304_1"]="Nope, wrong way... At least he didn't run into any trouble here.",
  ["3220305_1"]="Ancestors, please! Clear this mist!",
  ["3220306_1"]="The mist is getting thicker... and those animals seem more agitated...",
  ["3220306_2"]="I need to pick up the pace.",
  ["3220307_1"]="The mist lights are almost there.",
  ["3220401_1"]="Are these animals... attracted to this cerulean water?",
  ["3220401_2"]="I've seen similar water in that well before...",
  ["3220402_1"]="These agitated animals... could further damage the catwalk.",
  ["3220402_2"]="No wonder the catwalk keeps getting damaged.",
  ["3220501_1"]="Let's get those lights back on.",
  ["3220502_1"]="Eggs, crystals, and roadblocks... I need to clear them all.",
  ["3220504_1"]="Now that the road is clear, I should go back and inform the driver.",
  ["3221101_1"]="Let's head down there.",
  ["3221102_1"]="The filter cartridge is upstairs. Let's go up and find it.",
  ["3221103_1"]="Got the spare filter cartridge. Let's give it to Viola.",
  ["3221201_1"]="Come on, Nanna. Don't hold back on me!",
  ["3221201_2"]="Get ready! This is going to be exciting!",
  ["3221301_1"]="I'll take the lead. Stick with me.",
  ["3221302_1"]="Oh, it seems she's activated the mechanical guards as well.",
  ["3221302_2"]="Well, we'll have to deal with them first.",
  ["3221303_1"]="Looks like these guards are seeing us as intruders.",
  ["3221303_2"]="I'll handle them. You handle the cake.",
  ["3221304_1"]="We need to take out those mechanisms... Maybe we can use the turret somehow?",
  ["3221304_2"]="We can move forward once the defense system here. is down",
  ["3221305_1"]="Just as I thought, the turrets in the central room are active too.",
  ["3221305_2"]="The defense system needs some maintenance and have operation rights secured...",
  ["3221401_1"]="These lights are blinking in a specific order...",
  ["3221401_2"]="I think we should copy the order in which they light up.",
  ["3221402_1"]="Another set of lights... I need to memorize their order.",
  ["3221403_1"]="I'm starting to get the hang of navigating these endless rooms...",
  ["3221403_2"]="Hopefully, we can finally make our way out, right?",
  ["3222201_1"]="Help! Anyone there? Help us!",
  ["3222202_1"]="Watch out, hero! These beasts are fierce!",
  ["3222203_1"]="They are way tougher than I expected...",
  ["3222301_1"]="One wave down. Two more to go.",
  ["3222302_1"]="Good, keep it up.",
  ["3222303_1"]="Last round. Take a breather once you're finished.",
  ["3222304_1"]="How are you feeling now, Wushi?",
  ["3222401_1"]="The ape is quick and tricky. Don't let it outwit you.",
  ["3222402_1"]="The tortoise has a strong shell. Be cautious not to break your edges.",
  ["3222403_1"]="Predicting a snake's movements is easier said than done.",
  ["3223101_1"]="It's all my fault. I shouldn't have gone fishing today... If I hadn't, I wouldn't have come back empty-handed...",
  ["3224101_1"]="Oh no, I totally forgot, I've got soup on the stove! If I don't turn it off now, it'll burn!",
  ["3225201_1"]="Thank you, Head Librarian.",
  ["3225202_1"]="Take your time, Head Librarian.",
  ["3226102_1"]="Wow, the view from up here is amazing... Wait, where's all that noise coming from?",
  ["3226301_1"]="Wait! Did something just hit Little Sky?!",
  ["3226301_2"]="Ugh, don't you dare mess with my Little Sky!",
  ["3227101_1"]="Let's drive these snakes away with the divine bird, young one.",
  ["3227102_1"]="Everyone, fall in line and keep the formation.",
  ["3227103_1"]="Clan patriarch, your tempo's a bit fast. Remember to coordinate everyone's pace.",
  ["3227104_1"]="Wow, this was totally worth it! I got tons of exclusive footage that isn't available online!",
  ["3228101_1"]="What do you think you are doing! Fireworks are banned in the city!",
  ["3229101_1"]="I think I'm lost... back to where I started.",
  ["3229102_1"]="Keep going... This is... your destiny...",
  ["3229103_1"]="Wait. I should see if there are any useful items I can gather here.",
  ["3229104_2"]="I should keep going forward. Sue... she's just ahead.",
  ["3229401_2"]="Whoa! The cat just showed up!",
  ["3229402_1"]="Hey! Be careful, girl!",
  ["3229403_1"]="Argh! My back!",
  ["3229404_1"]="Finally, we've caught this naughty cat... Huh? The branch—",
  ["3229405_1"]="Oh no, the branch Xin's standing on is breaking!",
  ["3229405_2"]="...!",
  ["3229406_1"]="Ouch, is this... a string?",
  ["3229407_1"]="Onlookers seeking help in catching the cat",
  ["3229601_1"]="These puppets have been awakened too.",
  ["3229701_1"]="Passing through the study",
  ["3229702_1"]="Maybe I should head upstairs. That bronze crane statue up there could be the key to activating the mechanism.",
  ["3229801_1"]="Someone help! These dummies have gone mad!",
  ["3229801_2"]="What? Why would puppets appear here?",
  ["3231201_1"]="Snakes? But why are there so many here?",
  ["3231201_2"]="I've dealt with them before, and now they dare to come to the gate.",
  ["3231202_1"]="It's strange. Snakes usually prefer dark spots and wouldn't settle among rocks.",
  ["3231202_2"]="This catwalk is a sunny spot. Not a good place for snakes to hang out.",
  ["3231301_1"]="Then I won't have to bother with a new cage!",
  ["3231302_1"]="Where did all these snakes come from?! Look out, Li Chi!",
  ["3231302_2"]="Are these snakes summoned by that huge one?",
  ["3231302_3"]="It seems like the giant snake is the mastermind behind all of this. Time to take them all out!",
  ["3231401_1"]="Huh? Why are there so many blades here?",
  ["3400102_1"]="With a swift slash, the monster blocking Ere's path falls to the ground with a thud.",
  ["3400102_10"]="(Take a step forward)",
  ["3400102_11"]="(Stop and wait)",
  ["3400102_12"]="My consciousness sharpened, and the familiar world faded away.",
  ["3400102_13"]="The fleeting pages of the book turned into a tidal wave, rushing toward me.",
  ["3400102_14"]="No, it's me rushing toward them. I can feel myself becoming a part of them.",
  ["3400102_15"]="Just one step further, and I'll enter a realm no human can endure...",
  ["3400102_16"]="My instincts scream for me to stop.",
  ["3400102_17"]="But my body freezes, unable to move, as I can only watch my consciousness merge with the pages.",
  ["3400102_18"]="Hey, you! Have you stared enough yet?",
  ["3400102_19"]="Just as my consciousness begins to fade, a familiar figure suddenly flashes at the end of the countless pages.",
  ["3400102_2"]="But the story before I does not end there. Like a boulder rolling downhill, events only accelerate.",
  ["3400102_20"]="Then, I feel a tug on my arm.",
  ["3400102_21"]="In the next instant, the scene I had just seen swiftly flashed before my eyes, like a mirage.",
  ["3400102_22"]="By the time the clock tower came into view, both the girl and the tower had already vanished without a trace. All that lingered in my mind were fragmented, indistinct memories.",
  ["3400102_23"]="In a haze, the sharp and playful voice echoed from behind once again.",
  ["3400102_24"]="I really can't tell if you're lacking common sense or just plain stupid... If I had been a second later, that book would've devoured you whole.",
  ["3400102_25"]="Seriously, the Tower of Babel's gone, and yet here you are, flipping through some girl's diary.",
  ["3400102_26"]="Didn't anyone ever teach you that it's very rude to touch other people's things without permission?",
  ["3400102_27"]="Or are you more interested in snooping around a girl's secrets than actually saving the world?",
  ["3400102_28"]="Seer.",
  ["3400102_3"]="I realize the once-fragile fragments in my hands have transformed into countless pages, swirling through the air.",
  ["3400102_4"]="Time begins to blur. It no longer flows linearly but branches outward in all directions.",
  ["3400102_5"]="I saw it. She grew under the moon's gentle care, only to bid farewell to that very moonlight in the face of confrontation.",
  ["3400102_6"]="I saw it. She once saw inheriting the role of Head Librarian as her mission, dutifully fulfilling her duties under everyone's expectations. But then, with the arrival of that girl—blank and empty as white paper—everything crumbled to dust.",
  ["3400102_7"]="I saw it. She left the tower to escape a certain fate, yet in the end, she found herself walking down that very same path once more.",
  ["3400102_8"]="Amidst the drifting pages, I saw \"fate\".",
  ["3400102_9"]="It felt as though taking just one more step would allow me to see through the mist that had always hung before me...",
  ["34010301_1"]="A peculiar glow emanates from the hall's center.",
  ["34010301_10"]="Try <color=#FEC66B>touching one of those celestial projections</color>. Don't worry, Dean Phaenomena won't harm us.",
  ["34010301_2"]="Are those… celestial bodies?",
  ["34010301_3"]="No, they're merely projections.",
  ["34010301_4"]="This probably has something to do with Phaenomena.",
  ["34010301_5"]="Phaenomena? The missing Dean?",
  ["34010301_6"]="Yes, that's her. Aratos—the Professor you knew—spoke to me about this before she passed.",
  ["34010301_7"]="These illusions are likely composed of gravitons, elementary particles whose existence hasn't been fully confirmed by modern physics yet. In the entire Astronomical Academy, Phaenomena is the only one who can materialize them.",
  ["34010301_8"]="This is… all new to me.",
  ["34010301_9"]="Heh, don't look so surprised. I'm the Grand Oracle, and it's only natural I hold knowledge unknown even to Society members.",
  ["34010302_1"]="A mere collision caused its collapse.",
  ["34010302_2"]="Seems like these projections are unstable… I wonder what Phaenomena went through...",
  ["34010303_1"]="The celestial projections moved. Let's follow them.",
  ["34010306_1"]="Weird, the gate's blocked by something invisible… a force field, perhaps? Is this Dean Phaenomena's doing, too?",
  ["34010306_2"]="Indeed. This impenetrable barrier shows her subconscious intent to stop anyone from going deeper into the academy.",
  ["34010306_3"]="So, how can we dispel it?",
  ["34010307_1"]="Remember those celestial projections we saw earlier?",
  ["34010307_2"]="Try guiding it to the <color=#FEC66B>target point</color> within the gravitational field here.",
  ["34010307_3"]="They might be the key to dispelling the barrier and finding Phaenomena.",
  ["34010308_1"]="The barrier's gone, we can move on now... Wait, the strings of Urania just vibrated slightly, but why?",
  ["34010308_2"]="Seems like guiding the projections onto those targets can disrupt Phaenomena's subconscious defenses.",
  ["34010310_1"]="The structures of the Astronomical Academy ascend towards the clouds. The majestic academy-city below shrinks, on the brink of dissolving into the endless blue expanse.",
  ["34010310_2"]="At this altitude, each breath carries the distinct chill of high altitudes.",
  ["34010310_3"]="What kind of force could possibly uproot an entire academy like this…?",
  ["34010310_4"]="...",
  ["34010310_5"]="If it's her, then something this massive is definitely possible.",
  ["34010310_6"]="Keep going up the stairs. Time's ticking.",
  ["34010401_1"]="Grand Oracle! More celestial projections ahead!",
  ["34010401_2"]="Hold on. Be careful of those spatial cracks around the projections.",
  ["34010401_3"]="These are definitely Phaenomena's doing… Let's get through them quickly.",
  ["34010402_1"]="Ugh, gravitational fields here are disrupted. Entering or crossing these cracks carelessly will hurt us—we must move fast.",
  ["34010402_2"]="Guide the projection to this gravitational target point. It might stabilize the disrupted field.",
  ["34010404_1"]="That stone platform… could it be…",
  ["34010404_10"]="A dead sun… I see, thanks.",
  ["34010404_11"]="...",
  ["34010404_12"]="I suspect this was left by Phaenomena, though she may have done it all unconsciously.",
  ["34010404_13"]="Let's put this white dwarf back where it belongs.",
  ["34010404_2"]="Yeah, this is where Professor Aratos's funeral was held. Look, these white flowers are Cretan tulips, her favorite.",
  ["34010404_3"]="Let's hope today's incidents won't disturb Professor Aratos's peace…",
  ["34010404_4"]="Look here, Grand Oracle. This projection is a bit different from previous ones. It's special somehow.",
  ["34010404_5"]="This… hmm, it has intricate textures. Maybe it's a white dwarf star, but I'm no astronomy expert—I can't confirm it.",
  ["34010404_6"]="Ariadne activates her communication terminal.",
  ["34010404_7"]="I need help from the Astronomical Academy. I'm sending a stellar image now—check it against the astronomical database.",
  ["34010404_8"]="Grand Oracle, this is an image of the Sun in five billion years—the \"corpse\" it'll leave behind.",
  ["34010404_9"]="When the Sun runs out of hydrogen and helium from fusion, this is how it'll end.",
  ["34010405_1"]="The celestial projection of the white dwarf flickers briefly before vanishing.",
  ["34010405_2"]="In its place appears a human figure.",
  ["34010405_3"]="What's going on here?!",
  ["34010405_4"]="Relax, this is likely a shard of Phaenomena's memory.",
  ["34010405_5"]="Memory? Shard? The way you talk about it, it sounds like memories have a physical form.",
  ["34010405_6"]="Human memories are intangible, stored in billions of neurons within the brain. This is for sure.",
  ["34010405_7"]="But Dean Phaenomena isn't composed of cells, so it's hardly surprising if her memories can condense into energy-based entities.",
  ["34010405_8"]="Let's move closer. It might show us her memories from the past.",
  ["34010406_1"]="Is the notebook that Dean Phaenomena's holding one of Professor Aratos's belongings? When I delivered documents to the Astronomical Academy, I saw Professor Aratos with a similar leather-bound book. She always had it with her...",
  ["34010406_10"]="A fragrant breeze brushes softly through Phaenomena's hair, lingering around her shoulders as if delicately combing through her strands.",
  ["34010406_11"]="She turns around abruptly, her vision engulfed by a myriads of fluttering white petals…",
  ["34010406_12"]="...And a hand extending toward her through the drifting blossoms.",
  ["34010406_13"]="Phaenomena's pupils contract sharply.",
  ["34010406_14"]="That was the end of the projection, Grand Oracle...",
  ["34010406_15"]="That's it, then. Phaenomena, you sure know how to leave us with puzzles.",
  ["34010406_16"]="Grand Oracle, the figure at the end...",
  ["34010406_17"]="I know. Phaenomena's disappearance must be related to that person. The situation now is probably tied to them as well.",
  ["34010406_18"]="Could it be Nemesis?",
  ["34010406_19"]="Most likely, but even if it's truly those rats pulling the strings, we don't have time to deal with them now.",
  ["34010406_2"]="Hmm, seems like this happened after I left the funeral...",
  ["34010406_20"]="If it's really Nemesis… then could Dean Phaenomena be in danger?",
  ["34010406_21"]="If Dean Phaenomena was attacked and imprisoned, and the entire Astronomical Academy lifted into the air—who could possibly do that?",
  ["34010406_22"]="We're short on information to draw any conclusions, but we must prepare for the worst.",
  ["34010406_23"]="Logos, I have a task for you. I'll explain the details soon. As for now, let's leave this area.",
  ["34010406_3"]="Phaenomena's image silently flips through a notebook, page by page. Although the notebook is filled with handwriting, the text appears inexplicably blurred.",
  ["34010406_4"]="I heard Dean Phaenomena and Professor Aratos were close friends. But why does she seem so... indifferent to Aratos's passing? Shouldn't she be mourning?",
  ["34010406_5"]="Shh, keep watching. Now isn't the time for questions.",
  ["34010406_6"]="With the conclusion of the funeral and the coffin's departure, mourners gradually dispersed, leaving only the blue-haired girl there.",
  ["34010406_7"]="She slowly turns pages of the notebook, her movements deliberate,  occasionally pausing at specific passages. Her countenance remains serene, devoid of sorrow.",
  ["34010406_8"]="Finally, she reaches the last page of the notebook but abruptly closes it, lifting her gaze toward the sky. Her previously calm expression shows a hint of surprise.",
  ["34010406_9"]="Behind her, the pure white Cretan tulips surrounding the coffin begin swaying gently.",
  ["34010407_1"]="The cracks moved.",
  ["34010407_2"]="Whether it's those celestial projections or disrupted gravitational fields, they're all manifestations of Dean Phaenomena's subconscious.",
  ["34010407_3"]="Perhaps Dean Phaenomena is trying to protect the academy from intruders in her own way.",
  ["34010407_4"]="So, if we eliminate what Dean Phaenomena sees as threats, those cracks will disappear, right?",
  ["34010407_5"]="Let's try it out.",
  ["34010501_1"]="A gray-white path stretches outward, symmetrically lined with neatly pruned laurels and flowers.",
  ["34010501_2"]="The garden lacks ornate decorations, yet it exudes a serene rationality emblematic of the Astronomical Academy.",
  ["34010501_3"]="A red-haired girl? The Grand Oracle's instructions are rather vague…",
  ["34010501_4"]="How am I supposed to find someone quickly in this vast academy…?",
  ["34010501_5"]="Guess I should climb higher. The view from up there should give me a better handle on the whole situation.",
  ["34010503_1"]="The gravitational field in the corridor is still distorted. Barging through would be a terrible idea. I should keep going upwards.",
  ["34010504_1"]="Again, the celestial projection is transforming into a human figure. It's Dean Phaenomena and…",
  ["34010504_2"]="Hmm? Who's this red-haired girl?",
  ["34010504_3"]="Let's go take a closer look. Perhaps this pavilion holds special significance for Dean Phaenomena...",
  ["34010505_1"]="Another celestial projection… Hmm, this one's unique. Judging from its texture… I think it's the Moon.",
  ["34010505_2"]="Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's Tycho Crater. Can't mistake that.",
  ["34010505_3"]="Why is it showing up in the pavilion? Could it be carrying Dean Phaenomena's memories as well?",
  ["34010505_4"]="Let's guide it toward the point within this gravitational field.",
  ["34010701_1"]="The celestial projection is gone, and the red-haired girl the Grand Oracle mentioned is nowhere to be found...",
  ["34010701_2"]="Speaking of red hair, Professor Aratos also had red hair.",
  ["34010701_3"]="Could that red-haired girl have some connection to Professor Aratos?",
  ["34010701_4"]="Well, standing here won't lead me anywhere. I should head back and investigate step by step.",
  ["34010702_1"]="The space around here seems distorted. What are these things?",
  ["34010702_2"]="Logos plucks a leaf and tosses it toward a spatial rift.",
  ["34010702_3"]="The leaf arcs through the air, entering one side of the rift, then promptly emerging from the other side.",
  ["34010702_4"]="I'm not exactly sure about the principle behind it, but based on past experience... this seems to be some kind of spatial distortion, like a miniature wormhole.",
  ["34010702_5"]="Perhaps due to the gravitational field disruptions, the space and time in certain parts of the academy have been affected, resulting in these <color=#FEC66B>miniature wormholes</color>.",
  ["34010702_6"]="I wonder if Dean Phaenomena is behind these spatial distortions too. What kind of being is she, really...?",
  ["34010702_7"]="Those wormholes are too tiny. It's way too risky for me to travel through them.",
  ["34010702_8"]="But what if I sent a celestial projection through instead?",
  ["34010703_1"]="This faintly glowing greenish projection seems to represent Uranus.",
  ["34010703_2"]="It looks like each memory piece left by Dean Phaenomena shows a projection of a celestial body in our solar system.",
  ["34010703_3"]="I'm starting to see a bit of a pattern here. While I'm far from solving the problem, finding a logical link is always reassuring.",
  ["34010703_4"]="Let's see what kind of memory this projection holds.",
  ["34010704_1"]="Compared to the previous ones, Professor Aratos in this projection looks a bit... older.",
  ["34010705_1"]="Thank you, Chairman, and thank you all, my esteemed colleagues.",
  ["34010705_10"]="It has fourteen times Earth's mass, with an orbital radius nineteen times Earth's.",
  ["34010705_2"]="I'm presenting my latest paper—\"On Gravity's Decisive Influence on Celestial Movement and Planetary Orbits.\"",
  ["34010705_3"]="...",
  ["34010705_4"]="Please allow me to remind you, Scholar Aratos. The scale of gravity's effects has yet to be clearly defined.",
  ["34010705_5"]="Your statement is inaccurate. I've proposed a formula...",
  ["34010705_6"]="Scholar Aratos, the cornerstone of science is falsifiability. Non-falsifiable theories should be relegated to theological discussions.",
  ["34010705_7"]="...",
  ["34010705_8"]="What are you up to, Phaenomena? Go back, now!",
  ["34010705_9"]="There's a planet. You haven't discovered it yet.",
  ["34010706_1"]="It has fourteen times Earth's mass, with an orbital radius nineteen times Earth's...",
  ["34010706_2"]="Could that undiscovered planet be Uranus? So, Uranus was not yet discovered back then?",
  ["34010706_3"]="Hmm, the cracks are still here. Seems like the gravitational field here isn't stable yet.",
  ["34010706_4"]="Another celestial projection has appeared. Wait, this dark blue celestial body... and this distinctive \"Great Dark Spot\"... It's Neptune.",
  ["34010706_5"]="What memories might Neptune's projection reveal?",
  ["34010707_1"]="The observation results are in, and they exactly match what you said.",
  ["34010707_2"]="...At the edge of the solar system, another giant planet exists.",
  ["34010707_3"]="It has seventeen times Earth's mass, with an orbital radius thirty times Earth's.",
  ["34010707_4"]="Exactly as you predicted, down to the smallest detail.",
  ["34010707_5"]="How exactly did you know this? Come on, tell me!",
  ["34010707_6"]="It's simply the truth.",
  ["34010901_1"]="Several celestial projections have appeared. Looks like I need to guide them all to their respective points to fix the gravitational field.",
  ["34010901_2"]="Let's keep calm and deal with them one by one.",
  ["34010902_1"]="Good, the force field is gone. Let's proceed this way.",
  ["34010903_1"]="Several cracks have appeared here as well.",
  ["34010903_2"]="It seems the gravitational field becomes more chaotic as I get closer to the lecture halls. Perhaps I'm getting near my target...",
  ["34010903_3"]="Well, no point thinking about it now. Let's handle the immediate trouble first.",
  ["34010904_1"]="What...? So many celestial projections here!",
  ["34010904_2"]="Are these memories all from Dean Phaenomena? That must be a long story.",
  ["34010904_3"]="Let's see... Earth, Sun, Moon... Hmm? What's going on? Why is the Sun orbiting around the Earth?",
  ["34010904_4"]="Even a Philosophy Academy student would spot that mistake. Looks like I have to correct these orbits myself.",
  ["34010905_1"]="Model...",
  ["34010905_2"]="Phaenomena? Who told you to arrange it this way?",
  ["34010905_3"]="...No one.",
  ["34010905_4"]="...",
  ["34010905_5"]="That's strange. Are they studying... the Sun-Earth motion?",
  ["34011201_1"]="These white flowers... We're back where I first arrived.",
  ["34011201_10"]="...",
  ["34011201_11"]="(I don't know. In fact, no Aratos across generations could possibly answer your question. We simply follow the procedure—each time an Aratos dies, the next takes on the name.)",
  ["34011201_12"]="(Phaenomena, being a star, is sometimes like a stone. She needs decades, centuries, or even millennia for the environment to shape her.)",
  ["34011201_13"]="(A human life is but a blink compared to a star that's existed for billions of years. The fact that she even remembers the name \"Aratos\" is already a miracle.)",
  ["34011201_14"]="So, that's why you pass down the name… to reinforce her connection with you as her companions and comforters?",
  ["34011201_15"]="(Maybe. In the end, we don't even know whether Phaenomena sees us as distinct individuals or a mere recurring symbol.)",
  ["34011201_16"]="…Doesn't that make you feel sad?",
  ["34011201_17"]="Aratos lowered her hands. After a long pause, she wove her answer.",
  ["34011201_18"]="(Aratos does feel sad… but there's nothing we can do about it.)",
  ["34011201_19"]="(Let's move on. Phaenomena is still waiting for us.)",
  ["34011201_2"]="(This is where I was attacked on my way here.)",
  ["34011201_3"]="The attacker might still be lurking nearby. We'll have to be extra careful from here on.",
  ["34011201_4"]="The white dwarf is still there... It was through this celestial projection that the Grand Oracle and I saw the memories from Aratos's funeral.",
  ["34011201_5"]="Who did Dean Phaenomena see at the end...? And what did that person do to her? Could that person have also attacked her, just like they did to you?",
  ["34011201_6"]="(No, I don't think anyone could physically harm Phaenomena.)",
  ["34011201_7"]="(But I honestly don't know what she went through. There's nothing like this recorded by any Aratos before me.)",
  ["34011201_8"]="The white dwarf, the remains of a dead star, the funeral... and Aratos... When I saw those projections, one question kept haunting me.",
  ["34011201_9"]="Why did Dean Phaenomena seem so indifferent to the death of the previous Professor Aratos?",
  ["34011302_2"]="The path to the observatory is blocked by a force field. Looks like the gravitational field here is unstable as well.",
  ["34011302_4"]="Just like before, let's guide the celestial projection to the point.",
  ["34011303_1"]="...Delphi Gravitational Wave Observatory, now officially operational.",
  ["34011303_10"]="(At that time, Phaenomena wasn't showing any signs of unusual behavior...)",
  ["34011303_11"]="These memories aren't complete. Maybe there's something hidden within them, but we haven't noticed that.",
  ["34011303_12"]="Let's find the other celestial projections and piece together what happened in this place.",
  ["34011303_2"]="...",
  ["34011303_3"]="...It's a voice I heard a long time ago.",
  ["34011303_4"]="Are you... talking about gravitational waves? Are you saying gravitational waves sound beautiful?",
  ["34011303_5"]="...",
  ["34011303_6"]="All right, let's have Dean Phaenomena step down now. She has other things on her schedule, and I'll be answering your questions from here.",
  ["34011303_7"]="...",
  ["34011303_8"]="This... looks like the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the Astronomical Academy's Gravitational Wave Observatory, right? I was invited too, but I was studying abroad in Qian at the time...",
  ["34011303_9"]="(That's right. The host was my mentor, the previous Aratos.)",
  ["34011304_1"]="(Is this celestial body... Jupiter?)",
  ["34011304_2"]="Be careful. The gravitational field here is unstable. Guide it to the point carefully.",
  ["34011305_1"]="You see... I've aged. I can no longer keep up with you along the shore.",
  ["34011305_10"]="(To her, each new Aratos is perhaps just a creation born from the redistribution of energy and information.)",
  ["34011305_11"]="Are you… feeling sad?",
  ["34011305_12"]="Aratos responds with a gentle nod.",
  ["34011305_2"]="Sometimes I envy you. You're like a star, unchanging, harboring no fear of death.",
  ["34011305_3"]="There's no need to fear death.",
  ["34011305_4"]="\"On this planet, matter and energy circulate endlessly. Life grows, reproduces, passes its flesh through the food chain, becomes bone and remains, then decomposes and returns to the earth. But the atoms remain. They are still part of this planet. They never truly end.\"",
  ["34011305_5"]="...",
  ["34011305_6"]="Phaenomena... seems unable to understand death in the human sense.",
  ["34011305_7"]="(Yeah. To her, as a star, death is like a supernova. Matter scatters across the universe but never truly vanishes.)",
  ["34011305_8"]="(Her perception of death is different from ours.)",
  ["34011305_9"]="(That's why she has never shed a tear at the funeral of any Aratos.)",
  ["34011306_1"]="Are you okay? We could take a short break if you need. Though, honestly speaking, it might be best if we don't…",
  ["34011306_2"]="Who knows how long the Grand Oracle can wait for us? The Labyrinth of Reverie could descend at any moment. I doubt that would be any better than the Astronomical Academy floating off into space…",
  ["34011306_3"]="(You really have a unique way of speaking. Thank you for your concern, but it's not necessary… Phaenomena is still waiting for me. I must return to her side right away.)",
  ["35010302_1"]="It's Nemesis. Looks like Hoplite's suspicion is true—they're clearly behind this.",
  ["35010303_1"]="Who's in charge of the Academy's labs? Why are those Mimetic Elements in the petri dishes getting loose?",
  ["35010303_2"]="Once this is done, I'll be demanding a written apology from the students responsible.",
  ["35010304_1"]="Oh, no. We've startled some Mimetic Elements!",
  ["35010305_1"]="The celestial projection… exploded?",
  ["35010306_1"]="Collisions trigger explosions. Maybe we can use their instability to fix our problems.",
  ["35010306_2"]="Dean Ariadne, I feel obliged to remind you: your actions might count as damaging academy property.",
  ["35010306_3"]="Well, then please keep this under wraps, my trusted Head Student.",
  ["35010307_1"]="All problems solved. Let's head into the main building through this way.",
  ["35010402_1"]="The cracks are gone, Grand Oracle. Let's guide the celestial projection to the target point within this gravitational field!",
  ["35010403_1"]="The cracks are back... Gravitational fields here are disrupted once more. Let's deal with the threats first.",
  ["35010404_1"]="Let's keep moving. The Astronomical Academy's garden is just ahead.",
  ["35010405_1"]="The projections are too unstable. They'll detonate if they touch the disrupted area.",
  ["35010501_1"]="Another celestial projection. I can use its instability to drive away the Mimetic Elements.",
  ["35010701_1"]="The barrier is gone. This path is finally clear.",
  ["35010702_1"]="More wormholes. The situation here doesn't look promising, either.",
  ["35010702_2"]="I'll try using these wormholes to fix the gravitational field in this area.",
  ["35010703_1"]="As I expected, it's never that simple.",
  ["35010704_1"]="If I remember correctly, this way leads to the main lecture hall of the Astronomical Academy. Let's go take a look.",
  ["35010705_1"]="The target point is just on the other side of the wormhole. Maybe guiding the celestial projection through is worth a shot.",
  ["35010901_1"]="The gravitational field... seems to have changed a bit, but the cracks haven't completely disappeared yet.",
  ["35010902_1"]="Those Mimetic Elements trapped by gravity are loose now... Well, let's deal with them swiftly.",
  ["35010903_1"]="Footprints leading to the lecture theater... Someone's been here.",
  ["35010904_1"]="Good. Now, let's guide the next projection into its proper place.",
  ["35010905_1"]="Wait, that's not right. According to modern astronomy, the Sun, as a star, should be at the <color=#FEC66B>geometric center</color> of the system.",
  ["35010906_1"]="As expected, there's a memory shard of Dean Phaenomena here too.",
  ["35011201_1"]="(Let's take the stairs over there to reach the Gravitational Wave Observation Chamber on the upper level. From there, we'll head to the observatory.)",
  ["35011202_1"]="(Up ahead is the Gravitational Wave Observation Chamber. It was also the office of the previous Aratos.)",
  ["35011202_2"]="(We're very close to the observatory now.)",
  ["35011601_1"]="I'll do my best to create a moment where she can hear your voices.",
  ["35011601_2"]="But what exactly should we do, Grand Oracle?",
  ["35011601_3"]="First, let's cool her down a bit physically. I could use a little warm-up myself.",
  ["4000101_1"]="We haven't received any visit requests from our allies lately. If it's some lost traveler, just erase their memory and send them back to the nearest town.",
  ["4000101_10"]="(Give her my real name.)",
  ["4000101_11"]="(Remain silent.)",
  ["4000101_12"]="[BBNAME], right? Where did you get this?",
  ["4000101_13"]="It's alright if you don't want to talk about yourself. But where did you get this?",
  ["4000101_14"]="(Tell Nanna about my conversation with Cosmos.)",
  ["4000101_15"]="Cosmos gave you the Library of Babel, you say?",
  ["4000101_16"]="At that moment, the black monolith shifts—ever so slightly, almost imperceptibly.",
  ["4000101_17"]="As if the eye lurking in the abyss had just blinked.",
  ["4000101_18"]="I glance around, but no one else seems to notice.",
  ["4000101_19"]="Only I seem to feel that something is shifting in the air.",
  ["4000101_2"]="Those clothes... don't belong to the people of Obed. How did someone like that end up here by accident?",
  ["4000101_20"]="...",
  ["4000101_21"]="An indescribable tension brews in the suffocating silence.",
  ["4000101_22"]="Do you know what it means to hold this pendant?",
  ["4000101_23"]="I will take charge of this place.",
  ["4000101_24"]="I don't know.",
  ["4000101_25"]="Before Cosmos left, he mentioned that the one who holds this pendant is the prophesied \"Seer.\"",
  ["4000101_26"]="And that we must support that person unconditionally.",
  ["4000101_27"]="(The prophesied Seer?)",
  ["4000101_28"]="Let's put aside whether that prophecy is true or not.",
  ["4000101_29"]="This person seems completely unaware of our world.",
  ["4000101_3"]="Nanna.",
  ["4000101_4"]="This person is holding the director's keepsake.",
  ["4000101_5"]="Her calm statement plunges the space into pin-drop silence.",
  ["4000101_6"]="...",
  ["4000101_7"]="The woman who had just been warm and gentle now fixes me with a piercing gaze.",
  ["4000101_8"]="Nanna steps forward, her tone easing slightly as her footsteps echo in the silence.",
  ["4000101_9"]="I'm Nanna. What's your name?",
  ["4000102_1"]="<color=#fec66b>The Beacon</color> is awakening. It's been dormant for so many years, why is it...?",
  ["4000102_2"]="<color=#fec66b>The Library of Babel</color> is opening.",
  ["4000104_1"]="Their argument goes on, but their voices gradually fade into the distance.",
  ["4000104_2"]="All the while, the monolith grows taller, more solemn with each passing moment.",
  ["4000104_3"]="No... this isn't just my imagination...",
  ["4000104_4"]="It truly is... watching me, calling out to me.",
  ["4000104_5"]="Without realizing it, I take a step toward it.",
  ["4000105_1"]="She murmurs as she walks towards me, her tone familiar, as if we were old friends who haven't seen each other in years.",
  ["4000105_2"]="Oh? How strange. You, in this era, have already gained the <color=#fec66b>permissions</color>.",
  ["4000105_3"]="Who granted you the permissions? And when did that happen?",
  ["4000105_4"]="Who are you?",
  ["4000105_5"]="Have we met before?",
  ["4000105_6"]="I'd love to introduce myself, but I'll let the <color=#fec66b>version of me who met you for the first time</color> do it.",
  ["4000105_7"]="I know you, but you don't know me, at least not <color=#fec66b>now</color>.",
  ["4000105_8"]="As much as I'd like to catch up, the current situation doesn't allow it.",
  ["4000107_1"]="Slowly, a golden sphere rises from the distant ruins. It has no sharp edges, yet the moment it comes into view, a prickling sensation fills the atmosphere.",
  ["4000107_10"]="Find <color=#fec66b>Tasny</color>, and he'll help you discover that command.",
  ["4000107_11"]="Go find that command and reshape the doomed future.",
  ["4000107_12"]="That's why you've come to this place—you're the only one who can save everyone.",
  ["4000107_13"]="What on earth is this...?",
  ["4000107_14"]="I understand that you're confused.",
  ["4000107_15"]="You don't need to understand my words. Just remember them.",
  ["4000107_16"]="Then, relay my exact words to my past self who knows nothing about any of this.",
  ["4000107_17"]="The sphere continues to rise, with any debris or wreckage it touches silently dissolving into its radiance.",
  ["4000107_18"]="The light at its core has reached its peak, poised to erupt at any moment.",
  ["4000107_2"]="No one knows what force drives its smooth movement. The sphere floats in the air, like the sun hanging high in the sky, surrounded by a golden ring resembling the corona of a star.",
  ["4000107_3"]="Directly in front of the sphere is a massive void, initially dark but now gathering light within.",
  ["4000107_4"]="See that sphere? That's the menace destroying this realm.",
  ["4000107_5"]="Soon it will obliterate this place completely.",
  ["4000107_6"]="As if to confirm her words, the golden ring around the sphere ignites, resembling the erupting corona of a real star.",
  ["4000107_7"]="A wave of intense heat rushes toward me.",
  ["4000107_8"]="Yet the girl remains oblivious to the imminent danger, her tone still calm.",
  ["4000107_9"]="But we still have a chance. This sphere is actually a machine that can be harnessed, and there is a <color=#fec66b>command</color> to stop it.",
  ["4010601_1"]="Fifty-nine millimeters.",
  ["4010601_10"]="Nanna glances around.",
  ["4010601_11"]="Where's Enki?",
  ["4010601_12"]="About 10 minutes and 36 seconds ago, he went to Known Sector B19 on Modern Floor.",
  ["4010601_13"]="I've said it so many times, when the \"Library\" is opened, stay in your current original sector... Why can't he just listen?",
  ["4010601_14"]="At that moment, Nanna seems to recall something.",
  ["4010601_15"]="Hold on, Sector B19? Isn't that the starting sector where the <color=#fec66b>Squad of No Return</color> was before they departed?",
  ["4010601_16"]="Yeah.",
  ["4010601_17"]="...",
  ["4010601_18"]="What a troublemaker! This Tasny's child is just a carbon copy of him.",
  ["4010601_19"]="...",
  ["4010601_2"]="Ninety-eight millimeters.",
  ["4010601_20"]="Judging by his speed and usual antics, he should be in Sector A87 on the same floor.",
  ["4010601_21"]="You're fast, Nanna. If you go after him, there's still time.",
  ["4010601_22"]="Alright, I get it.",
  ["4010601_23"]="As Nanna prepares to leave, the girl calls out to her again.",
  ["4010601_24"]="Nanna.",
  ["4010601_25"]="Huh?",
  ["4010601_26"]="Can you bring me some pottery clay when you come back?",
  ["4010601_27"]="And my chisel is broken. I need a new one.",
  ["4010601_28"]="Is that all you need?",
  ["4010601_29"]="Yeah, that's it.",
  ["4010601_3"]="Sixty millimeters.",
  ["4010601_4"]="She skillfully switches the tools in her hand, each cut precise and without deviation, as if made by a machine.",
  ["4010601_5"]="Bit by bit, the sculpture's head begins taking shape under her skilled hands.",
  ["4010601_6"]="Ninsar stops only when the clay next to her hand is used up.",
  ["4010601_7"]="Oh, it's all gone.",
  ["4010601_8"]="As soon as her words are spoken, quick footsteps approach from afar.",
  ["4010601_9"]="Ninsar... Great, you're here.",
  ["4010602_1"]="The clock \"restored\" by Ninsar.",
  ["4010602_2"]="She managed to bring the clock back to a specific moment in time when its hands had not yet begun to turn. An unfamiliar cat is sleeping on top of it.",
  ["4010602_3"]="(A cat?)",
  ["4010603_1"]="The nameless statue quietly receives the finishing touches from its creator.",
  ["4010603_2"]="This is the first time Ninsar has actively wanted to create something new.",
  ["4010603_3"]="No one knows what name Ninsar will give it once the statue is complete.",
  ["4010604_1"]="The once-clear path is now blocked by an unfamiliar gate.",
  ["4010604_2"]="This is the Foolproof Door. Only those who answer Master Enki's carefully selected questions correctly may pass through.",
  ["4010604_3"]="...",
  ["4010605_1"]="Fifteen minutes have passed. Good, the biggest obstacle to my plan hasn't shown up yet.",
  ["4010605_10"]="Enki's eyes widen in disbelief with a hint of dissatisfaction.",
  ["4010605_11"]="I protest! Only the most despicable of brutes would resort to such a crude method to bypass the Foolproof Door!",
  ["4010605_12"]="You're cheating! Cheating! How could you?!",
  ["4010605_13"]="Enki yells and scans the surroundings, seeking an opportunity to escape.",
  ["4010605_14"]="But before Enki can make a run for it, Nanna grabs the back of his collar and lifts him up like a kitten.",
  ["4010605_15"]="A stinky brat who doesn't follow the rules has no right to protest.",
  ["4010605_16"]="How many times have I made it clear? You and Ninsar aren't allowed to venture onto the Path of No Return until you're grown ups.",
  ["4010605_17"]="If you continue to be so disobedient, I will kick you out of the tower for the rest of your life.",
  ["4010605_18"]="Enki tries to say something, but Nanna's stern gaze silences him. When he realizes Nanna may kick him out of the tower forever, his face goes white.",
  ["4010605_19"]="Please, Nanna, don't. I'm sorry, my good Nanna... Enheduanna... please don't banish me...",
  ["4010605_2"]="Once I cross the next sector, I can blend in with the \"Squad of No Return,\" and this time, I will...",
  ["4010605_20"]="Stop calling my full name with that pitiful tone when you want something from me.",
  ["4010605_21"]="Enki tries to explain, but Nanna notices humanoid creatures approaching from the Unknown Sector. She decides to postpone her lecture for now.",
  ["4010605_22"]="...",
  ["4010605_3"]="The figure looming in front of Enki ends his grand plan.",
  ["4010605_4"]="You will what?",
  ["4010605_5"]="Whoa! Nanna! How did you get here?!",
  ["4010605_6"]="No way! How did you pass the Foolproof Door?",
  ["4010605_7"]="I prepared so many questions. Did you really answer them all correctly?",
  ["4010605_8"]="Could it be you know how many grains of sand are on Earth's surface? Or calculate how many drops of water it would take to extinguish the sun? Or how long it would take a chocolate bar that doubles in mass every minute to fill the entire universe?!",
  ["4010605_9"]="Of course not. I didn't answer those ridiculous questions. I just smashed the gate. By the way, you're not allowed to install any gates without permission.",
  ["4010606_1"]="When all the commotion settles down, the light from the black monolith dims once again.",
  ["4010606_10"]="...",
  ["4010606_11"]="Whatever.",
  ["4010606_12"]="...",
  ["4010606_2"]="Enki storms angrily into Ninsar's room as the infinite space disappears.",
  ["4010606_3"]="You idiot! Idiot! Yeah! I mean it! You're such an IDIOT!",
  ["4010606_4"]="Why did you tell Nanna where I was?! Why did you stop me?! Didn't you promise not to tell her my whereabouts?!",
  ["4010606_5"]="Ninsar continues her work without even looking up.",
  ["4010606_6"]="That was just your one-sided request. I don't remember agreeing to it.",
  ["4010606_7"]="I don't care! You're mean! And stupid!",
  ["4010606_8"]="Ninsar is a dummy! I'll never play with you again! And I'll never talk to you anymore! People who don't keep their promises are the worst!",
  ["4010606_9"]="The chisel in Ninsar's hand pauses for a moment.",
  ["4040101_1"]="Saw you from afar and wondered if it was you. Are you here for an inspection today?",
  ["4040101_2"]="Yeah, what are you doing here?",
  ["4040101_3"]="Just fishing but haven't caught anything all morning. It's weird. The fish aren't biting lately.",
  ["4040101_4"]="By the way, there are so many ospreys here. So naturally, there should be a lot of fish around.",
  ["4040101_5"]="Yeah, maybe they're the ones scaring away my fish.",
  ["4040101_6"]="And there are so many insects, too. But you know what? Those mosquitoes don't even seem to bite people anymore. Been sitting here all morning, and not a single mosquito bite on my leg.",
  ["4040101_7"]="Ah, sorry for rambling. Don't forget about the calligraphy assembly at the square tonight! My old man is looking forward to meeting you there.",
  ["4040101_8"]="I'll see if I have time for that.",
  ["4040102_1"]="I should head to the riverbank and take a closer look.",
  ["4040103_1"]="Qing calmly unsheathes her blade after swatting down the last insect in the air, but her eyebrows remain furrowed because of the weird sensation from her fingertips.",
  ["4040103_2"]="Feels like my blade just hit an iron block.",
  ["4040103_3"]="The remains of an insect stick to the base of the street lamp from her swipe just now. Seeing the deep gouge on the lamp, Qing lets out a deep sigh.",
  ["4040103_4"]="Used too much force. I can't control my strength when my mind is in turmoil...",
  ["4040103_5"]="What Qing has struck is not just a streetlight, but a part of CangLin City's integrated infrastructure—the greening and irrigation system that runs parallel to the lighting system.",
  ["4040103_6"]="Similar to other infrastructure facilities in CangLin City, this system operates under the centralized agricultural production system, providing <color=#fec66b>sprinkler irrigation to the surrounding vegetation at regular intervals</color>.",
  ["4040103_7"]="Once the greenery is seeded, the system automatically takes care of the vegetation throughout its growth cycle, eliminating the need for human labor.",
  ["4040103_8"]="Each unit costs a fortune, and if it really got damaged, Qing would have to pay a month's salary to cover its repairs.",
  ["4040103_9"]="But seriously, why are there so many insects here? And what's with those clustered birds? Let's go over and take a look.",
  ["4040104_1"]="What's happening to these ospreys?",
  ["4040104_2"]="Their feathers are blue, and their claws and beak are sharp and hard. Are they infected with some kind of contagious disease?",
  ["4040105_1"]="Lately, the ospreys near the river haven't been in a good mood.",
  ["4040105_2"]="In the past, only a few hungry ospreys would come close to humans and beg for food or snatch food from tourists.",
  ["4040105_3"]="But recently, they've been swarming into the city, and it doesn't seem to be for food. Even when humans try to feed them, they don't show much interest.",
  ["4040105_4"]="If it's not about food, then what are they after? Hmm... Maybe some wild instincts kicking in or something?",
  ["4040105_5"]="Hah, I'm no bird expert! Just throwing ideas out there!",
  ["4040301_1"]="It lines up with our earlier assessment. This change is caused by anomalies.",
  ["4040301_2"]="I lost my temper. After all, the staff at the CangLin municipal government didn't have the means to solve the problem themselves. They haven't figured out what's really happening...",
  ["4040301_3"]="*Sigh* Anger can cloud judgment. Looks like I still need to work on myself. After sorting this out, I'll practice calligraphy and reflect on myself...",
  ["4040301_4"]="I've got to get back and... Huh? Why are there so many people gathered at the government?",
  ["4040302_1"]="You're saying there are issues with the irrigation area in region I3-6, too? That's on the north side, right?",
  ["4040302_2"]="Yeah, we grow rice there. According to the growth cycle, it should be sprouting ears by now, but this year it seems to be growing unusually slow. Are crops in your area affected, too?",
  ["4040302_3"]="Yeah, same here. I oversee the irrigation area in region C2-9, and we're facing the same problems. That's why I wanted to check if there have been any climate changes this year.",
  ["4040303_1"]="Lately, the animals at the Third Breeding Center have been losing their appetites. Is something wrong with the breeding environment?",
  ["4040303_2"]="Which animals are affected the most? Pigs, cows, or sheep?",
  ["4040303_3"]="All of them. That's why we suspect something might be wrong at the farm itself.",
  ["4040303_4"]="We're experiencing similar issues at the Seventh Breeding Center. We specialize in poultry, and lately, the hens won't lay eggs. They better do a thorough examination.",
  ["4040304_1"]="Didn't expect so many people to be here today. Oh? Isn't that Secretary Qing?",
  ["4040304_2"]="What can I do for you?",
  ["4040304_3"]="Oh, nothing much. Just wanted to ask if this year's Harvest Festival is still happening.",
  ["4040304_4"]="The Bureau of Culture & Tourism hasn't started their usual promotions like they normally do by this time. Wondering if there are any changes...",
  ["4040304_5"]="I'm planning to grab some stuff for the festival and make a profit. Just hope nothing major messes up my plan, you know?",
  ["4040306_1"]="Failing to strike its target, the predatory bird spreads its wings and disappears into the clouds.",
  ["4040306_2"]="Whew... Thanks a bunch! Thought I'd lose my scalp or, worse, my expensive lens. If anything happened to either, it would be a real pain in the wallet.",
  ["4040306_3"]="It's hard to capture photos of such predatory birds in the city, so I got a bit too close.",
  ["4040306_4"]="Is what just happened a common occurrence?",
  ["4040306_5"]="Of course not. Ospreys in these parts are a rare sight, and they usually take off when people get too close.",
  ["4040306_6"]="They rarely leave the wetlands because the city doesn't offer much prey for them.",
  ["4040306_7"]="Plus, most of the ospreys around CangLin City are used to humans. And seriously, we're way bigger than them, so I don't get why they'd attack me.",
  ["4040308_1"]="These ospreys always gather around the sprinklers.",
  ["4040308_2"]="I wonder if the sprinklers make certain noises that attracts birds?",
  ["4040309_1"]="These animals keep getting close to the sprinklers. Perhaps I should manually shut them down.",
  ["4040501_1"]="Hmm, let's start investigating the nearest module, in that two o'clock direction.",
  ["4040502_1"]="In the center of the field stands the most advanced agricultural sprinkler system in CangLin City.",
  ["4040502_2"]="Rows upon rows of sprinklers pour water and fertilizers into the soil, while swarms of drones buzz around, monitoring pests and crop diseases. Sensors scattered throughout the fields provide real-time data to CangLin City.",
  ["4040502_3"]="The centralized agricultural production system handles all the complicated decision-making. It knows the growth status of every single crop in the area—when they will sprout, when they will ripen, and when they will wither.",
  ["4040502_4"]="The land is divided up with waterways and sprinklers, ensuring each leaf gets its fair share of sunlight and nutrients.",
  ["4040502_5"]="Similar to other infrastructure facilities in CangLin City, these devices operate under the centralized agricultural production system, providing sprinkler irrigation to the surrounding vegetation at regular intervals.",
  ["4040502_6"]="Currently, the sprinklers in this field are <color=#fec66b>turned off</color>, and the land is <color=#fec66b>dry</color>, perhaps because the irrigation cycle has not started yet.",
  ["4040502_7"]="Hmm, nothing seems out of the ordinary here. Let's look elsewhere.",
  ["4040503_1"]="The land here is <color=#fec66b>wet</color>, and there are droplets of water on the green leaves. It is clear that this farmland has just been irrigated.",
  ["4040503_2"]="The sharp leaves of the barnyard grasses leave numerous scratches on careless Xin's calves.",
  ["4040503_3"]="Xin bends down, touching the stems of the plants, when she realizes they are unusually hard for plants.",
  ["4040503_4"]="Ouch, that hurts. Even if we ignore the abnormal behavior of the livestock, what's wrong with these plants?",
  ["4040503_5"]="Let's head to the hydroponic area.",
  ["4040505_1"]="This is not a pastoral area, but many farm animals have gathered here. They show unusual interest in drinking water. This is strange...",
  ["4040505_2"]="Looks like I need to do some serious investigating here.",
  ["4040506_1"]="A large number of hoofprints and scratches are scattered across the ground along the shore. Looking at these markings, Xin falls deep in thought.",
  ["4040506_2"]="Since when did these farm animals develop such tough hooves?",
  ["4040507_1"]="Where are the people in charge of this area? Perhaps it'd be quicker to just ask them.",
  ["4040508_1"]="The water has an eerie greenish color to it, akin to the aftermath of a cyanobacteria outbreak. However, there is no algae on the surface. Nor is there a fishy smell.",
  ["4040508_2"]="Xin bends down and dips her fingertips into the water and sticks out the tip of her tongue.",
  ["4040508_3"]="Hmm, better not. Qing warned me about not tasting unknown stuff.",
  ["4040509_1"]="The hair, skin, muscles, and blood of the farm animals here all have a slight greenish tinge to them.",
  ["4040509_2"]="Yeah, just like the color of this water.",
  ["4040509_3"]="Well, I can't figure out what's going on here, so let's not dwell on it. I'll make a record of everything and report it to Qing later.",
  ["4040509_4"]="If Qing finds out I've knocked out so many farm animals along the way, she'll probably give me a terrible lecture. Anyway, I should report to the person in charge here.",
  ["4040509_5"]="Hmm, it's not my fault, right? Those animals attacked me first, so I had to defend myself.",
  ["4040510_1"]="Hey, is that a residence? Finally! The person in charge of this place must be there. I should go check with them.",
  ["4040510_2"]="But before that, looks like I'll have to help the owner teach these unruly animals a lesson.",
  ["4040511_1"]="The device is deactivated, but the faint sound of water circulating echoes. It seems that it is about to be turned on.",
  ["4040801_1"]="The fog is so dense that the road can barely be seen ahead.",
  ["4040801_2"]="Relying on her combat instincts, Zero eliminates the last of the greenish monsters that attempted to attack her. As the dust settles, Zero wanders around in confusion, covering her head.",
  ["4040801_3"]="Seer...",
  ["4040801_4"]="The moment she realized that she is completely separated from [BBNAME], her pupils contract sharply.",
  ["4040801_5"]="No... where... where is Seer...?",
  ["4040801_6"]="Calm down, Zero!",
  ["4040801_7"]="Anchirp, having returned, lands on Zero's head and pecks at her.",
  ["4040801_8"]="Don't worry. That guy isn't that incompetent. Let me look around for you.",
  ["4040802_1"]="Look what I've found!",
  ["4040802_2"]="Chirp! There's a lit-up house not far ahead! Let's head that way, and even if that guy isn't there, we can ask the locals for help!",
  ["4040802_3"]="Come on, let's hurry. I'll lead the way.",

  ["4040803_3"]="Ch-chirp?! Wait, what?!",
  ["4040803_4"]="What are you doing, silly girl?! Why are you breaking this stuff? What if its owner doesn't want to help us now?!",
  ["4040803_5"]="Don't break anything unless you have to! We're in a civilized society here. If you do something bad, you'll end up getting arrested!",
  ["4040803_6"]="...",
  ["4040803_7"]="Alright, alright. Calm down. The \"password\" the machine mentioned might be the name of the owner here.",
  ["4040803_8"]="This place should be the owner's manor... or something like that? Anyway, let's look around, and maybe we can find something!",
  ["4040804_1"]="The board next to the road post states the following:",

  ["4040808_1"]="Chirp! Look what I've found! Footprints! From that annoying guy!",
  ["4040808_2"]="Zero stares at the trail of footprints, her voice still cold and harsh.",
  ["4040808_3"]="Why are there two trails?",
  ["4040808_4"]="Chirp, one of them is definitely from that guy! I can't be mistaken! But the other one...",
  ["4040808_5"]="I don't get it. I'm just a little bird with a brain the size of a walnut. This is too complicated for me...",
  ["4040808_6"]="Is Seer being held hostage?",
  ["4040808_7"]="The murderous aura surrounding Zero becomes palpable. Anchirp flinches and quickly hides under Zero's cloak.",
  ["4040808_8"]="Chirp, I'm feeling sleepy... The dawn is almost there, and even this diligent bird needs to catch some Zs...",
  ["4040809_1"]="Clusters of dark green crystals, formed from some unknown substance and solidified into peculiar geometric shapes.",
  ["4040809_2"]="Unlike aged patina, these clusters emit a vivid radiance, as if they will never decay.",
  ["4040809_3"]="Unlike steel or silver, these clusters possess colors reminiscent of living organisms rather than crystalline formations.",
  ["4040809_4"]="In short, these otherworldly clusters are unlike any known metal.",
  ["4040809_5"]="I've never seen anything like this in any book.",
  ["4040809_6"]="Chirp! It's bright and shiny! Is it a gem? It must be! Can I take a piece?",
  ["4040809_7"]="Anchirp's eyes light up as it attempts to perch on one of the crystal clusters.",
  ["4040809_8"]="But as soon as its claw touches one of the crystals, it recoils as if shocked.",
  ["4040809_9"]="Eeew... That's gross! My claws are all dirty now. These things are definitely not gems!",
  ["4040810_1"]="The insect eggs attached to the roots emit a fluorescent green glow.",
  ["4040810_2"]="However, it's not the vibrant hue of life. Instead, it resembles the cold luminescence of inorganic matter.",
  ["4040810_3"]="Normal insect eggs, despite their repulsive colors, give the impression that something is growing inside and will soon hatch.",
  ["4040810_4"]="These eggs, on the other hand, possess captivating colors but feel cold and stagnant. Whatever lies inside them has long ceased to grow.",
  ["4040810_5"]="The fluid inside the eggs has been accumulating, ready to burst at any moment.",

  ["4041201_1"]="Follow me. The situation within the city hasn't been peaceful recently. I need to take you back to WeiShi headquarters as soon as possible.",
  ["4041202_1"]="Are these things within the city, too?",
  ["4041202_2"]="Wherever water flows, they exist. Even if you clean them up every day, they just keep coming back.",
  ["4041203_1"]="The color of the water looks eerie.",
  ["4041203_2"]="It is as if a large amount of copper ions have diffused into the water, giving the river an unnatural greenish-blue hue.",
  ["4041203_3"]="The color of the water...",
  ["4041203_4"]="Strange, right? It's like someone poured dye into it.",
  ["4041203_5"]="The situation wasn't this bad a week ago. I wonder what those people going to QingYu City did, but obviously, they haven't stopped the contamination.",
  ["4041203_6"]="QingYu City?",
  ["4041203_7"]="Yeah, the origin of this anomaly is said to be QingYu City. We're affected because we're downstream, and the contamination comes from the Grandeur River.",
  ["4041204_1"]="The device is covered in bronze-colored rust as well as scratches seemingly left by sharp objects.",
  ["4041205_1"]="Now is not the time to worry about these stumps. Let's keep pushing forward.",
  ["4041205_2"]="Xin lifts her foot and forcefully stomps on a stump that is stuck in the middle.",
  ["4041401_1"]="Now the CangLin municipal government has banned residents from going outside. We've got to go from house to house to check on them.",
  ["4041401_2"]="Let's go. We have a lot of ground to cover today.",
  ["4041402_1"]="(Knock at the door)",
  ["4041402_2"]="Excuse me! I'm from the municipal-government. Can I help you with anything?",
  ["4041402_3"]="We're doing okay, but can you deliver rationed water faster?",
  ["4041402_4"]="It's already three hours late, and we're getting less water than before.",
  ["4041402_5"]="I'll report the situation.",
  ["4041402_6"]="Rationed water?",
  ["4041402_7"]="Is water rationed now?",
  ["4041402_8"]="Yeah, after the Grandeur River got contaminated, the water supply in CangLin City has been sourced from other regions.",
  ["4041402_9"]="The CangLin municipal government distributes water to the entire city, but it seems like they can't even handle such a trivial task properly. I'll report the situation to Qing.",
  ["4041403_1"]="(Knock at the door)",
  ["4041403_10"]="Yeah, a few months ago, their oldest daughter fell while crossing the street, and I carried her to the hospital.",
  ["4041403_11"]="What? Why are you giving me that look? Is it so strange that I would do something like that?",
  ["4041403_2"]="Excuse me! I'm from the municipal-government. Can I help you with anything?",
  ["4041403_3"]="Oh, is that Xin?",
  ["4041403_4"]="Huh? Oh, yeah, it's me. How's Sister Jiang been doing lately?",
  ["4041403_5"]="Don't even get me started on that. She was admitted to the hospital last month, and guess what? The gynecologist said her labor was delayed.",
  ["4041403_6"]="The doctor said it's delayed by a month. I've never heard anything like that! Thankfully, they didn't find any problems after running some checkups. I wonder if she has given birth to her baby? But we can't even visit her now.",
  ["4041403_7"]="I see. I'll ask the hospital about her situation.",
  ["4041403_8"]="Do you know them well?",
  ["4041403_9"]="Looks like you're on good terms.",
  ["4041404_1"]="What's happening? Why are there oxen in the city?",
  ["4041404_2"]="What's going on? Are these oxen going crazy or something?",
  ["4041404_3"]="Oh, it's just some farm animals that wandered into the city. I've already taken care of it, so no need to worry!",
  ["4041404_4"]="No big deal! Everyone, disperse! Go home and stay safe!",
  ["4041405_1"]="(Knock at the door)",
  ["4041405_2"]="Excuse me! I'm from the municipal-government. Can I help you with anything?",
  ["4041405_3"]="Everything is okay here. It's just lately we've started hearing strange noises in the middle of the night.",
  ["4041405_4"]="What kind of noises?",
  ["4041405_5"]="Oxen mooing, birds chirping... Hmm, I think I even heard a bear roaring last night.",
  ["4041405_6"]="A bear? But we don't have mountains in the Fertile Plains, so there shouldn't be any bears around here. You must have misheard.",
  ["4041405_7"]="Besides, do you even know what a bear's roar sounds like?",
  ["4041405_8"]="Why are you being so harsh, young lady? I mean, I've never actually seen one, but I've watched nature documentaries!",
  ["4041406_1"]="(Knock at the door)",
  ["4041406_2"]="Excuse me! I'm from the municipal-government. Can I help you with anything?",
  ["4041406_3"]="Let me out of here! I've been stuck in my house for three whole days! I can't take it anymore!",
  ["4041406_4"]="How much longer are you going to keep us cooped up at home?! Will you hold the Harvest Festival or not?!",
  ["4041406_5"]="...",
  ["4041406_6"]="Xin grips the spear in her hand tightly.",
  ["4041406_7"]="Hold on, don't do that...",
  ["4041406_8"]="Calm down.",
  ["4041406_9"]="Just as I finish speaking, we hear a rumbling noise from the distance.",
  ["4041407_1"]="Still want to go out now?",
  ["4041407_2"]="I... I...",
  ["4041407_3"]="Well, just stay home and be safe.",
  ["4041407_4"]="But what about the Harvest Festival? My kids have been looking forward to it since last month.",
  ["4041407_5"]="Sister, will we have the Harvest Festival as scheduled?",
  ["4041407_6"]="...",
  ["4041407_7"]="Don't worry. The festival will be fine.",
  ["4041408_1"]="Hold on, why are you outside? Don't you know what's happened? It's strictly forbidden to leave without permission!",
  ["4041408_2"]="I... I'm sorry... but I was so worried...",
  ["4041408_3"]="My father accidentally broke his leg while working on the farm, and now he's in the hospital.",
  ["4041408_4"]="I can't visit him because the government won't allow us to leave. Could you please check on him for me?",
  ["4041408_5"]="...",
  ["4041408_6"]="Alright, just tell us your father's name.",
  ["4041408_7"]="And go back home! Stay inside!",
  ["4041601_1"]="I forgot to ask where the Central Square is.",
  ["4041601_2"]="Oh, there's something we haven't done yet...",
  ["4041601_3"]="The initial reason for coming to the hospital was merely to ask about the resident's father's condition. No one expected so many things to happen.",
  ["4041601_4"]="Let's start by updating her on her father's condition.",
  ["4041602_1"]="Ah, it's you! Did you go to the hospital? Have you seen my father?",
  ["4041602_10"]="Like a bear... or a tiger... or some other wild animal...",
  ["4041602_11"]="...",
  ["4041602_12"]="All the more reason, you shouldn't have come out.",
  ["4041602_13"]="I'm heading home now.",
  ["4041602_14"]="Please wait a moment... where is the Central Square?",
  ["4041602_15"]="Huh, weren't you sent by the government? How come you don't know that?",
  ["4041602_16"]="We're contracted staff.",
  ["4041602_17"]="We're just some hired help.",
  ["4041602_18"]="Alright... you're talking about the square in front of <color=#fec66b>Nongsang Pavilion</color>, right? It's actually called the <color=#fec66b>Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture Square</color>.",
  ["4041602_19"]="Nongsang Pavilion is actually the <color=#fec66b>office building of the Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture</color>. When the city was constructed, all the urban areas were centered around the pavilion, and the square is part of the office complex.",
  ["4041602_2"]="No, but...",
  ["4041602_20"]="But then more and more tourists started coming there, probably because it's a popular spot for taking photos. Somehow, the square became recognized as the center of CangLin City... hence the name \"Central Square.\"",
  ["4041602_21"]="Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture?",
  ["4041602_22"]="Oh, you're wondering why the urban areas were centered around the Bureau?",
  ["4041602_23"]="Well, you can actually figure that out from the name \"CangLin,\" which means \"well-stocked larders.\"",
  ["4041602_24"]="What good is a larder without food? So naturally, the top priority here is the development of agriculture, forestry, livestock, and fisheries.",
  ["4041602_25"]="After all, hunger is the root of all problems.",
  ["4041602_26"]="By the way, while the square is open to the public, Nongsang Pavilion is off-limits to outsiders, so it's best not to approach it without authorization.",
  ["4041602_27"]="That place houses the main server network of the centralized agricultural system of this city.",
  ["4041602_28"]="The server network controls all the sprinkling, sowing, harvesting, and crop care systems within the city and Fertile Plains. The security measures are as strict as those in a military area. Stay away from that place, and you won't get in trouble.",
  ["4041602_3"]="I pass on the information I learned at the hospital.",
  ["4041602_4"]="Really? it's good to know he's safe.",
  ["4041602_5"]="Have you been waiting here all this time?",
  ["4041602_6"]="No, I did go back home.",
  ["4041602_7"]="But then I heard a loud noise outside, so I couldn't help but come out again to see what was happening.",
  ["4041602_8"]="A loud noise?",
  ["4041602_9"]="It sounded like the howling of a wild beast. Not like those oxen that wandered into the city, but more like...",
  ["4041603_1"]="The area ahead is covered in even denser fog.",
  ["4041603_10"]="What a useless bird.",
  ["4041603_11"]="I'll peck you to death!",
  ["4041603_12"]="Can you communicate with those animals?",
  ["4041603_13"]="Anyway, be careful. I... I have a bad feeling about this.",
  ["4041603_14"]="You're both avian creatures...",
  ["4041603_15"]="What a useless bird.",
  ["4041603_2"]="The fog is too thick.",
  ["4041603_3"]="Stay sharp.",
  ["4041603_4"]="A fluffy ball emerges from under Zero's cloak.",
  ["4041603_5"]="This is weird. I've had the feeling that something was off since before. It's like these animals are targeting us.",
  ["4041603_6"]="Can you communicate with those animals?",
  ["4041603_7"]="Hey! How rude! Do you really think those unenlightened, lowly creatures are capable of communicating with me?",
  ["4041603_8"]="Can you communicate with those animals?",
  ["4041603_9"]="You're both avian creatures...",
  ["4050201_1"]="Huh? Oh, it's you... Wait, where's the woman with the poker face who's been following you around all day?",
  ["4050201_10"]="Yeah, yeah. I totally agree, Master Xin.",
  ["4050201_11"]="Because I'm confident that the great Master Xin will protect me.",
  ["4050201_12"]="Here, this is for you...",
  ["4050201_13"]="I hand Xin a freshly baked meat bun from my paper bag.",
  ["4050201_14"]="...",
  ["4050201_15"]="...",
  ["4050201_16"]="Stay close. Don't get lost again like last time at the hospital.",
  ["4050201_2"]="Zero is taking a rest.",
  ["4050201_3"]="She got wounded in the Tower of Babel and shielded me from flying daggers with her body.",
  ["4050201_4"]="Since we left the Library, her incredible regeneration abilities have all but ceased, and now her recovery rate is not much faster than that of an ordinary person.",
  ["4050201_5"]="If I brought her out in her current condition, it would be unfair to her.",
  ["4050201_6"]="It surprises me that she actually agreed to let you out.",
  ["4050201_7"]="Well... I had to do some serious convincing...",
  ["4050201_8"]="Whenever I think about the look in Zero's eyes when she learned that I was going to act independently, I feel uneasy, as if I've done something wrong.",
  ["4050201_9"]="But I can't believe Qing actually let you out, especially considering the chaotic situation out there and the fact that you were attacked last time.",
  ["4050202_1"]="Since the water in the Grandeur River is contaminated, the Wellbeing Office City Hall has ordered fresh water to be transferred from other regions to CangLin City.",
  ["4050202_2"]="Until the completion of the Water Diversion Project, CangLin City will have to rely on caravans to deliver water from outside the city and manually distribute it.",
  ["4050202_3"]="We're currently short-handed, so it'd be great if you could help us out.",
  ["4050203_1"]="The Bureau of Husbandry & Agriculture wants to hold the Harvest Festival on time this year. Although the festival will be held remotely, we still want people to get some fresh air, even if it's just for one afternoon.",
  ["4050203_2"]="In that case, we need to eliminate all the contaminated animals that have invaded the city before the festival starts.",
  ["4050203_3"]="At the very least, we must ensure that the city is safe on the day of the festival.",
  ["4050204_1"]="Looks like something went down on the outskirts, and Qing asked us to stay here for now.",
  ["4050204_2"]="With so many people gathered, that must be a serious problem going on.",
  ["4050205_1"]="Are you leaving? I heard there are some problems in the neighborhood near the hospital. Perhaps you should go there and take a look.",
  ["4050206_1"]="Thank you so much! Those animals have been attacking us lately, and they delayed today's water delivery!",
  ["4050206_2"]="Are you busy? If you have the time, could you help me distribute water to the residents in this neighborhood first?",
  ["4050207_1"]="(Knock at the door)",
  ["4050207_10"]="It's actually 5 liters and 15 liters, respectively.",
  ["4050207_11"]="Xin's face turns red with embarrassment.",
  ["4050207_12"]="Well, it's not that big of a deal, alright? Now I know you're good at basic math!",
  ["4050207_13"]="Well, whatever. I get that you're swamped with everything going on.",
  ["4050207_14"]="Feel free to give our water to the family across the street. They have an old man at home and must need more water for daily care.",
  ["4050207_2"]="Excuse me! I'm from the municipal-government...",
  ["4050207_3"]="The government? Oh, you're just in time! We got five people here, and you only gave us 10 liters of drinking water and 60 liters of daily use water today. Do you think this is fair?",
  ["4050207_4"]="Huh? Wait, let me see... Each person should get 3 liters of drinking water and 15 liters of daily use water per day. And you have five people here...",
  ["4050207_5"]="Xin starts counting on her fingers but messes up.",
  ["4050207_6"]="It's 15 liters of drinking water and 75 liters of domestic water.",
  ["4050207_7"]="Oh, right!",
  ["4050207_8"]="Right? Do you have any idea how much water you've shorted us? We can't even make a decent soup!",
  ["4050207_9"]="Come on! It's only 3 liters of drinking water and 10 liters of domestic water short. I'll make up for it right away.",
  ["4050208_1"]="(Knock at the door)",
  ["4050208_2"]="Excuse me! I'm from the municipal-government. Here's your water allocation for today.",
  ["4050208_3"]="Oh? Why do we have so much water today?",
  ["4050208_4"]="Here's the thing...",
  ["4050208_5"]="So, it's from our neighbor across the street. I really appreciate it.",
  ["4050208_6"]="Actually, my old man doesn't need so much water. He's been losing his appetite lately, even though he's in good health.",
  ["4050208_7"]="I mean, he's already in his eighties, and I'm worried he might be on his last legs...",
  ["4050208_8"]="Please, take the water and give it to those who need it, especially the people at the hospital.",
  ["4050209_1"]="Are you from the government? We really could use your help! Come here!",
  ["4050209_2"]="See that bus parked on the roadside? We were intending to use it to transport some patients out of the city.",
  ["4050209_3"]="But those beasts are too dangerous. Could you get rid of them? Here, the permission to the barricades...",
  ["4050210_1"]="There are some obstacles up ahead blocking the road.",
  ["4050210_2"]="If I try to drive through, the bus will get damaged, and the patients inside might get hurt. Could you help me clear the road?",
  ["4050401_1"]="The Bureau of Roads & Travel is transporting stored grain to various regions, and all highways and railroads are at full capacity. The Wellbeing Office is coordinating with other regions to ensure that transportation fleets from CangLin City are given priority.",
  ["4050401_2"]="But recently, the biological mutations caused by the water have intensified, and contaminated animals have started attacking transportation fleets and workers constantly.",
  ["4050401_3"]="Ordinary people can barely perceive anomalies. They can't see the true nature of what we see and can't defend themselves against such attacks.",
  ["4050401_4"]="We need to escort them until all the resources are safely delivered.",
  ["4050502_1"]="Those oxen's hooves are getting harder. They can even smash through thick pipes.",
  ["4050502_2"]="All of a sudden, Qing discovers something as she squats down, touching the water on the ground with her fingertips.",
  ["4050502_3"]="Hmm? What's happening here? The water...",
  ["4050502_4"]="What's wrong?",
  ["4050502_5"]="Oh, nothing. Let's fix the water pipes first.",
  ["4050503_1"]="These barricades were probably set up by the construction team. Let's move them out of the way for now.",
  ["4050504_1"]="The water pipes here are badly damaged.",
  ["4050504_2"]="Qing squats down again and touches the water that has accumulated under the leaking water pipes.",
  ["4050504_3"]="It's not my imagination. The water here is the contaminated water from the Grandeur River.",
  ["4050504_4"]="She wipes the water off her hand and then catches a handful of water below the leaking water pipe.",
  ["4050504_5"]="The water inside the pipe is clean.",
  ["4050504_6"]="So, someone deliberately spread the contaminated water around the pipes to attract those animals.",
  ["4050504_7"]="Who... who would do such a thing?",
  ["4050504_8"]="Let's focus on fixing the pipes for now.",
  ["4050504_9"]="Yeah, you're right. It's pointless to think about the culprit now.",
  ["4050505_1"]="Lift the barricades and let the construction team evacuate.",
  ["4050506_1"]="Thanks a lot. If it weren't for you, who knows when we would've finished fixing these pipes.",
  ["4050506_2"]="You're welcome.",
  ["4050506_3"]="By the way, have you noticed any suspicious behavior from your team members?",
  ["4050506_4"]="Well, I don't remember everyone. It's a temporary engineering team, after all...",
  ["4051101_1"]="It's dangerous outside. Just go home and stay safe.",
  ["4051101_2"]="But isn't the Harvest Festival coming up? Why won't you let us out?",
  ["4051101_3"]="We're still clearing the streets and setting up the venue. Please go back and wait for further notice...",
  ["4051101_4"]="I promise the festival will happen on time.",
  ["4051102_1"]="Xin, can you hear me? There's an emergency!",
  ["4051102_2"]="Someone in the next block is under attack. I've sent you the coordinates. Go help them!",
  ["4051103_1"]="Don't you see how dangerous it is outside? Why don't you stay at home?!",
  ["4051103_2"]="Forget about the festival! Didn't I tell you to stay home until it starts? It's not time yet!",
  ["4051103_3"]="I... I'm sorry... I was just thinking if I could help clear the streets...",
  ["4051103_4"]="You guys seem to be short-staffed, so I thought I could help you in my own way...",
  ["4051103_5"]="...",
  ["4051103_6"]="By the way, I saw someone climbing onto a rooftop and heading towards the square...",
  ["4051103_7"]="I don't know if it's a thief or what, but it seems dangerous. I mean, we're not in ancient times. Who knows those acrobatic moves anymore?",
  ["4051103_8"]="...!",
  ["4051103_9"]="Alright, just go home already!",
  ["4051401_1"]="It went towards the Central Square.",
  ["4051401_2"]="Isn't that where we're headed?",
  ["4051401_3"]="...",
  ["4060202_1"]="Seriously, who's calling me now when I'm out on patrol?",
  ["4060202_10"]="But visitors being allowed into the city at this hour, with Master Yuanquan personally instructing me to retrieve them... They must be someone significant. I wonder who they could be?",
  ["4060202_2"]="Hello? Hello... Oh?!",
  ["4060202_3"]="Azi immediately changes her tone upon hearing the voice on the other end of the phone.",
  ["4060202_4"]="This is Tang Zi speaking, Your Excellency.",
  ["4060202_5"]="I'm currently patrolling the business district. Everything is under control, and all the residents have been evacuated.",
  ["4060202_6"]="Hmmm? Do you have guests, Your Excellency?",
  ["4060202_7"]="Understood. I'll head down immediately to meet them.",
  ["4060202_8"]="...",
  ["4060202_9"]="...Phew, that scared me! Note to self: Check the caller ID before picking up next time.",
  ["4060203_1"]="Hey, it's you, Azi! Heard you from a distance.",
  ["4060203_2"]="Hey, what do you mean by that? I made sure not to get too loud this time! I'm not Xin!",
  ["4060203_3"]="By the way, the evacuation should be done by now. Aren't you leaving?",
  ["4060203_4"]="There was a family of elderly couples who couldn't move easily. I assisted them in leaving the city and got delayed.",
  ["4060203_5"]="The evacuation here is going smoothly, but the residents halfway up the hillside are quite a challenge...",
  ["4060203_6"]="Ah, those people... They can be quite difficult.",
  ["4060203_7"]="I'll go check on them when I head back down. You can head back first.",
  ["4060204_1"]="Whew, we're only halfway up, and managing the mist and animals is already proving tough.",
  ["4060204_2"]="The mist at the bottom of the mountain seems denser. I've got to be more careful.",
  ["4060301_1"]="Azi? What's the hurry?",
  ["4060301_2"]="Master Yuanquan instructed me to escort some guests down the mountain.",
  ["4060301_3"]="Got it. I'll open the gate for you here.",
  ["4060301_4"]="By the way, if you go further up, you might encounter some Tianli residents who haven't evacuated... Try to persuade them and avoid any conflicts.",
  ["4060301_5"]="Understood.",
  ["4060302_1"]="Hmm... where did those people go? They're not here.",
  ["4060302_10"]="...Well, it's a complicated story! Not something I can explain easily!",
  ["4060302_11"]="Azi ponders for a moment but struggles to find a simple way to explain it.",
  ["4060302_12"]="Regardless, we won't leave until we have a confirmed return date.",
  ["4060302_13"]="I'm busy now, so if you have nothing else, don't get in my way.",
  ["4060302_14"]="...Alright, is there anything I can help you with?",
  ["4060302_15"]="You're not a local here, right? You're not as familiar with this place as we are, so just stop causing trouble for us.",
  ["4060302_16"]="The resident vanishes in the blink of an eye.",
  ["4060302_2"]="Hey, I'm in charge of the evacuation operations here...",
  ["4060302_3"]="Ah, it's you folks again. Spare us the lecture, we're tired of it. I have a few questions to ask.",
  ["4060302_4"]="What questions?",
  ["4060302_5"]="How long do we need to stay in the evacuation zone? And when can we return?",
  ["4060302_6"]="We haven't received any updates yet...until the mist clears at least.",
  ["4060302_7"]="But the weather forecast just keeps saying \"the date of mist clearing is uncertain.\"",
  ["4060302_8"]="Because this isn't just any extreme weather! There's something more to it!",
  ["4060302_9"]="Something more? Heh, tell me about it.",
  ["4060303_1"]="Hey, I'm in charge of the evacuation operations here...",
  ["4060303_2"]="I'm busy. Just spare me the speech.",
  ["4060303_3"]="It's not safe to stay in the city with the mist on Mount Tianque.",
  ["4060303_4"]="Come on, it's just ordinary mist! What could possibly go wrong? Outsiders like you always stir up trouble for no reason, but we...",
  ["4060303_5"]="The thick mist swirls, accompanied by eerie sounds from deep within.",
  ["4060304_1"]="Huh? Where did everyone go?",
  ["4060304_2"]="It feels like they were searching for something...",
  ["4060304_3"]="Let's put that aside for now. Following Master Yuanquan's orders is my top priority.",
  ["4060304_4"]="Hey, I wonder if those guests have reached the foot of the mountain yet.",
  ["4060305_1"]="The mist ahead is too dense... Let's see, maybe I should use the <color=#fec66b>Mist-clearing Lamp</color> for us WeiShi members.",
  ["4060305_2"]="This device is designed to filter out anomalous substances from water.",
  ["4060305_3"]="We didn't have enough time to develop devices that completely remove these substances, but this one can condense the vapor from Cerulean Water back into liquid.",
  ["4060501_1"]="Before we leave, I need to report to Master Yuanquan. Please wait here for a moment.",
  ["4060501_2"]="This is Tang Zi speaking, Your Excellency.... Hmm? What's going on? The call just...",
  ["4060501_3"]="Got cut off?",
  ["4060501_4"]="Signal's unstable?",
  ["4060501_5"]="Could it be due to the Cerulean Vapor?",
  ["4060501_6"]="Yes, the signals have been erratic since the Cerulean Vapor emerged. Let's try to move halfway up the mountain.",
  ["4060501_7"]="Let's move. I need to get you back before sunset, or things will become much trickier.",
  ["4060502_1"]="Thank you for saving my skin.",
  ["4060502_10"]="Huh? Are we really going to help them? I'm supposed to ensure your safety on the mountain top...",
  ["4060502_11"]="This will surely make the headlines.",
  ["4060502_12"]="This could boost your reputation...",
  ["4060502_13"]="Aren't you eager for more followers?",
  ["4060502_14"]="Alright, fine! I'll post this: \"Tianli Clan receives aid from Tang Sect! #QingYu City #Hanze Region #Daily #Tianli Clan #Tang Sect.\"",
  ["4060502_2"]="You're welcome... Wait, aren't you the guy who told me to \"spare the lecture\"? I did ask you to leave, didn't I? Why are you still here?!",
  ["4060502_3"]="...",
  ["4060502_4"]="Calm down.",
  ["4060502_5"]="What happened?",
  ["4060502_6"]="We're staying here because a kid from our clan sneaked off.",
  ["4060502_7"]="I know this sounds arrogant. We were overly confident in our abilities.",
  ["4060502_8"]="So, could you please help...",
  ["4060502_9"]="Certainly, even if you hadn't asked, we were intending to help. Just head back, and we'll find your child.",
  ["4060503_1"]="After defeating the beasts influenced by Cerulean Water, a little boy rushes towards us and throws himself into the man's arms.",
  ["4060503_10"]="I might not be a warrior, but we have skilled fighters. As long as we remain within our ancestral mansion, we will handle those beasts.",
  ["4060503_11"]="Azi pulls Xin aside.",
  ["4060503_12"]="You know, Xin? Before leaving my sect, I heard that the Tianli Clan has deep roots in QingYu City, and they're even more stubborn than the old-timers in my sect.",
  ["4060503_13"]="Master Yuanquan also mentioned that the Tianli people are unique, and if they choose to stay, we should leave them be.",
  ["4060503_14"]="What? But what about their safety?",
  ["4060503_15"]="Master Yuanquan didn't spill many details, but he didn't seem too concerned. Maybe those people know how to look out for themselves...",
  ["4060503_16"]="Anyway, according to Master Yuanquan, as long as the Tianli people stick to their ancestral mansion, they should be fine.",
  ["4060503_17"]="Ugh, so annoying... Fine, let's just follow that old man's words. Hey, we'll make sure you get home safely!",
  ["4060503_18"]="Thank you so much! This way, please. There's a shortcut to our ancestral mansion.",
  ["4060503_2"]="Thank you for saving the kid. I can never repay you enough. Please join us in our humble abode and let us express our gratitude properly.",
  ["4060503_3"]="That's unnecessary. Just take your boy and leave QingYu City.",
  ["4060503_4"]="Even if you were hesitant to leave, you understand the situation now, right?",
  ["4060503_5"]="I... I'm afraid we can't leave.",
  ["4060503_6"]="QingYu City holds the legacy of my clan's ancestors. We can't just abandon it.",
  ["4060503_7"]="But we're not asking you to abandon your homeland. You can come back once everything is resolved, right?",
  ["4060503_8"]="But it's our duty to protect our homeland in times of danger.",
  ["4060503_9"]="This person... Didn't those crazy animals teach you anything?!",
  ["4060504_1"]="Why are there still people stuck in the city? Need a hand getting out, old man?",
  ["4060504_2"]="Thanks, but I'm good. Thank you for opening the door. I can find my way back.",
  ["4060504_3"]="The old man turns down Xin's offer and soon disappears.",
  ["4060504_4"]="Man, he walks fast! Something is weird about him, though.",
  ["4060504_5"]="He's from the Tianli Clan... Anyway, let's leave them be. Those people are a bit mysterious.",
  ["4060504_6"]="Tianli Clan?",
  ["4060504_7"]="Yep, ancient clan in QingYu City. We might bump into them again.",
  ["4060504_8"]="Master Yuanquan has emphasized that we should respect their decision unless things get really hairy.",
  ["4060801_1"]="Please don't mind it if our patriarch gives you a long face. He's just going through a rebellious phase and has a bad temper, and we'll sort him out later.",
  ["4060801_2"]="Oh, hey! Aren't you an influencer? Feel free to post pictures on your socials here. We're thinking of turning some cabins into a restaurant...",
  ["4060801_3"]="But you know, those buildings are too ancient, and dealing with the Bureau of Cultural Relics and those fire regulations is a headache...",
  ["4060801_4"]="You've got a sharp eye for business, but why is your patriarch looking like he's totally out of the loop?",
  ["4060801_5"]="Are you... keeping him in the dark about all this?",
  ["4060801_6"]="Shh, keep it down! If he knew our financial situation, he'd be asking for a raise in his pocket money...",
  ["4060801_7"]="Pocket money? But I thought he was the patriarch?",
  ["4060801_8"]="Well, he's still young and naive about society. To ensure he develops good spending habits, we older clan members must manage the finances for him...",
  ["4060801_9"]="That's quite the limited patriarch. Good thing it's not like that in my sect...",
  ["4060802_1"]="Those new jewelry pieces are flying off the shelves! They sold very well during the last livestream. I knew our patriarch was a great model. Next time, put some new product on him while he's still asleep.",
  ["4060802_2"]="Careful. If he catches you filming him live online secretly, he'll be furious.",
  ["4060802_3"]="Furious? Then he can kiss his new console and games goodbye next month! That kid doesn't appreciate who's working hard to afford his luxuries!",
  ["4060802_4"]="...I'd never want to be a clan leader like this.",
  ["4060803_1"]="We need a new toilet in one of the guest rooms. You handle the paperwork this time.",
  ["4060803_2"]="What? Me again?! I'm done with the Bureau of Cultural Relics! They're driving me insane!",
  ["4060803_3"]="Ah, this darn house! Every brick is cataloged by the Bureau! We need a pile of reports just to make a change!",
  ["4060803_4"]="And you see the walls? Even they're considered cultural relics and protected! So no painting, no writing, no nails, no wires, no posters... no nothing!",
  ["4060803_5"]="In short, it has to remain exactly as it was built, now, and forever!",
  ["4060803_6"]="Can you believe it? Even in this day and age, they won't even let the telecom company install a signal tower! \"It affects the ancient aesthetics,\" they say...",
  ["4060803_7"]="...",
  ["4060803_8"]="That actually happened!",
  ["4060804_1"]="The water's all good. Next month, I'll upgrade the nitrification system. If it wasn't for maintaining the water flow, I'd turn it into a pond and raise fish...",
  ["4060804_10"]="Well, even though we don't use water from the Tianchi Lake, we hope this crisis eases up soon... The government staff really needs to step it up.",
  ["4060804_2"]="The water here looks crystal clear.",
  ["4060804_3"]="Yeah... Oh, you're the patriarch's guests.",
  ["4060804_4"]="The water here differs from that of the Tianchi Lake... Pure, untouched by pollution.",
  ["4060804_5"]="Of course, we source our water independently.",
  ["4060804_6"]="Our ancestors strictly forbade us from drinking the Tianchi Lake's water.",
  ["4060804_7"]="Back in the day, we had to divert water from far-off mountains, and now those canals are cultural relics.",
  ["4060804_8"]="Everything is much simpler these days. Just hook up the pipe to any water source that's not the Tianchi Lake, and it's done! You can even order barrels of waters online! Modern life is so convenient!",
  ["4060804_9"]="Our ancestors really put in the work for this water pipe! But well, it's just one pipe, won't cut it for the whole QingYu City.",
  ["4060805_1"]="Legend has it this mansion was constructed in the era of our first forefather, Li Jun.",
  ["4060805_2"]="That was when Ji Xia first unified the land.",
  ["4060805_3"]="Short after Ji Xia took the throne, he jetted off on a grand tour, leaving Li Jun to hold things down in QingYu City as regent.",
  ["4060805_4"]="Li Jun met a mysterious end shortly after taking the reins, and all that remained of him was this mansion. Through fires, quakes, and battles, it's been battered but always rebuilt in the same spot.",
  ["4060805_5"]="This place is our foundation. Throughout history, numerous emperors have tried to uproot us, shuffle us off to cities or distant lands.",
  ["4060805_6"]="But here we are, standing firm. Our first patriarch Li Jun decreed that we never abandon QingYu City...",
  ["4060805_7"]="And look at us now! While our rivals have crumbled to dust, we stand strong. And we'll stand for ages to come!",

  ["4060901_11"]="...Alright, I'll go with you.",
  ["4060901_2"]="That sound is coming from the back of the mountain.",
  ["4060901_3"]="Hold on...",
  ["4060901_4"]="Look, there are footprints here on the ground.",
  ["4060901_5"]="...And they look like a child's footprints.",
  ["4060901_6"]="Oh, no...",
  ["4060901_7"]="Could it be the same kid from earlier today...?",
  ["4060901_8"]="We shouldn't intrude on their sacred land.",

  ["4060902_1"]="Hey, look! It's the outsider!",
  ["4060902_10"]="But my friends said they heard some strange noises behind that gate, so I got curious too...",
  ["4060902_11"]="Maybe there's some sort of monster sealed there? *Yawn* Ahh, I'm feeling sleepy...",
  ["4060902_12"]="It's getting late. We'll take you back home.",
  ["4060902_13"]="We can explore this place together another time.",
  ["4060902_14"]="The child doesn't say anything more, just snuggles into my arms and drifts off to sleep.",
  ["4060902_15"]="Soon, the sound of his soft snores fills the air.",
  ["4060902_2"]="I recognize that face. It's the same child we rescued earlier today.",
  ["4060902_3"]="Why are you still out at this hour?",
  ["4060902_4"]="That's the question I should be asking you.",
  ["4060902_5"]="Because I'm here to take you back.",
  ["4060902_6"]="Ah, just don't tell my parents! I was so bored that I sneaked out of the window.",
  ["4060902_7"]="Where are we?",
  ["4060902_8"]="What's behind that stone gate?",
  ["4060902_9"]="I don't know either, but the adults always warned us to stay out of there.",
  ["4060903_1"]="As we exit the bamboo forest, a teenager's silhouette emerges through the mist.",
  ["4060903_2"]="The familiar jingle of silver pendants resonates in the air.",
  ["4060903_3"]="At this moment, he is surrounded by a pack of beasts on the verge of attacking him.",
  ["4060903_4"]="So, it's you... Stay back. Leave those beasts to me.",
  ["4060903_5"]="...And we'll discuss your intrusion into our sacred lands later.",
  ["4061101_1"]="So, this device releases compressed air in all directions to scatter the mist.",
  ["4061101_2"]="Now, let's use this lamp to disperse some Cerulean Vapors and refill these purification devices with the compressed air that should have been released.",
  ["4061101_3"]="By the way, if you get the angle just right, you can refill several purification devices at once.",
  ["4061101_4"]="Placeholder for Text",
  ["4061102_1"]="Alright, we should have some peace for a little while. Let me reach out to Master Yuanquan for now.",
  ["4061102_10"]="The call concludes.",
  ["4061102_11"]="Azi's serious expression immediately transforms into a playful grin.",
  ["4061102_12"]="Let's go ahead. You heard Master Yuanquan, right? He's waiting for you.",
  ["4061102_2"]="A series of beeps emanate from Azi's phone.",
  ["4061102_3"]="This is Tang Zi speaking, Your Excellency. Last night, we encountered Cerulean Vapor and rampaging beasts, so we had to seek refuge at the Tianli Clan to ensure the Head Librarian's safety. It was a hasty decision, and I regret not being able to inform you promptly.",
  ["4061102_4"]="No worries. Your quick thinking was commendable.",
  ["4061102_5"]="How are you and the Head Librarian faring now?",
  ["4061102_6"]="All is well.",
  ["4061102_7"]="I'm awaiting you at the heart of the royal palace. Please escort our esteemed Head Librarian there.",
  ["4061102_8"]="You will be passing through the dam, and the situation there can be precarious. It's essential to protect the Head Librarian and deliver our esteemed guest to me safely.",
  ["4061102_9"]="Sure.",
  ["4061201_1"]="Royal Palace",
  ["4061201_10"]="We took great efforts in repairing them, but by then, the polluted water had already seeped downstream.",
  ["4061201_11"]="Fortunately, it appears the repairs are nearly complete now. Once we overcome this crisis, we'll reopen the gates and restore the picturesque surroundings.",
  ["4061201_3"]="As we traverse the street, a sheer cliff looms ahead.",
  ["4061201_4"]="We're almost there. Once we climb up here, it's the restricted area open only to royal members.",
  ["4061201_5"]="I remember reading a book about the royal palace in QingYu City.",
  ["4061201_6"]="It detailed a perennial waterfall cascading from the mountain and merging into the Grandeur River.",
  ["4061201_7"]="Yep, and this is the very waterfall the book talked about. It originates from the Tianchi Lake atop the mountain where the palace is located.",
  ["4061201_8"]="When the crisis broke out, we pinpointed the Tianchi Lake as the pollution source, so we promptly sealed the sluice gates to halt the flow.",
  ["4061201_9"]="However, the water infrastructure in QingYu City is ancient, left largely unaltered due to its historical value. So, when we attempted to shut the gates, we discovered many of them weren't functioning properly...",
  ["4061202_1"]="Placeholder for Text",
  ["4061202_2"]="The sluice gates were recently repaired, but these repairs were temporary and lacked foolproof assurances...",
  ["4061202_3"]="With Cerulean Water now pooled here, the Cerulean Vapor is notably intense. Please be careful.",
  ["4061202_4"]="Another of our member will meet you on the opposite side.",
  ["4061203_1"]="Please just go ahead and avoid lingering here. The dam is still undergoing repairs, and its stability is uncertain.",
  ["4061203_2"]="Moreover, we've detected seismic activity near Mount Tianque.",
  ["4061203_3"]="So, you mean... an earthquake?",
  ["4061203_4"]="Hopefully not, but the chances are significant.",
  ["4061204_1"]="This must be Master Yuanquan's esteemed guest.",
  ["4061204_2"]="Exactly. I'm escorting [BBNAME] for an audience with His Excellency.",
  ["4061204_3"]="Behind me is a hidden passage leading to the royal palace. Please pass through it.",
  ["4061205_1"]="The green glazed tiles shimmer under the clear sky, reminiscent of newly forged dragon scales.",
  ["4061205_10"]="Ah, here comes our guide.",
  ["4061205_11"]="Here! Ming! Ming Xiaomin!",
  ["4061205_12"]="Fondly called by Azi, the girl shows a mix of weariness and indifference, giving a brief nod before approaching me.",
  ["4061205_13"]="Esteemed Head Librarian and Zero, I'm Ming from WeiShi, assigned by Master Yuanquan to lead you through the royal palace.",
  ["4061205_14"]="The palace has a complex layout, so please stick close to me to avoid getting lost.",
  ["4061205_15"]="True to Ming's words, upon entering the city gates, I see a maze of pathways, each building grand in its own way, making it hard to discern their purposes from the outside.",
  ["4061205_16"]="In ancient times, not only did the emperor live here, but all the government offices were also housed within these walls.",
  ["4061205_17"]="This pathway used to be the ministers' route to the court, linking to the main hall by the Tianchi Lake. Unfortunately, it's now submerged due to neglect.",
  ["4061205_18"]="This way leads to the Lake Observation Pavilion, that one to the Royal Library, and the pavilion on the other side was for military matters...",
  ["4061205_19"]="Ming enumerates these details as we progress.",
  ["4061205_2"]="If Tianli Mansion embodies profound history, this place exudes an aura of unyielding grandeur.",
  ["4061205_20"]="Your knowledge is truly impressive, Ming.",
  ["4061205_21"]="Zero looks amazed, while Ming tilts her head slightly.",
  ["4061205_22"]="Well, it's just part of my job.",
  ["4061205_23"]="When not on WeiShi duties, I delve into folklore and relics research, specializing in QingYu City's ancient history.",
  ["4061205_24"]="Ming! Ming!",
  ["4061205_25"]="Why not explore Shu customs? You have a Tang Sect member right here for firsthand information!",
  ["4061205_26"]="I promise you exclusive insights! You could write numerous essays from what I share! Fame and recognition await!",
  ["4061205_27"]="Not interested.",
  ["4061205_28"]="You're only after publicity. Forget it, I won't be part of your camera show.",
  ["4061205_29"]="Alas, another failed attempt to sway our Ming Xiaomin.",
  ["4061205_3"]="The golden platform, jade pavilion, and towers adorned with dragons and phoenixes... all suggest that this place was the emperor's residence.",
  ["4061205_30"]="Your desire for exposure is quite evident.",
  ["4061205_31"]="Abruptly, their banter ceases.",
  ["4061205_32"]="We've arrived.",
  ["4061205_33"]="The vista expands, leading to a grand square bordered by azure waters and ancient pines. The distant snow-capped peaks glisten in the clear daylight.",
  ["4061205_34"]="Tianchi Lake",
  ["4061205_35"]="A figure stands erect by the lakeside, his silver hair indicating advanced age as he appears lost in contemplation.",
  ["4061205_36"]="All the WeiShi members stop their steps with reverence.",
  ["4061205_37"]="Please go ahead, Head Librarian.",
  ["4061205_38"]="Master Yuanquan is expecting you and Zero's arrival. We won't be accompanying you any further.",
  ["4061205_39"]="No worries, that old man... I mean, Master Yuanquan is friendly and won't give you a hard time.",
  ["4061205_4"]="Before the collapse of the old Qian Empire, the palace was the heart of the vast land for millennia.",
  ["4061205_40"]="Understood.",
  ["4061205_41"]="As I move towards the elder, a cold wind brushes my face, sending a shiver down my spine.",
  ["4061205_42"]="The height atop Mount QingYu is so great that the air feels thin.",
  ["4061205_43"]="Once again, I can't help but recall the question I had when I first saw this mountain.",
  ["4061205_44"]="What did the emperor, who chose this location for his capital, see in this lake that led him to place his bronze throne atop this snowy mountain, secluded from the hustle and bustle of the world?",
  ["4061205_5"]="\"Choose the world's heart for founding a nation, and choose the nation's core for erecting a palace.\"",
  ["4061205_6"]="This was Ji Xia's message to his people when he decided to establish his capital here.",
  ["4061205_7"]="Over the centuries, it has grown and transformed into what we see today.",
  ["4061205_8"]="\"All monarchs bowed, kingdoms melded as one. Atop Mount Tianque gleams QingYu, the sun.\" This excerpt stems from the \"Poem of QingYu City\" written by an ancient scholar. Quite remarkable, isn't it?",
  ["4061205_9"]="A girl holding a peculiar staff is standing at the gates.",
  ["4061601_1"]="Thanks to your help, we've managed to stop the leakage, at least for now.",
  ["4061601_10"]="...",
  ["4061601_11"]="...",
  ["4061601_12"]="Why so quiet? Did I say something funny again?",
  ["4061601_13"]="...No. Your mind is surprisingly sharp at times.",
  ["4061601_14"]="Oh, now that you mention it... the dam here seems like it was once a bridge encased in stone for construction.",
  ["4061601_15"]="Was this construction method ever used in the past, Ming?",
  ["4061601_16"]="No, at least not to my knowledge. It doesn't make sense. Why would one build a bridge if the intention was a dam in the first place?",
  ["4061601_17"]="Unless there was already a bridge there.",
  ["4061601_18"]="So, it's like converting a bridge into a dam?",
  ["4061601_19"]="We don't have all the details yet, but the Head Librarian's guess is right. Our survey suggests the dam was originally a bridge.",
  ["4061601_2"]="I haven't read about the reconstruction of the dam at Tianchi Lake. I just saw the structure and have a question, if you don't mind.",
  ["4061601_20"]="Consequently, its structure is quite different from a standard dam, making repairs extremely challenging.",
  ["4061601_21"]="Without specialized equipment for flaw detection, our current fixes are temporary, and even minor geological shifts could undermine the structure again.",
  ["4061601_22"]="Weren't you going to retrieve the lost drop box? It's nearby, and we've located it and sent you the coordinates.",
  ["4061601_3"]="This structure doesn't look like the typical engineering design one would expect for a weir or dam.",
  ["4061601_4"]="And it's not mentioned in ancient architectural texts like \"On Construction Regulations\" or \"Standardized Commandments.\"",
  ["4061601_5"]="...As expected of you, Ming. You've already caught so much with just one glance.",
  ["4061601_6"]="Hey, what's all this about? Sounds pretty complicated!",
  ["4061601_7"]="Ming's talking about those ancient engineering books that set standards... You know what? Forget it, Xin. Just stay naive and innocent.",
  ["4061601_8"]="Whatever, if you don't want to explain just don't pick on me",
  ["4061601_9"]="But to me, the wood looks like a bridge, right? And if you remove those stones, the gaps would match a bridge, don't you think?",
  ["4061602_1"]="The small lotuses are blooming, and fish are swimming in the water. Nothing seems out of the ordinary.",
  ["4061603_1"]="The house stands empty.",
  ["4061604_1"]="Wait, there's something in the grass!... Oh, this must be it!",
  ["4070201_1"]="That old geezer! He didn't give us a single useful lead! This place is huge. Where the heck are we supposed to even start?!",
  ["4070201_10"]="If you don't mind your account getting banned, go ahead and post that.",
  ["4070201_11"]="Ming ignores the two troublemakers and turns to me instead.",
  ["4070201_12"]="Head Librarian, Master Yuanquan has asked me to assist you. If there's anything I can do, just say the word.",
  ["4070201_13"]="Alright.",
  ["4070201_14"]="I'll be counting on you.",
  ["4070201_15"]="Ah, didn't expect you'd actually need my help… Guess I should've just kept my mouth shut.",
  ["4070201_16"]="Huuh?",
  ["4070201_17"]="What did you just say?",
  ["4070201_18"]="Zero has been quietly observing the towering structures ever since we arrived.",
  ["4070201_19"]="Where should we start?",
  ["4070201_2"]="Ugh! I get it if they talk in riddles with Eme-ans, but come on, we're part of WeiShi! Why do our own people have to be so mysterious too?!",
  ["4070201_21"]="Let's get moving.",
  ["4070201_22"]="That makes sense.",
  ["4070201_23"]="Kanjiang Pavilion?",
  ["4070201_24"]="If it were up to me, I'd start with Kanjiang Pavilion.",
  ["4070201_25"]="Over there, do you see it? That tall, tower-like structure.",
  ["4070201_26"]="It's said that Ji Xia built it to honor the meritorious officials of his time, and their portraits still hang inside as a testament to their legacy.",
  ["4070201_27"]="The tradition carried on with every emperor after that. For nobles and high-ranking officials, getting their portrait in Kanjiang Pavilion was the ultimate honor.",
  ["4070201_28"]="The Imperial Seal is a symbol of power, something the First Emperor always kept with him. If we're looking for it, the best place to start is with the people closest to him—his inner circle in the Xia Dynasty.",
  ["4070201_3"]="Ming approaches us slowly, holding a lantern.",
  ["4070201_5"]="If he already knows the answer, why didn't he just tell us? Why do we have to solve some stupid puzzle?! I haven't even finished my basic education!",
  ["4070201_6"]="His reasons! Every day it's the same nonsense. Someone's always got some reason. I'm about to lose it with all these \"reasons\"!",
  ["4070201_7"]="If Master Yuanquan refuses to speak of it, he must have his reasons.",
  ["4070201_8"]="Nearby, Azi is busy posing for a shot.",
  ["4070201_9"]="\"Join this Tang Sect disciple for a special insider's tour of the QingYu Imperial Palace! Get a sneak peek at the restricted areas of the imperial palace that are off-limits to the public!\"",
  ["4070202_1"]="The path ahead is blocked by more of those Cerulean Crystals. Ugh, what a pain. These things are the worst to deal with.",
  ["4070202_2"]="But if they're left unhandled for too long, they harden into something extremely difficult to break.",
  ["4070202_3"]="Cerulean Crystals are basically mineral deposits from condensed water and mist. The fresh ones have a brighter color and are less compact.",
  ["4070202_4"]="Don't worry. The Mist-clearing Lamp absorbs high concentrations of cerulean mist and turns it back into liquid. The crystallized cerulean residue gets stored, and the dried air is compressed.",
  ["4070202_5"]="Once released, the compressed air is strong enough to shatter the crystals.",
  ["4070202_6"]="That's some next-level tech...",
  ["4070202_7"]="That's a bit overkill...",
  ["4070202_8"]="We should be careful using it.",
  ["4070203_1"]="It's... locked.",
  ["4070203_2"]="When we evacuated the residents, we activated security measures at key historical sites to protect cultural relics.",
  ["4070203_3"]="But these security systems are usually managed by the Bureau of Cultural Relics. While we know how to activate them, we have no idea how to turn it off…",
  ["4070203_4"]="The original plan was for their staff to take care of it when they got back.",
  ["4070203_5"]="Oh, looks like it's my time to shine!",
  ["4070203_6"]="Azi holds Xin back, giving Ming a pleading look.",
  ["4070203_7"]="Ming lazily lifts her gaze.",
  ["4070203_8"]="Let me take a look... Well, I know a thing or two about this kind of lock.",
  ["4070203_9"]="Hmm? I hear something nearby. Clear the area while I'm cracking this.",
  ["4070301_1"]="Wait a sec. This hexagonal censer seems a bit off. Let me take a closer look.",
  ["4070301_2"]="There's a mechanism inside the base of the censer. It looks like a master switch. If I clear out this frost mist, it should start working again.",
  ["4070302_1"]="More crystal clusters! Ugh, the Mist-clearing Lamp's low on air. Let's see if there's anywhere nearby that needs to be purified first.",
  ["4070303_1"]="I didn't think the mist would be this thick indoors... Let's purify this area first. We might need the compressed air later.",
  ["4070304_1"]="The door won't open from this side.",
  ["4070304_2"]="Someone must've locked it from the other side. Let's go the other way.",
  ["4070304_3"]="Who in the world decided to put a one-way door here?!",
  ["4070305_1"]="I get it now. The lever triggers the mechanisms on both sides.",
  ["4070305_2"]="We need to keep the right-side stairs stationary while rotating the door on the left. So, we gotta find a way to stop the mechanism on the right from moving.",
  ["4070305_3"]="There's a hexagonal censer next to the mechanism on the right, Miss Ming.",
  ["4070501_1"]="Below Kanjiang Pavilion, the imperial causeway stretches toward the palace.",
  ["4070501_10"]="Let's treat that burn first.",
  ["4070501_11"]="Has the Taiye Pool always been this hot?",
  ["4070501_12"]="Ming stops lounging and gives Xin a serious look.",
  ["4070501_13"]="Don't be so reckless. The palace grounds are complex, and with the recent seismic activity, if you fall into a pool, we might never even fish out your bones.",
  ["4070501_14"]="It's not supposed to be so hot. Normally, the Taiye Pool's temperature stays stable.",
  ["4070501_15"]="I've never seen a hot spring before, let alone one in a royal garden...",
  ["4070501_16"]="Azi chimes in as she tends to Xin's burned hand.",
  ["4070501_17"]="Lately, increased geothermal activity from Mount Tianque has caused the ground to crack in multiple places. As a result, the Pool has been overheating, and hot steam is rising from various cracks.",
  ["4070501_18"]="The water is averaging seventy-three degrees now, and it's still rising. Don't go wandering off unless you want to boil yourself alive.",
  ["4070501_19"]="Could someone be behind this?",
  ["4070501_2"]="The fastest way to Wencheng Pavilion is through the Imperial Garden.",
  ["4070501_20"]="Is it possible that an external force triggered this?",
  ["4070501_21"]="Hmm... You do have a knack for asking interesting questions.",
  ["4070501_22"]="Ordinarily, I'd say no. Geological shifts aren't something people can just cause overnight.",
  ["4070501_23"]="But the timing of all this is too coincidental, so I suppose your guess might not be entirely off after all.",
  ["4070501_24"]="It's hard to say; we're still investigating. Some geothermal sources deep underground may have become active again. Until we understand the geological shifts here, stay cautious and don't wander off.",
  ["4070501_25"]="We'll go around the outer walls of the garden. That's the safest route. Please follow me, Head Librarian.",
  ["4070501_26"]="Stone Tablet",
  ["4070501_3"]="However, it's not exactly safe to pass through right now.",
  ["4070501_4"]="Looking in the direction Ming pointed, I see a misty haze rising behind the faint outline of the trees. The path leading to the imperial garden soon disappears into the thick fog.",
  ["4070501_5"]="The Taiye Pool was once the imperial hot spring, staying around forty degrees year-round—Xin! Come back!",
  ["4070501_6"]="However, Xin has already dashed into the mist. Moments later, a sharp yelp rings out.",
  ["4070501_7"]="AAAH!",
  ["4070501_8"]="Ming Xiaomin, you liar! That's way hotter than forty degrees! My skin is about to melt off!",
  ["4070501_9"]="Xin reappears, clutching her right hand, the skin flushed bright red. Holding it out to Azi, she turns to Ming with a scowl.",
  ["4070502_1"]="The imperial walls of the Imperial Palace stand ten meters tall and are wide enough for two horses to ride side by side.",
  ["4070502_10"]="So many have carved things like \"I was here\" into the bricks. Azi, take a look! Almost every brick has one!",
  ["4070502_11"]="Oh... You weren't paying any attention when Qing explained this in class, I guess?",
  ["4070502_12"]="You're not wrong in your gut feeling. These are indeed carved words... but can you make out what they say?",
  ["4070502_13"]="Huh? What? Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?!",
  ["4070502_14"]="Frowning, Xin moves closer to get a better look.",
  ["4070502_15"]="This is... hmm... Ugh... Why are the characters all wobbly, like tadpoles? This is so hard to read...",
  ["4070502_16"]="This is seal script—an ancient form of Xia's writing. It reads, \"Chengdan Rong and Chong Ke.\"",
  ["4070502_17"]="Hmm? You can read ancient Qian script, Miss Zero?",
  ["4070502_18"]="I came across this type of script while studying old texts in the Library.",
  ["4070502_19"]="It means that this brick was made by two workers: a Chengdan named Rong, and a Chong named Ke.",
  ["4070502_2"]="On one side of the city wall, thick fog envelops the area. Through the mist, faint outlines of the imperial garden's furnishings can be seen.",
  ["4070502_20"]="That's right. In ancient Qian's language, \"Chengdan\" refers to men sentenced to forced labor, while \"Chong\" refers to women in the same situation.",
  ["4070502_21"]="During the era of Ji Xia, every brick used in construction bore the names of the workers who crafted it. If a brick wasn't up to standard, the workers would be punished.",
  ["4070502_22"]="That's brutal.",
  ["4070502_23"]="To build a wall this massive, they must have forced tens of thousands of people into labor…",
  ["4070502_24"]="Hmm... There's a plaque here. It must have been embedded into the wall during construction. It records the project's timeline.",
  ["4070502_25"]="\"Year 25 of Xia. Wall length: 150 paces. Duration: 9 months. Laborers conscripted: 723. Executions due to substandard work: 159. Verified and completed. Overseers: Prime Minister Ji Xian, Guardian of Tianque Ji Xuan, and Deputy Supervisor Ji Huai.\"",
  ["4070502_26"]="In simpler terms, this section of the wall stretches 150 paces and was built in nine months. 723 laborers were conscripted, and 159 were executed for producing substandard bricks. The project was overseen by Prime Minister Ji Xian, Guardian of Tianque Ji Xuan, and Deputy Supervisor Ji Huai.",
  ["4070502_27"]="Sounds horrifying.",
  ["4070502_28"]="All the overseers were from the Ji clan?",
  ["4070502_29"]="Looks like the Ji Xia era wasn't exactly a golden age for the common folk.",
  ["4070502_3"]="We're standing atop the most fortified section of the ancient imperial palace. It's said that this wall has never been breached from the outside. It has only ever fallen due to betrayal from within, each time leading to a new dynasty.",
  ["4070502_30"]="Some of these names seem familiar. Back at Kanjiang Pavilion, I remember seeing statues with these same names carved into their pedestals.",
  ["4070502_31"]="Prime Minister, Guardian of Tianque, and Deputy Supervisor... All those high-ranking officials have statues in Kanjiang Pavilion. Hmm... let's keep going.",
  ["4070502_4"]="These bricks are far from what they once were... Please don't touch them. They might crumble.",
  ["4070502_5"]="Over the years, the wall has been repaired, rebuilt, and reinforced countless times. The section beneath our feet is the oldest and the best-preserved part, directly inherited from the era of Ji Xia.",
  ["4070502_6"]="But that was all long ago.",
  ["4070502_7"]="Just as Ming has said, the bricks show visible signs of weathering, with bits of loose debris occasionally falling from the edges.",
  ["4070502_8"]="The stone surface is covered in fine, intricate lines, but upon closer inspection, they don't appear to be naturally formed.",
  ["4070502_9"]="The tourists here really lack manners.",
  ["4070503_1"]="\"Year 36 of Xia: heavy rains caused damage to the walls. Laborers conscripted: 2,000. Executions due to substandard work: 432. Overseers: Prime Minister Ji Xian, Guardian of Tianque Ji Xuan, and Supervisor Ji Huai.\"",
  ["4070503_2"]="From forced labor to conscripted civilians... imagine how many people had to be forced into labor and how many were executed, all just to repair these walls!",
  ["4070503_3"]="If some laborers' work wasn't good enough, they were put to death. Then, they'd just bring in a fresh batch of laborers.",
  ["4070503_4"]="And if too many were executed and they found themselves short on manpower, they'd just round up able-bodied civilians and force them into labor instead. The construction had to continue, no matter the cost, until the royal family was satisfied.",
  ["4070503_5"]="Just hearing this makes my blood boil. Where did that bastard run off to? Once we find him, I'll make him pay for every last crime of those brutes!",
  ["4070504_1"]="On the top of the ancient walls of QingYu's imperial palace.",
  ["4070504_10"]="He treated human lives like they were worthless, so selfish and ruthless! He got to live forever because of some anomaly, and he treated ordinary people as nothing more than pests...",
  ["4070504_11"]="And now they call Ji Xia the \"Father of Human Culture\"? From what I've seen, he's nothing but a complete douchebag!",
  ["4070504_12"]="He even made Qing doubt Nong Ji...",
  ["4070504_13"]="...",
  ["4070504_14"]="Perhaps when we reach Wencheng Pavilion, the records there will paint an entirely different picture of Ji Xia.",
  ["4070504_15"]="Different evidence, records, and perspectives can lead people to completely opposite conclusions about the same historical figure.",
  ["4070504_16"]="History is complicated.",
  ["4070504_17"]="Come on, Professor Ming, say something!",
  ["4070504_18"]="Zero, who has remained silent all this time, suddenly stops and points to a plaque on the wall.",
  ["4070504_19"]="Can you help me double-check the text on this one, Miss Ming?",
  ["4070504_2"]="Bricks inscribed with the names of the long dead stretch endlessly ahead, each tiny engraving marking someone who once lived and breathed.",
  ["4070504_20"]="Let's see... \"Year 55 of Xia. Earthquake damage to the walls. Laborers conscripted: 4,500. Executions due to substandard work: 109. Overseers: Prime Minister Ji Xian, Grand General Ji Hong, Minister of Works Ji Qi.\"",
  ["4070504_21"]="Huh? Ji Xian... wasn't that the name on the first plaque we saw when we climbed up here?",
  ["4070504_22"]="Something is off about the timeline.",
  ["4070504_23"]="They lived way too long.",
  ["4070504_24"]="This spans nearly thirty years. Even if they were high-ranking officials in their youth, they should have passed on their positions by now.",
  ["4070504_25"]="Ancient people didn't live nearly as long as we do today. Most barely made it to thirty, and lifespans in the Xia Dynasty were even shorter.",
  ["4070504_26"]="Yet these officials never got replaced. The same people held these positions for decades...",
  ["4070504_27"]="I seriously doubt a bunch of decrepit old men could still be cracking whips and running labor camps!",
  ["4070504_28"]="So, the statues we saw at Kanjiang Pavilion...",
  ["4070504_29"]="What if...",
  ["4070504_3"]="Every few steps, a taskmaster's plaque appears, the numbers constantly shifting as they rise and fall.",
  ["4070504_30"]="Now I get it. The statues in Kanjiang Pavilion were never engraved with a year of death. It's not to symbolize eternal life or keep their names alive forever...",
  ["4070504_31"]="Yeah, but because they are all immortals like Ji Xia.",
  ["4070504_34"]="They are still around today, so naturally, their death dates were not recorded.",
  ["4070504_35"]="My words make everyone's faces drop.",
  ["4070504_4"]="On the plaques, people who lived five thousand years ago have been reduced to mere cold, emotionless statistics.",
  ["4070504_5"]="The simple inscription of the word \"execution\" on the plaque symbolizes the erasure of hundreds of lives.",
  ["4070504_6"]="It is like walking on a path paved with bones.",
  ["4070504_7"]="\"Willows cling to somber green, As autumn's chill whispers unseen. Mountains, rivers, vast and bare, My homeland's anvil cries despair. Moonlit homes in quiet glow, Yet hearts are heavy, burdened low. The emperor's ambition, a costly plight, Leaves the collapsed wall to haunt the night.\"",
  ["4070504_8"]="I know this poem. It tells the story of a laborer who died while building the wall, his bones sealed inside. Grief-stricken, his wife wept so intensely that the wall eventually crumbled, exposing his remains.",
  ["4070504_9"]="Then he orchestrated all of this, trying to turn everyone in Qian into monsters just like him.",
  ["4070505_1"]="Hold on, did we miss a plaque back there? Maybe we should go back and check. It might contain more information.",
  ["4070701_1"]="Huh? The door's locked... Wait, Xin, put that spear down—Professor Ming, do something!",
  ["4070701_2"]="Hmm... I've never come across anything like this before. Let me see...",
  ["4070701_3"]="Let's take a closer look around.",
  ["4070701_4"]="The patterns on the walls appear to be connected to the instruments nearby.",
  ["4070701_5"]="Aren't instruments meant to be played? What if we try playing the ones that match the patterns on the wall? I've got a hunch this might just work!",
  ["4070702_1"]="The door stays firmly shut. There's no way through.",
  ["4070702_2"]="Again? Alright... so how do we play these instruments this time?",
  ["4070703_1"]="There are some sheets of paper on the table. The markings on them appear to be rubbings of the inscriptions from the bronze artifacts outside.",
  ["4070703_10"]="I can understand the meaning, but I don't know the historical context behind it.",
  ["4070703_11"]="The first part is just typical praise, extolling Ji Xia's achievements in founding the kingdom. Nothing remarkable there.",
  ["4070703_12"]="But the latter sections... Those would certainly pique the interest of historians.",
  ["4070703_13"]="These records suggest that the chime bells were made during the so-called \"Tianli Regency.\"",
  ["4070703_15"]="It does. The Tianli clan is an ancient lineage that has lasted through the ages. Legend has it that after Ji Xia established his capital, he spent years traveling, neglecting state affairs. During that time, Li Jun, the leader of the Tianli clan, known as the \"Lord of Weaponry,\" served as regent in his place.",
  ["4070703_16"]="Tianli? Regency? Does this have anything to do with those Tianli clan members we ran into before?",
  ["4070703_18"]="Wait a minute. If Ji Xia and Li Jun were so close back then, why does the Tianli clan now speak Ji Xia's name like it's something sour on their tongues?",
  ["4070703_2"]="Is this some kind of writing too?",
  ["4070703_5"]="At least the characters in textbooks are made up of straight lines. These, though, look more like a swarm of ants scrambling around!",
  ["4070703_6"]="It looks nothing like the ones in books!",
  ["4070703_7"]="This is an ancient script, so old that even people from centuries ago regarded it as ancient. Hmm... some of these characters are so obscure that even I can only decipher bits and pieces.",
  ["4070703_8"]="\"The Emperor rules over all the land, establishing laws and decrees, while his ministers diligently carry them out. When he first unified the realm under heaven, everyone, from the rivers to the seas, submitted without exception.\"",
  ["4070703_9"]="Hmm, seems like Miss Zero has a better grasp of ancient texts than I do.",
  ["4070704_1"]="The door stays firmly shut. There's no way through.",
  ["4070704_2"]="I remember seeing some patterns on the walls in the hallway earlier. Let's go check them out again.",
  ["4070705_3"]="Let's take a closer look at the walls. Some of these patterns might be the key.",
  ["4070706_2"]="Maybe we should go back and check the hallway walls again? There might be something we missed.",
  ["4071101_10"]="What? What are you guys talking about? Can't you just stop speaking in riddles?",
  ["4071101_11"]="Hmm... if you put it that way, I guess... right at the center of the palace?",
  ["4071101_12"]="I still don't get it... How do you even hide something inside this thing?",
  ["4071101_13"]="Still feels like a stretch. This thing's been out in the open for centuries. You're telling me no one ever thought to check inside?",
  ["4071101_14"]="Zongxia Bell? What, is it some kind of big deal?",
  ["4071101_19"]="I hate to admit it, but yeah... we're no closer than when we started.",
  ["4071101_20"]="But the very heart of the palace... isn't that Tianchi Lake? Are you saying the seal is at the bottom of the lake?",
  ["4071101_21"]="That actually makes a lot of sense. Come on, let's go check it out!",
  ["4071101_22"]="Maybe the answer has been right in front of us this whole time.",
  ["4071101_23"]="...",
  ["4071101_24"]="\"Establish the nation at the heart of the world and place the palace at the center of the nation. Only through perfect balance can moral order be achieved; only through benevolence comes sanctity.\"",
  ["4071101_25"]="The seal must be inside the bell.",
  ["4071101_26"]="The bell... the center...",
  ["4071101_27"]="Wait a moment...",
  ["4071101_28"]="Miss Zero, are you saying—?",
  ["4071101_29"]="Zero gives a slight nod.",
  ["4071101_3"]="Inside Wencheng Pavilion, in front of the black pillar.",
  ["4071101_30"]="Xin waves her hand impatiently.",
  ["4071101_31"]="I see... That makes sense.",
  ["4071101_32"]="The capital was built at the center of the world, with the imperial palace at its heart. So, where does that leave the emperor?",
  ["4071101_33"]="*sigh*",
  ["4071101_34"]="Perfect balance, justice, benevolence, sanctity. If we follow that logic, the jade seal, which represents imperial authority, should be placed at the very heart of the palace. That's the most logical conclusion.",
  ["4071101_35"]="Exactly.",
  ["4071101_36"]="No.",
  ["4071101_37"]="Think about it. During major ceremonies, the emperor needs to stand at the heart of the empire. They're not going to have him rowing a boat to the middle of a lake every time, right? So, the ancient architects made sure the palace's geometric center is just a little off from the lake.",
  ["4071101_38"]="It's the plaza right in front of the main hall.",
  ["4071101_39"]="If you check a map, the geometric center of the palace isn't even Tianchi Lake.",
  ["4071101_4"]="We stand in silence, our eyes locked on the inscriptions.",
  ["4071101_40"]="Now that I think about it... right in the center of that plaza, there's a bell tower. And inside, there's a huge bell.",
  ["4071101_41"]="Miss Zero, this could be the clue left for us.",
  ["4071101_42"]="In the Qian language, \"bell\" and \"center\" are pronounced the same.",
  ["4071101_43"]="If the bell's knob is hollow, then there's plenty of room to hide a jade seal inside.",
  ["4071101_44"]="No, I'm sure plenty of people did, but this isn't just any bell. It's the Zongxia Bell. Even if someone had figured it out back in the day, no one would have dared to break it open.",
  ["4071101_45"]="Let me guess, you totally zoned out when Qing was giving that history lesson.",
  ["4071101_47"]="And now, it's a cultural artifact. No one would even think about destroying it.",
  ["4071101_48"]="If someone had suggested smashing it open in front of the emperor back then... Well, you can imagine how that would've ended.",
  ["4071101_49"]="Ever since, the bell has been kept as a symbol of his rightful rule over the realm.",
  ["4071101_5"]="Xin is the first to break the silence.",
  ["4071101_50"]="Legend has it that when Ji Xia became the Emperor, he collected bronze from across the land and had Li Jun, the Lord of Weaponry, personally oversee the casting of a great bell. This bell symbolized the submission of all nations to his rule.",
  ["4071101_51"]="In front of the palace's main hall.",
  ["4071101_52"]="Just like Ming said, a massive bell tower stands at the center of the spacious plaza.",
  ["4071101_53"]="A massive bronze bell hangs inside the pavilion, its surface worn and weathered by the passage of time.",
  ["4071101_54"]="Be patient, Xin.",
  ["4071101_55"]="Jade Seal",
  ["4071101_6"]="Great. After all this running around, all we've found are more questions. And we still have no idea where that seal is!",
  ["4071101_7"]="Come on, I know that old geezer! He's known where the seal is this whole time! Why did he have us waste all this energy running around the imperial palace instead of just telling us?",
  ["4071101_8"]="Ugh, you already said that, Zero!",
  ["4071102_1"]="Xin scratches her head.",
  ["4071102_10"]="If this bell really dates back to Ji Xia's time, then it's definitely been broken before. I mean, someone had to crack it open if they wanted to hide the jade seal inside.",
  ["4071102_11"]="Xin strikes the bronze bell with full force, and a deafening echo fills the empty palace, lingering in the air.",
  ["4071102_12"]="Despite the force of the blow, the bell stays perfectly intact. As the sound slowly fades, a small, palm-sized object rolls out from inside the bell.",
  ["4071102_13"]="Wow, Professor Ming, I didn't know you had such a devious side!",
  ["4071102_2"]="So... what do we do?",
  ["4071102_3"]="If we can't break it, then how are we supposed to check if the seal's actually inside?",
  ["4071102_5"]="Huh?",
  ["4071102_7"]="Alright, alright, since you said so, I'm on it!",
  ["4071102_8"]="Let's do this.",
  ["4071102_9"]="I said, let's do this. Once we're done, we'll collect the pieces. With WeiShi's technology, we can put the bell back together like nothing ever happened.",
  ["4071103_2"]="Xin catches it.",
  ["4071103_3"]="She turns the jade seal over, studying it for a moment before awkwardly handing it to Ming.",
  ["4071103_4"]="The underside of the jade seal is engraved with unfamiliar characters. Even at a glance, it's clear they predate the script found in the ancient texts of Wencheng Pavilion.",
  ["4071103_5"]="Is this it? Let me see...",
  ["4071103_6"]="I'll leave it to you, Professor.",
  ["4071103_7"]="Let's get this back to Master Yuanquan immediately.",
  ["4071103_8"]="Yes, this has to be it.",
  ["4071103_9"]="\"Heart of the World.\"",
  ["4071104_2"]="I've been expecting you, Head Librarian. Master Yuanquan asked me to wait here for you.",
  ["4071104_3"]="Please, step aboard. I'll take you right back.",
  ["4071104_4"]="See? Told you! He knew exactly where this thing was the whole time. He even had someone waiting for us at the end!",
  ["4071105_1"]="Looks like you've found what you were after.",
  ["4071105_10"]="Memories flood my mind: the Tianli ancestral home, the Kanjiang Pavilion, the towering city walls, and Wencheng Pavilion. Every moment I experienced there comes rushing back.",
  ["4071105_11"]="To the Tianli, he was a traitor who broke his promises. To the scholars of Kanjiang Pavilion, he was a wise ruler who built an empire and saved his people. To others, he was a tyrant who drained the land with endless construction and crippling taxes. And now, in the present, he is the mastermind pulling the strings, determined to drag all of Qian into his so-called eternal paradise...",
  ["4071105_12"]="I'm not sure.",
  ["4071105_13"]="Yuanquan smiles, as if he has expected that answer.",
  ["4071105_14"]="Before I can say another word, the ground trembles and thick fog begins to rise once again.",
  ["4071105_15"]="The words has barely left his lips before hordes of beasts, twisted and corrupted by the Cerulean Water, charge forward in a frenzied attack.",
  ["4071105_16"]="Looks like someone else who needs to answer that is on their way.",
  ["4071105_2"]="Looks like you've learned a lot on your journey.",
  ["4071105_3"]="All that you went through to find it, that's its true purpose.",
  ["4071105_4"]="Now that you've come all this way, tell me what you think the First Emperor... no, Ji Xia, is really like.",
  ["4071105_5"]="Before I answer your questions, mind if I ask you one?",
  ["4071105_6"]="And you've got what you wanted too, it seems.",
  ["4071105_7"]="What exactly is this jade seal for?",
  ["4071105_8"]="I hold out the jade seal with both hands, but Yuanquan doesn't reach for it.",
  ["4071105_9"]="I hold out the jade seal with both hands, but Yuanquan doesn't reach for it.",
  ["4071301_1"]="Holy cow! Finally found you, Chi!",
  ["4071301_3"]="Our youngsters are holding back those warriors on our tail! Come on, Patriarch! They need backup!",
  ["4071301_4"]="By the ancestors' beards! A bunch of terracotta soldiers just rose from the mountain!",
  ["4071301_5"]="What's happening?! Didn't I tell you to evacuate?",
  ["4071301_6"]="...Sorry, but I've got to go. Just follow my lead.",
  ["4071301_7"]="Wait—WHAT?! Seriously?!",
  ["4071301_8"]="Wait... Hey! Why the rush? We're not about to twiddle our thumbs here!",
  ["4071302_1"]="The earthquake caused a landslide, and these bronze soldiers just... crawled out of the rear mountain.",
  ["4071302_2"]="Chi went in alone. Please, help him.",
  ["4071302_3"]="We barely trapped them in our ancestral home. Thank the heavens, Chi got back in time to finish them off.",
  ["4071303_2"]="Are these bronze things even human? Or some messed-up movie props? Just look at their green blood!",
  ["4071303_3"]="Oh, come on! Is this a hidden-camera prank or something? Where's the crew?!",
  ["4071304_1"]="As the final bronze warrior falls to Li Chi's blade, his breath quickens, his previous composure slipping away.",
  ["4071304_10"]="Azi inspects the shards from the bronze soldiers.",
  ["4071304_11"]="But these things... even their flesh and blood are metal.",
  ["4071304_12"]="The beasts we fought earlier only had bronze skin and bones, but...",
  ["4071304_13"]="These garments are ancient soldier uniforms, from at least a thousand years back.",
  ["4071304_14"]="Are we seriously fighting ancient zombies right now?",
  ["4071304_15"]="If we're going there now, that isn't trespassing, right?",
  ["4071304_2"]="Something's wrong. These... things... they're not human. Not anymore.",
  ["4071304_4"]="These beasts crawled out from the rear mountain... my clan's sacred lands.",
  ["4071304_5"]="As I survey the surroundings, some of these bronze figures do not collapse to the ground but shatter from within.",
  ["4071304_6"]="These beings have long had their cores turned to bronze, stripped of flesh and blood—mere statues devoid of life.",
  ["4071304_7"]="Ming leans over, meticulously examining the attire of these soldiers.",
  ["4071304_8"]="Though weathered, their attire still bears distinct markings of their ancient origins.",
  ["4071304_9"]="She lifts her head, a tinge of gravity in her gaze.",
  ["4071305_2"]="The earthquakes are getting worse. Let's just hurry to the ancestral home... I really don't want overtime today... *mutter*",
  ["4071305_3"]="Heehee, please lead the way, dear Patriarch.",
  ["4071305_4"]="...Follow me.",
  ["4071502_1"]="Is this big guy dead... or just napping?",
  ["4071502_2"]="Judging by his outfit, he looks like a general.",
  ["4071502_3"]="If I recall correctly, Ji Hong was once Ji Xia's right-hand man. During Li Jun's reign, he rebelled against Li Jun and captured him...",
  ["4071502_4"]="Oh, right! Remember the stone tablet? \"Year 55 of Xia. Earthquake damage to the walls. Laborers conscripted: 4,500. Executions due to substandard work: 109. Overseers: Prime Minister Ji Xian, Grand General Ji Hong, Minister of Works Ji Qi.\"",
  ["4071502_5"]="Ji Hong.",
  ["4071502_6"]="So, this guy is Grand General Ji Hong?",
  ["4071502_7"]="Shhh, let's not disturb them. Who knows if they're out cold or just napping?",
  ["4071502_8"]="...Heh, just another immortality-obsessed coward.",
  ["4071502_9"]="...",
  ["4071503_1"]="Argh! It's stuck tight. And no levers or buttons to open it.",
  ["4071503_2"]="Hey, dear Patriarch? Can you work your magic once more?",
  ["4071503_3"]="Ah, never around when we need you.",
  ["4071503_4"]="Breaking it down? Think again. It'd take ages, and definitely not quietly.",
  ["4071503_5"]="This gate's solid, at least a foot thick.",
  ["4071503_6"]="...",
  ["4071503_7"]="...",
  ["4071504_2"]="The fog is thick here... Hold your breath and be careful!",
  ["4071504_3"]="I heard something above us...",
  ["4071504_4"]="Shh, keep low.",
  ["4071801_10"]="His words leave us frozen in place.",
  ["4071801_11"]="Li Chi nods.",
  ["4071801_12"]="Ming gazes intently at the colossal \"fish scales\" before her.",
  ["4071801_13"]="Huh? Could it be those imprisoned here were so starving so they carved...",
  ["4071801_14"]="Then why carve huge fish scales? And made them so... delic... delicious?",
  ["4071801_15"]="What about those crystals?",
  ["4071801_16"]="It's \"delicate.\" Still, were they really carved?",
  ["4071801_17"]="Technically possible. Are you suggesting...?",
  ["4071801_18"]="Hey, hey! Stop being a scaremonger!",
  ["4071801_20"]="Its formation dates back to the Mesozoic era or beyond.",
  ["4071801_21"]="Since around 80 to 120 million years ago, or perhaps even earlier.",
  ["4071801_22"]="...",
  ["4071801_23"]="Logically, this is quite possible.",
  ["4071801_25"]="What if there are Mesozoic creatures influenced by Cerulean Water still alive today?",
  ["4071801_26"]="Let's think about Li Chi's words... What if some creatures survived all those volcanic eruptions?",
  ["4071801_27"]="Maybe it's premature to jump to that conclusion.",
  ["4071801_28"]="What was that you said, Azi? \"There're no bronze monsters anywhere,\" right?",
  ["4071801_29"]="I'd call it \"reasonable speculation.\"",
  ["4071801_3"]="What are these... things? They look like giant fish scales. Are they carved?",
  ["4071801_30"]="Anyway, we should be careful.",
  ["4071801_31"]="Hmm... when I heard you talking about geology, time, and stuff, it made me think of the Cerulean Crystals we used for crafting weapons...",
  ["4071801_32"]="Of course it has! Didn't we already know that it was activated in Ji Xia's time?",
  ["4071801_34"]="I mean, the thing that brings the Cerulean Water... What's it called again, a Beacon? Has it ever been activated before?",
  ["4071801_35"]="I'm not an expert on your fancy theories, but from what I've heard, the Beacon and Anomalies don't have much to do with humans, right?",
  ["4071801_36"]="No, I mean earlier.",
  ["4071801_37"]="Then could the Dragon Pillar have activated before humans even existed?",
  ["4071801_38"]="If some prehistoric creatures drank the Cerulean Water and became bronze monsters...",
  ["4071801_39"]="Didn't you mention volcanic activity? How long has Mount Tianque been active?",
  ["4071801_4"]="Starving! They're bronze monsters with eternal life. They don't need food anymore.",
  ["4071801_40"]="Perhaps the Cerulean Crystals our ancestors discovered in Heavenly Lake are actually... remnants of those ancient beings.",
  ["4071801_41"]="If that's the case, its eruptions would likely have wiped out those bronze creatures.",
  ["4071801_42"]="That's one way to look at it. We haven't figured out the triggers for activating Beacons or Anomalies yet.",
  ["4071801_5"]="What's wrong?",
  ["4071801_6"]="I... I've never thought about that.",
  ["4071801_7"]="That just doesn't add up, because if they did, they'd be immortal and still around today! But there're no bronze monsters anywhere!",
  ["4071801_8"]="Li Chi's face turns pensive.",
  ["4072201_1"]="The temperature is raising.",
  ["4072201_10"]="Though none in the land of Qian has witnessed it with their own eyes, its image has long been etched into the hearts of every citizen.",
  ["4072201_11"]="The Loong.",
  ["4072201_12"]="Its body has practically merged with the mountain itself…",
  ["4072201_13"]="So, is this what caused all those recent earthquakes on Mount Tianque?",
  ["4072201_14"]="Is it dead?",
  ["4072201_15"]="None will overlook the \"massive sword\" plunging into the Loong's body.",
  ["4072201_16"]="Its enormity suggests that only the colossal statues guarding the imperial tombs could wield it.",
  ["4072201_17"]="No...",
  ["4072201_18"]="It can't be that simple.",
  ["4072201_19"]="Notice anything?",
  ["4072201_2"]="This place must be near the lava chamber.",
  ["4072201_20"]="For some time now, our attention has been focused on the giant sword.",
  ["4072201_21"]="Yet, for some inexplicable reason, my focus subtly shifts, akin to noticing a star of a slightly different hue amidst a field of starlight.",
  ["4072201_22"]="Subconsciously, I raise my hand, gesturing towards the Loong's head.",
  ["4072201_23"]="Look, there's another sword there.",
  ["4072201_25"]="Huh?! Is that... a Cerulean Crystal sword?",
  ["4072201_26"]="Nestled within the Loong's head, a tiny, cerulean sword emits a faint glow, appearing as delicate as a needle compared to the bulk of the Loong.",
  ["4072201_27"]="A barely perceptible trickle of cerulean blood trickles from the wound inflicted by the sword.",
  ["4072201_28"]="Who drove that sword into the Loong's head?",
  ["4072201_29"]="The answer seems clear.",
  ["4072201_3"]="However, I can't help but slow down and lighten my steps, so as not to disturb something that remains dormant for eons.",
  ["4072201_30"]="Ji Xia.",
  ["4072201_31"]="Was he trying to...",
  ["4072201_32"]="Before I can finish my words, a tremor ripples beneath my feet.",
  ["4072201_33"]="It feels as if something is emitting labored breaths due to pain.",
  ["4072201_34"]="Not far away, the cerulean eyes slowly open.",
  ["4072201_4"]="But as I finally witnessed the \"Thing\", it surpassed far beyond my expectations.",
  ["4072201_5"]="Below the yellow spring, the Imperial Tombs stand prominently, with scattered fire lights reflecting off the numerous minerals exposed on the mountain wall, resembling a starry sky deep underground.",
  ["4072201_6"]="The underground palace exudes grandeur, with an architectural structure similar to that of the imperial palace in QingYu City above.",
  ["4072201_7"]="Earth reflected in heaven, death celebrated as life. So, this is Ji Xia's grand plan... to rebuild a whole imperial palace in a place like this.",
  ["4072201_8"]="But what is that...?",
  ["4072201_9"]="Positioned at the center, right below where Tianchi Lake is on the surface, lies a plaza, within which the behemoth slumbers.",
  ["4072501_1"]="Any injuries?",
  ["4072501_2"]="All good. The elders and children are safe upstairs... but a few feral beasts in the front yard are causing us trouble.",
  ["4072501_3"]="No injuries, that's good. I'll handle the rest.",
  ["4072601_1"]="Some decorations, toys... maybe grab a few snacks too — that should do it.",
  ["4072601_10"]="Perhaps it's best not to tell him the source of these \"handicrafts\"...",
  ["4072601_11"]="Are you shopping for gifts?",
  ["4072601_12"]="What did you pick up, Li Chi?",
  ["4072601_3"]="Oh, it's you.",
  ["4072601_4"]="Just some gifts for my clan folks.",
  ["4072601_5"]="These handicrafts look fantastic and go well with our outfits... Take a look.",
  ["4072601_6"]="Li Chi hands me two pieces of jewelry that strangely seem familiar.",
  ["4072601_7"]="Upon a closer look, it turns out that they are the \"traditional Tianli handicrafts\" sold by Tianli livestreamers, unknown to Li Chi...",
  ["4072601_8"]="I need twenty of these.",
  ["4072601_9"]="Thank you for your patronage, generous customer!",
  ["4072602_1"]="As I worried, it's a bit rushed...",
  ["4072602_10"]="As they say, simplicity can shine brighter than extravagance. Plain lanterns can create a sense of festivity in a subtle and classy manner amidst the hustle and bustle.",
  ["4072602_11"]="Take a closer look. There's a unique charm to them...",
  ["4072602_12"]="Weren't you talking about taking a breather?",
  ["4072602_13"]="What are you doing here?",
  ["4072602_14"]="What's so special about these lanterns?",
  ["4072602_16"]="But most of the lanterns on the streets seem pretty simple, don't they?",
  ["4072602_18"]="Something seems off...",
  ["4072602_19"]="Isn't it because of a lack of funds?",
  ["4072602_2"]="Hmm? Have you finished up at the Festival yet?",
  ["4072602_20"]="Oh, is that so?",
  ["4072602_21"]="Well, as we say around here, \"The wise maintain a thoughtful silence while seeing clearly.\"",
  ["4072602_4"]="I was actually thinking of finding a spot to relax, but these lanterns suddenly caught my attention.",
  ["4072602_6"]="You know, here in Qian, we have all kinds of lantern-making techniques.",
  ["4072602_7"]="Our lanterns come in various shapes, some with intricate designs.",
  ["4072602_9"]="Ahem, you're missing the point, Head Librarian.",
  ["4072603_1"]="Even though Qing suggested improving security measures, with such a large festival area, where do we even begin our investigation?",
  ["4072603_10"]="They've caught on to our little game, Azi. Let's spill the beans.",
  ["4072603_11"]="Well... I'm sorry, Head Librarian. Actually, Xin and I are on patrol.",
  ["4072603_12"]="Secretary Qing told us to keep a close eye during the Harvest Festival due to the large crowds. So, we're watching out for any suspicious activity.",
  ["4072603_13"]="But we haven't spotted anything unusual so far.",
  ["4072603_15"]="Yeah, you two enjoy yourselves.",
  ["4072603_16"]="Hey, there.",
  ["4072603_17"]="What's this \"investigation\" all about?",
  ["4072603_18"]="What's going on here?",
  ["4072603_19"]="Did something go wrong?",
  ["4072603_2"]="If they're planning something big, they'll need a way to bring in their resources. Let's start with looking into the logistics.",
  ["4072603_20"]="Really?",
  ["4072603_21"]="What's the name of that place?",
  ["4072603_22"]="Since you're both on duty...",
  ["4072603_23"]="I won't keep you any longer.",
  ["4072603_4"]="Gwaah! Hold on... where did you two pop up from? You startled me!",
  ["4072603_6"]="Oh! N-nothing! We... we were just talking about checking out new shops!",
  ["4072603_7"]="I went to a hotpot place earlier, and it was packed. When Xin asked why, I mentioned it must be because of their fresh ingredients, thanks to their efficient logistics...",
  ["4072603_9"]="Um... it's called... you know...",
  ["4072604_1"]="Phew... that's the last delivery.",
  ["4072604_10"]="Have a great time at the Festival!",
  ["4072604_11"]="Hey there, Mr. Driver!",
  ["4072604_12"]="Happy Harvest Festival!",
  ["4072604_13"]="That was quick!",
  ["4072604_3"]="Hey there! Happy Harvest Festival!",
  ["4072604_4"]="You're here for our captain, right? Well, you're a tad late; he's already headed back to the Northern Region.",
  ["4072604_6"]="Yeah, he might seem tough, but he's quite a family man. Once he finished up here, he rushed back home to be with his loved ones.",
  ["4072604_7"]="Before he left, he made sure to give you his contact information, inviting you to visit the Northern Region whenever you have free time. He's going to be your host.",
  ["4072604_8"]="Thankfully you showed up; otherwise, I'd struggle to explain to him.",
  ["4072604_9"]="The Harvest Festival is going smoothly, and we've completed our tasks perfectly. I think it's time for me to head back too.",
  ["4072605_1"]="Happy Harvest Festival! Help yourselves to some candies and have fun!",
  ["4072605_10"]="What's the candy for?",
  ["4072605_11"]="What's your family name?",
  ["4072605_12"]="What's your sister's family name?",
  ["4072605_13"]="Oh, it's nothing.",
  ["4072605_14"]="Thanks for the candy.",
  ["4072605_2"]="As I walk along the street, a girl stuffs a handful of candies into my hand.",
  ["4072605_3"]="Is handing out candies also a tradition at the Harvest Festival?",
  ["4072605_5"]="It's for a baby's birthday. My sister had a safe delivery recently, so I wanted to spread some joy in the neighborhood.",
  ["4072605_6"]="As I hold the weighty candies, a memory resurfaces of encountering a pregnant woman in CangLin City.",
  ["4072605_8"]="It's Jiang... why?",
  ["4072605_9"]="Thank you.",
  ["4072606_1"]="...Let's switch off the lights while no one else is around.",
  ["4072606_11"]="I was thinking of going back, but then the Harvest Festival started, and I wanted to inspect the water pipeline here too, so I decided to stay a few more days.",
  ["4072606_12"]="Good thing I stayed. Looks like some pipes need fixing due to the recent animal attacks.",
  ["4072606_14"]="Then I'm counting on you guys.",
  ["4072606_15"]="What's that shady guy doing over there?",
  ["4072606_17"]="Save your explanations for the Bureau of Civil Security.",
  ["4072606_18"]="Caught you red-handed, vandal!",
  ["4072606_19"]="And you are...?",
  ["4072606_20"]="You're the engineer who installed the water pipes.",
  ["4072606_21"]="Weren't you planning to head back to Fengbei?",
  ["4072606_23"]="We're here to help.",
  ["4072606_24"]="Consider this our way of saying sorry.",
  ["4072606_3"]="Looks like he's tampering with the water pipes... I'll go and stop him.",
  ["4072606_4"]="Darn, this pipe is stuck tight... Hey, what are you doing? Stop! You're going to burst the pipe!",
  ["4072606_6"]="Hold on a second, have you misunderstood something here? I'm the engineer responsible for maintaining the water pipes in this area. Here's my work permit.",
  ["4072606_8"]="And you are... Oh, I remember you now. You helped me out during the pipeline installation.",
  ["4072606_9"]="Such a small world, bumping into you at the Festival.",
  ["4072607_1"]="Oh no, why does this have to break down right now...?",
  ["4072607_10"]="You look like you're in a bit of a pickle.",
  ["4072607_11"]="Let me give you a hand.",
  ["4072607_2"]="If only we had more hands here...",
  ["4072607_4"]="Oh, it's you, Head Librarian.",
  ["4072607_5"]="To be honest, we're facing some issues here...",
  ["4072607_6"]="While we've managed to get rid of most of the pollution, there are still traces left. Some goods got contaminated during transportation.",
  ["4072607_7"]="Look at these pots and bowls; they're stained with Cerulean Crystals. The shop owner thought it was some kind of bronze decorative pattern!",
  ["4072607_8"]="These items are mainly used for the kitchen. If we don't address the stained kitchenware... it could cause some serious problems.",
  ["4072607_9"]="Do you need a hand?",
  ["4072608_1"]="Boom—!!!",
  ["4072608_10"]="Are those fireworks?",
  ["4072608_11"]="Let's go together.",
  ["4072608_2"]="A loud noise erupts nearby, instantly capturing the attention of the bustling crowd.",
  ["4072608_4"]="No, that sounds more like... a sudden screeching of brakes. Could it be a car accident?",
  ["4072608_5"]="Wait a minute! Isn't this street already closed to traffic?!",
  ["4072608_6"]="Let's go check it out!",
  ["4072608_7"]="Hold on a second! We need to evacuate the crowd during situations like this!",
  ["4072608_8"]="The situation is urgent. You and Xin go over there, and I'll take care of things at the Festival.",
  ["4072608_9"]="What was that noise?",
  ["4072609_1"]="Phew, that was a close call.",
  ["4072609_2"]="Thanks for your help. I'll take care of the rest.",
  ["4072610_1"]="Great, we've sorted out that loose end...",
  ["4072610_2"]="You know what?... This plate looks amazing after a good wipe-down. I'll get a set for you as a token of gratitude!",
  ["4072611_2"]="The streets are bustling and everyone's in high spirits.",
  ["4072611_3"]="Just being here fills you with that contagious joy, making you unconsciously... smile.",
  ["4072611_5"]="Understood.",
  ["4072611_6"]="How do you like the Harvest Festival?",
  ["4072611_8"]="It's still early. Want to take a stroll around for a bit?",
  ["4073001_1"]="Excuse me, have you seen a young woman around here?",
  ["4073001_2"]="A young woman? There's a lot of commotion on the streets right now. I've seen quite a few young women!",
  ["4073001_3"]="Not just any young woman. She's in hospital clothes, with short hair, sitting in a wheelchair, and... accompanied by some suspicious-looking individuals.",
  ["4073001_4"]="Ah, now that you mention it, I believe I've seen them.",
  ["4073001_5"]="Eerily, the resident's body jerks before slowly raising his arm, pointing to the street corner.",
  ["4073001_6"]="The person you're searching for... Yeah, she's in that direction.",
  ["4073002_1"]="Finally, no more pesky puppets!",
  ["4073002_2"]="Now, it's time to confront the shady guy who showed me the way!",
  ["4073002_3"]="Just as Xin is about to dart away, a cry for help echoes from across the street.",
  ["4073003_1"]="Here we are.",
  ["4073003_2"]="Please be careful, Head Librarian.",
  ["4073003_3"]="The flow of strings from your direction... feels a bit chaotic.",
  ["4073003_5"]="Ten minutes ago.",
  ["4073004_1"]="These clean cuts are definitely Wushi's work.",
  ["4073004_10"]="Looks like we share the same target.",
  ["4073004_11"]="Tiaohua might be close by.",
  ["4073004_12"]="Let's give it a shot.",
  ["4073004_13"]="It's too risky.",
  ["4073004_2"]="The fight was swift. He left soon after dealing with the puppets.",
  ["4073004_3"]="It seems like he was searching for something or someone.",
  ["4073004_5"]="Do you need me to track him down?",
  ["4073004_7"]="Before I can finish my words, a sudden commotion seizes our attention.",
  ["4073004_8"]="Found anything?",
  ["4073005_1"]="Excellent, this must be the spot the large puppet indicated.",
  ["4073005_2"]="Someone's there. Perhaps I can gather some information from him.",
  ["4073006_1"]="I sensed fluctuations in the strings from your direction... Did you run into anything unusual?",
  ["4073006_2"]="Yeah, those dummies seemed to know I was coming and set up an ambush.",
  ["4073006_3"]="No worries, though. I turned them into firewood.",
  ["4073006_4"]="This is strange. Logically, Hongxian shouldn't have picked up on our movements so quickly, unless...",
  ["4073006_5"]="Hold on, the strings on your end are trembling again... Puppets are closing in!",
  ["4073006_6"]="Hah, perfect timing! The earlier dummies didn't give me much of a warm-up.",
  ["4073007_1"]="...",
  ["4073007_2"]="Looks like someone is ahead of us.",
  ["4073007_4"]="Zero instinctively grips the weapon in her hands.",
  ["4073007_5"]="Please stay close to me from now on, Seer.",
  ["4073007_6"]="These daggers...",
  ["4073007_7"]="It's Wushi.",
  ["5000101_1"]="We're almost there.",
  ["5000102_1"]="You stay here for now. Others will be arriving soon.",
  ["5000102_2"]="A towering black monolith looms into view, piercing through the heart of the tower and drawing the eye skyward, beyond the reach of sight.",
  ["5000102_3"]="The monolith is impossibly smooth yet utterly devoid of light, like a mirror forged from the night itself—melding brilliance and darkness into one.",
  ["5000102_4"]="Unfamiliar glyphs are etched across its surface, radiating an ineffable aura of mystery.",
  ["5000102_5"]="As I stare into it, a strange sensation takes hold—an eerie certainty that it is staring back, like an eye submerged in the abyss.",
  ["5000103_1"]="Why are you bringing an outsider here, Zero?",
  ["5000104_1"]="[BBNAME] can sense the existence of this tower.",
  ["5000104_2"]="That doesn't automatically make your guest one of us.",
  ["5000104_3"]="There's no point in arguing now. Let's gather [BBNAME]'s bio-information and check it against the population database.",

  ["5050501_1"]="So, these animals are getting restless? Let me knock some sense into them!",
  ["5050502_1"]="It's strange. Why would they want to destroy the pipes when the water inside is not even from the Grandeur River?",
  ["5050503_1"]="We're here to help repair the pipes. I'll leave those feral animals to you.",
  ["5050504_1"]="All the pipes are repaired. We're good to go now.",
  ["5050505_1"]="Please, help us! We're heading into the city, but what's wrong with those crazy animals?!",
  ["5050505_2"]="Ah! Don't let them touch the wagon! It's got all our precious drinking water!",
  ["5050801_1"]="Who's there?!",
  ["5050802_1"]="You look very prepared. Are you the one behind those animal attacks?!",

  ["5051101_1"]="Can you hear me, Xin? What's the situation on your end?",
  ["5051101_2"]="Everything's fine. I can't see anything unusual.",
  ["5051101_3"]="You got my coordinates, right? Help me with the barricades along my patrol route.",
  ["5051102_1"]="Qing, raise the barricades in my area!",
  ["5051103_1"]="Hmm? Is that...?",
  ["5051103_2"]="Attention, everyone! The target is on the move from Sector 6 towards Sector 5, along Line Y25!",
  ["5051104_1"]="The camera in Sector 6 picked up some movement!",

  ["5051301_1"]="That roar... it's the same bear that attacked us earlier.",
  ["5051302_1"]="It's heading towards the city.",
  ["5051401_1"]="The bear has broken into the city.",
  ["5051401_2"]="Copy that. We've evacuated all citizens from the streets!",
  ["5051401_3"]="Please stop it from causing any more damage in the city.",
  ["5060201_1"]="Oh, you think you're the bosses here now? Get down!",
  ["5060202_1"]="This mountain, a beacon of grandeur and righteousness. Towers high, a testament to nature's glorious finesse. The ancient scholars really had a way with words.",
  ["5060203_1"]="That Cerulean Vapor is back... It's so dense this time, you can almost see it hanging in the air.",
  ["5060203_2"]="If I stumble into it accidentally, I might breathe in a lungful of that mist and end up with my brain rusted.",
  ["5060205_1"]="It's working! Let's use this opportunity to move out!",
  ["5060205_2"]="The Mist-clearing Lamp won't last long, and it can only purify a limited amount of vapor. We need to use it wisely.",
  ["5060206_1"]="Oh, isn't this the path leading to the royal palace?",
  ["5060206_2"]="I wonder how things are going on Master Yuanquan's side.",
  ["5060206_3"]="But for now, I need to head down the mountain to welcome some esteemed guests.",
  ["5060207_1"]="This waterfall is truly stunning... Oh, now is not the time to get lost in its beauty.",
  ["5060207_2"]="If this dam wasn't so run-down, the Cerulean Plague wouldn't have spread this far...",
  ["5060207_3"]="Have the other members sealed the gap yet? It's starting to really worry me.",
  ["5060208_1"]="The mist up ahead doesn't look too thick. I'll hold my breath and dash through in one go.",
  ["5060209_1"]="Oh no, my body is getting heavy. Let's steer clear of these mists.",
  ["5060301_1"]="Wasn't this street supposed to be closed off? Why does it seem like there's still activity on the second floor?",
  ["5060302_1"]="Hmm? Some members are gathering up ahead. Let's go ask what's going on.",
  ["5060303_1"]="See? This is exactly what could go wrong.",
  ["5060303_2"]="I'll handle things here. You guys head back into the room.",
  ["5060501_1"]="Hold on, is that a citizen who hasn't been evacuated yet?",
  ["5060501_2"]="Tsk! I knew they wouldn't just heed my words and go back! Xin, lend me a hand!",
  ["5060501_3"]="Seems like things haven't been running too smoothly for you in QingYu City, huh?",
  ["5060501_4"]="You! We'll talk about that later!",
  ["5060502_1"]="Boo-hoo... where's dad?",
  ["5060502_2"]="Huh? That sound is coming from the alley. Let's head in that direction.",
  ["5060503_1"]="Too many crystal clusters this way. We need to find another route.",
  ["5060503_2"]="Let's head down and take a detour.",
  ["5060505_1"]="The Mist-clearing Lamp has some serious suction power and could be incredibly useful in various situations.",
  ["5060506_1"]="Anyone out there? I'm stuck in here.",
  ["5060506_2"]="Please, help me open this door!",
  ["5060601_1"]="By the way, is your walkway sturdy enough?",
  ["5060601_2"]="Absolutely, it's rock solid. Crafted by our clan, tested for durability and safety, capable of bearing tons...",
  ["5060601_3"]="Gosh, I just hope we won't end up victims of your traditional craftsmanship.",
  ["5060602_1"]="Wait, the ground is shaking. Take my hand, Seer.",
  ["5060602_2"]="Debris falling! Watch out!",
  ["5060602_3"]="Trust me! This is not how it usually goes!",
  ["5060603_1"]="Phew! Those pesky monkeys must be playing around!",
  ["5060604_1"]="That boulder is too huge. Move back, I can't stop it.",
  ["5060605_1"]="We're almost there! Our ancestral mansion is just up ahead!",
  ["5060606_1"]="When will these things ever end? Are you opening a monkey zoo here or something?!",
  ["5060606_2"]="Enough with the sarcasm! Just throw your weapons!",
  ["5060606_3"]="Who's being sarcastic now? I'm running low on ammo!",
  ["5060607_1"]="I know it's urgent, but let's not panic!",
  ["5060607_2"]="Help me! Patriarch! Help me out!",
  ["5060607_3"]="If I don't make it, Patriarch, please save my kid! Save the future of our clan! And save the future of Qian!",
  ["5060608_1"]="Phew, that was close! We'd be toast if that hit us!",
  ["5060609_1"]="That's right. I can't say much about his other talents, but when it comes to fighting, he's second to none.",
  ["5060609_2"]="The Patriarch of the Tianli Clan?",
  ["5060609_3"]="Our Patriarch is here.",
  ["5060609_4"]="You can all rest easy now.",
  ["5060609_5"]="Phew... What a relief.",
  ["5060801_1"]="I think we can stop now. I'm starving! My stomach's rumbling!",
  ["5060801_2"]="Sure, let's head back and grab something to eat!",
  ["5060802_1"]="Hold on, I'm not finished yet! Let's keep exploring for more content for my vlogs!",
  ["5060803_1"]="This mansion sits halfway up the mountain. Is it also drawing water from Tianchi Lake? Maybe I should ask someone about it?",
  ["5060804_1"]="This mansion looks ancient. Maybe we can chat with some elders to learn about its history.",
  ["5060805_1"]="Hmm, the back of the mountain isn't in this direction... Oh, that guy over there seems like a guard. Let's ask him.",
  ["5060901_1"]="Let's follow those footprints.",
  ["5060902_1"]="Hold on. That's...",
  ["5061102_1"]="The mist is too dense. Even the Mist-clearing Lamp won't help us here.",
  ["5061102_2"]="There should be temporary purifiers nearby. Let's activate them.",
  ["5061103_1"]="Oh? The mist is clearing up. I'll try contacting Master Yuanquan...Hmm, no luck. Let's move upward before giving it another shot.",
  ["5061104_1"]="Great job! You're getting the hang of using the Mist-clearing Lamp. You can keep it.",
  ["5061105_1"]="Hmm? Signal's much better now.",
  ["5061105_2"]="Watch my back, Xin. I'm contacting Master Yuanquan again.",
  ["5061106_1"]="Ah, the mist is back! I'm counting on you, Head Librarian of Eme-an!",
  ["5061106_2"]="Yeah, activate all the purifiers just like before.",
  ["5061107_1"]="If you get the angle just right, you can activate multiple purifiers in one go.",
  ["5061201_1"]="Azi? Oh, you're just in time.",
  ["5061202_1"]="Phew, all that hard work paid off! The royal palace is just ahead!",
  ["5061601_1"]="The ground's shaking... Darn it, the dam's cracked again!",
  ["5061601_2"]="I know a bit about the dam structure. I'll go there and check it out.",
  ["5061602_1"]="These are the last coordinates from the locater. Let's search around this area for the drop box.",
  ["5061602_2"]="I'll leave this area to you, Head Librarian.",
  ["5061801_1"]="Damn... That's too many of them. I'll be exhausted at this rate.",
  ["5061801_2"]="Ugh, those pesky beasts!",
  ["5061802_1"]="Those outsiders even left behind these purifiers? ... Hmph, such an unnecessary gesture.",
  ["5061901_1"]="What's that crane up to? Is it asking for food?",
  ["5061901_2"]="Or maybe it's trying to intimidate us? Our owls puff up their feathers like that when they want to scare off enemies!",
  ["5061901_3"]="...I think it wants to play with us.",
  ["5061902_1"]="Look at its feathers. It seems like its life is from Cerulean Water.",
  ["5061902_2"]="You wouldn't want to get pricked by those feathers!",
  ["5061903_1"]="Why did it suddenly take off flying? Is it trying to escape?!",
  ["5061903_2"]="Get out of the way!!",
  ["5061904_1"]="We're here to stop the \"immortality\" from polluting the world.",
  ["5061904_2"]="Don't hold back. If it's invited us, we should give it our all as a sign of respect.",
  ["5070201_1"]="We're almost at the Kanjiang Pavilion.",
  ["5070301_1"]="Let's pull the lever and see what happens.",
  ["5070301_2"]="I just can't resist pulling levers...",
  ["5070301_3"]="Huh?! What's this? A lever?",
  ["5070302_1"]="Try pulling the lever again?",
  ["5070302_2"]="Seriously, when you see a lever, just pull it.",
  ["5070302_3"]="Great, more crystals in the way...",
  ["5070701_1"]="See? Told you! Just follow the wall patterns and play the matching instruments. Easy!",
  ["5070701_2"]="That was pretty straightforward!",
  ["5070701_3"]="A puzzle straight out of ancient times...",
  ["5070702_1"]="Oh? Yeah, there are patterns. If we follow the path we came from and play the instruments from right to left, it might work.",
  ["5070703_1"]="How about we double-check the patterns and play the instruments from right to left?",
  ["5071301_1"]="Where are you, Chi? I mean... Patriarch! Where are you?!",
  ["5071302_1"]="Are those... humans? People tainted by Cerulean Water? They're practically bronze all over!",
  ["5071303_1"]="We're here to help, Patriarch!",
  ["5071304_1"]="Don't bother! I've got this under control!",
  ["5071304_2"]="It's an emergency! Drop the pride! Let me do a special report at your ancestral home later, and we'll call it even.",
  ["5071304_3"]="Yeah, treat us to a feast, and we're square.",
  ["5071305_1"]="Here we are, the sacred lands of my clan.",
  ["5071501_1"]="Look out! Another earthquake... The pillars up ahead are collapsing.",
  ["5071502_1"]="This underground palace is shrouded in thick mist.",
  ["5071502_2"]="Use the Mist-Clearing Lamp to absorb the mist, then release compressed air to shatter those crystals.",
  ["5071503_1"]="These warriors...",
  ["5071503_2"]="Shh, keep it down. Let's not attract their attention...",
  ["5071504_1"]="Wait, there's a guard up ahead.",
  ["5071505_1"]="Let's keep moving. And you, Professor Ming, save the history lecture. We're not on a field trip.",
  ["5071505_2"]="I see a massive gate ahead. Let's check it out.",
  ["5071506_1"]="Hold up, where'd that big guy go?",
  ["5071507_1"]="Love live... the Emperor!!",
  ["5071507_2"]="Run!",
  ["5071508_1"]="Seriously, how big is this palace...?",
  ["5071508_2"]="Carving a city into a mountain's core... Ancient engineers were next-level genius.",
  ["5071509_2"]="Just as how I crushed you before... I can do that over and over again!!!",
  ["5071601_1"]="Finally ditched that big guy... Geez, where are we now? Every spot looks the same!",
  ["5071601_2"]="It's risky staying put here. That guy could show up any minute.",
  ["5071601_3"]="There's an exit up there.",
  ["5071602_1"]="But pulling that lever will set off all the mechanisms at once.",
  ["5071602_2"]="Freeze it with the mist-clearing lamp to halt some of the mechanisms.",
  ["5071602_3"]="I see a hexagonal censer over there, like the one at Kanjiang Pavilion. Must've been made by the same craftsmen. This one likely links to some mechanism too.",
  ["5071603_1"]="Hold on, isn't that the Grand General? Is he parading his troops here?",
  ["5071603_2"]="Long live the Emperor! Long live the royal bloodline!",
  ["5071603_3"]="Emperor! Emperor! Emperor!",
  ["5071604_1"]="Looks like another familiar mechanism.",
  ["5071604_2"]="Remember what I said? Scope out the area and figure out which mechanisms to activate and which to leave untouched.",
  ["5071701_1"]="Ugh, this heat's killing me, and the mist's choking... Legs feel like cement.",
  ["5071701_2"]="Let's pull ourselves together and keep moving.",
  ["5071702_1"]="Bronze bodies are strewn all over.",
  ["5071702_2"]="These sword wounds look familiar... Was it him?",
  ["5071703_1"]="Stop! Watch out!",
  ["5071704_1"]="You?! I knew I wasn't imagining things!",
  ["5071705_1"]="Pfft. That's it?",
  ["5071706_1"]="Did he just talk to me?",
  ["5071706_2"]="Who cares what that rust-bucket says? Just run!",
  ["5071707_1"]="Those crystals again!",
  ["5071707_2"]="The lamp is fading. It needs more mist...",
  ["5071708_1"]="His Majesty wouldn't have turned on us if not for you...!",
  ["5071708_2"]="Your Majesty! Why chose these maggots over us?!",
  ["5071708_3"]="Hey, Patriarch! He's gunning for you now! Your call!",
  ["5071709_1"]="Path's clear. Don't engage, just run.",
  ["5071710_1"]="Hurry! Before he recovers!",
  ["5071801_1"]="Seems like we have to squeeze through these bronze warriors...",
  ["5071801_2"]="Stay quiet. Don't wake the dead...",
  ["5071802_1"]="Why bother? If they wake up, we cut through them.",
  ["5071803_1"]="Look! There's a lever!",
  ["5071804_1"]="This path is blocked by those bronze warriors. We've got to detour.",
  ["5071901_1"]="Heh! Found you again, Li Jun, the so-called Lord of the Weaponry.",
  ["5071901_2"]="Just as how I crushed you before... I can do that over and over again!!!",
  ["5071901_3"]="It's you who should kneel!",
  ["5071901_4"]="Heh, with those rusty mitts of yours? Give me a break!",
  ["5071901_5"]="Even if you claw your way back from hell, you'll tremble at my sight forever!",
  ["5071901_6"]="First your head, then your limbs!",
  ["5071903_2"]="Your Majesty! I'll be your loyal bloodhound forever and ever...",
  ["5071903_3"]="Look at those insects you gracefully sent to their demise!",
  ["5071903_4"]="If you won't bestow us with your reign, I'll nail you to your own throne!",
  ["5071903_5"]="Bound together with the Great Loong! You'll be our eternal emblem!",
  ["5071904_2"]="Your Majesty... May we reign eternal, enduring as sun and moon...",
  ["5072201_1"]="It's scorching out here. If we keep pushing forward, we'll literally get roasted alive.",
  ["5072201_3"]="Alright, let's keep moving.",
  ["5072201_4"]="There's no turning back now.",
  ["5072201_5"]="Then let's wrap everything up fast.",
  ["5072202_2"]="Then we kill it before that happens!",
  ["5072202_3"]="It's still restrained. If it awakens completely, this whole mountain will crumble.",
  ["5072202_4"]="Its body hasn't completely broken free from the mountain just yet.",
  ["5072203_1"]="Its deadly breath is coming. Watch out.",
  ["5072501_1"]="How dare you trespass on the Tianli's ground?! I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget!",
  ["5072502_1"]="Think you can breach the inner yard?!",
  ["5072503_1"]="Running won't save you now!",
  ["5072504_1"]="Trying to escape by climbing the catwalk, huh?",
  ["5072505_1"]="Are these... rocks from the construction site? Perfect! Let this be a lesson to you!",
  ["5072601_1"]="Where did all these farm animals come from? Is there something wrong with the quarantine zone?",
  ["5072601_2"]="Never mind that, we can look into it later. Let's focus on handling those animals!",
  ["5072602_1"]="An overturned van? Did it crash through the quarantine zone? Let's go check it out.",
  ["5072801_1"]="Did those beasts come from behind the cabin?",
  ["5072802_1"]="Perfect, they're all here. Saves me the trouble of searching.",
  ["5072803_1"]="These dummies are holding weapons? Watch out! They're the ones who led the animals here!",
  ["5072804_1"]="Please stand behind me, Head Librarian. I'll deal with these obstacles for you.",
  ["5072805_1"]="My strings are still trembling. Watch out, Sue, more puppets are approaching.",
  ["5073001_1"]="Something feels off... It's too quiet here.",
  ["5073002_2"]="I had a hunch there'd be an ambush!",
  ["5073003_1"]="Let me go! Where... where are you taking me?",
  ["5073003_2"]="That's Tiaohua's voice!",
  ["5073004_1"]="All clear. Let's continue down the street.",
  ["5073005_1"]="Signs of a scuffle lead all the way there.",
  ["5073006_1"]="I said I won't go with you until I see my brother!",
  ["5073006_2"]="The voice is coming from around the street corner. Let's head over there.",
  ["5073201_1"]="The markings on these puppets are fresh. The battle must have just ended.",
  ["5073201_3"]="Follow the trail. You friend should be... close by.",
  ["5073202_2"]="I'm not picking up any puppet activity here... Head in that direction.",
  ["5073203_1"]="Now this is interesting. Why are those dummies fighting animals?",
  ["5073203_2"]="The quarantine zone there is destroyed... Looks like he used those animals as distractions.",
  ["5073204_2"]="No active puppets here... Rest in peace, poor little ones...",
  ["6010101_1"]="A letter is taped to the bookshelf.",
  ["6010101_10"]="Zero shakes her head, her expression conveying the complexity of the situation, suggesting that I will not get an explanation soon.",
  ["6010101_11"]="As we continue delving deeper into the library, we might encounter more supply boxes like this. For now, we must search for Ereshan.",
  ["6010101_2"]="What's this?",
  ["6010101_3"]="Zero swiftly moves in front of me, taking the lead and pulling the letter off the bookshelf. She starts reading it, her expression shows no surprise.",
  ["6010101_4"]="My dear colleague, I have spent countless years within the Library since I embarked on my journey.",
  ["6010101_5"]="No matter how many years of research I invest, this place remains shrouded in mystery. For example, the shattered column directly across from the staircase. My analysis indicates it was broken around eighty years ago, yet the damage resembles that left by modern weapons.",
  ["6010101_6"]="Perhaps one day, we will venture to the end of this Library, but for now, survival is our top priority.",
  ["6010101_7"]="Inside the crate are my surplus supplies. Feel free to use them as needed.",
  ["6010101_8"]="Do you know the writer?",
  ["6010101_9"]="I do not recognize it.",
  ["6020201_1"]="In the corner, you stumble upon a chest. Upon opening it, you find weighty tomes inside. Zero proceeds to examine them.",
  ["6020201_2"]="These appear to be historical documents from the Peace Empire era. They have not been passed down in your timeline, and to Eme-an in the modern world, they hold significant value.",
  ["6020201_3"]="It is possible that Eme-an of that era hid them away to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Emperor of Japheth.",
  ["6020201_4"]="Let's take them away.",
  ["6020201_5"]="We can't just leave them here.",
  ["6020201_6"]="These treasures do not belong to our era. Perhaps during our journey, we will meet someone who can ensure they are safely preserved.",
  ["6020501_1"]="The shattered stone door blocks our path. Through the cracks in the ruins, I catch a glimpse of something gleaming inside.",
  ["6020501_2"]="This pile of stones is unstable and could swallow both the treasures inside and anyone close to it at any moment—unless you tread lightly and carefully...",
  ["6020501_3"]="Retrieving the unknown treasure hidden within will likely take some effort.",
  ["6020601_1"]="A steady stream of clear water flows from the fountain, and within the rippling water curtain, I catch a faint glimmer.",
  ["6020601_2"]="Driven by curiosity, I reach in, trying to feel for the object that caught my eye.",
  ["6030101_1"]="A notice is posted on the wall.",
  ["6030101_2"]="The mechanisms in the outer area of the Known Sector 225 are currently undergoing testing. Unauthorized personnel are advised to take alternate routes. For your safety, various supplies have been provided here. Please feel free to take what you need.",
  ["6030101_3"]="We've got a tough battle up ahead...",
  ["6030101_4"]="Let's grab the supplies and move on.",
  ["6030201_1"]="As I move forward, I suddenly feel something strange beneath my feet, as if something foreign is wedged under the floor, though the surface looks perfectly smooth.",
  ["6030201_2"]="I glance at Zero, and without a word, she steps forward and strikes the floor with her staff, shattering it.",
  ["6030201_3"]="Before us lies an incomprehensible sight—a section of the floor that should have been solid concrete is instead perfectly fitted with a box. Its shape is unsettlingly unstable, as though it might vanish at any moment.",
  ["6030201_4"]="What's going on here?",
  ["6030201_5"]="Does this have anything to do with Ereshan?",
  ["6030201_6"]="Zero shook her head, indicating she wasn't sure, but her expression was unusually serious.",
  ["6030201_7"]="I can feel that something strange is about to happen, and this is just a precursor. If we're going to open the box, we need to act while it's still stable enough.",
  ["6030301_1"]="Wait.",
  ["6030301_2"]="As we reached the far end of the control room, Nanna suddenly stopped. Shamash wasn't surprised, knowing that beneath this section of the floor lay one of the two power hubs for the central control system.",
  ["6030301_3"]="Just to be safe, let's double-check the power system. If the computing modules are connected in parallel but can't be activated, all our efforts will have been for nothing.",
  ["6030401_1"]="Nanna.",
  ["6030401_2"]="Shamash suddenly called out to Nanna.",
  ["6030401_3"]="I understand. The space was too unstable earlier, it could have affected the power system.",
  ["6030401_4"]="She stepped aside and turned her gaze toward the power system hub beneath.",
  ["6040101_1"]="You notice numerous items scattered along the riverbank, but they don't appear to be trash.",
  ["6040101_2"]="Are these yours?",
  ["6040101_3"]="Yes, I figured it's always better to be prepared. I brought extra supplies, thinking I'd definitely catch some fish, but who knew they wouldn't bite at all?",
  ["6040101_4"]="It's definitely their fault I couldn't catch anything!",
  ["6040101_5"]="Sigh, I'm planning to toss them out later. If you don't mind, Secretary Qing, feel free to pick out anything useful from the pile. At least this way, they won't go to waste.",
  ["6040101_6"]="..Alright, thank you.",
  ["6040201_1"]="Xin notices a utility pole on the roadside that looks unstable, pressed down by a tree trunk and on the verge of collapsing.",
  ["6040201_2"]="This is way too dangerous. What if it falls?",
  ["6040201_3"]="With some effort, Xin manages to move the trunk away, revealing a damaged electrical box underneath with an aluminum plate inside.",
  ["6040201_4"]="The aluminum plate reads, \"Instructions for repair are provided here. Those who assist with maintenance during the malfunction may take a thank-you gift here.\"",
  ["6040201_5"]="Below the message is an extremely simple diagram that even a toddler could understand.",
  ["6040201_6"]="Oh, wait. I think I get it—it's like instructions on how to fix it, right?",
  ["6040301_1"]="With some effort, Xin fends off the sudden influx of frenzied animals.",
  ["6040301_2"]="At that moment, something shiny on the ground catches Xin's attention. Could it have been dropped by those animals?",
  ["6040505_1"]="After some effort, Xin hears a faint hum from the switchboard, and the streetlights begin to illuminate one by one.",
  ["6040505_2"]="In the newfound light, she spots several damaged crates tucked away in a corner.",
  ["6040602_1"]="Startled by the noise, the resident opens the door to peer at you, trying to figure out what is going on.",
  ["6040602_10"]="...",
  ["6040602_11"]="Uh, please don't be mad. I promise I won't do it again.",
  ["6040602_12"]="I haven't even thanked you for helping me clear things up. How about this: I'll give you some of my stockpiles. Be careful while patrolling out there!",
  ["6040602_13"]="Thank you.",
  ["6040602_14"]="You stay safe too.",
  ["6040602_2"]="Huh? Did you guys move the fortifications I had at my door?",
  ["6040602_3"]="Fortifications?",
  ["6040602_4"]="Those boxes! Lately, I've been hearing animal howls. With those, dangerous animals won't be able to get into my house.",
  ["6040602_5"]="...",
  ["6040602_6"]="...",
  ["6040602_7"]="Could it be that...?",
  ["6040602_8"]="Huh? Did you ever think about what you'd do if a fire broke out? How would you escape?",
  ["6040602_9"]="Ahaha, I totally forgot about that.",
  ["6040603_1"]="Startled by the noise, the resident opens the door to peer at you, trying to figure out what is going on.",
  ["6040603_2"]="Upon realizing that our efforts to clear the debris at his door had attracted a swarm of mosquitoes, he looked a bit embarrassed. Nevertheless, he thanked us sincerely and handed over a small token of appreciation.",
  ["6040603_3"]="Thank you.",
  ["6040603_4"]="You might want to consider cleaning up the front door sometime.",
  ["6040701_1"]="A ciziten waiting in the queue appears troubled, muttering to herself.",
  ["6040701_2"]="What's happening?",
  ["6040701_3"]="Do you need help?",
  ["6040701_4"]="Upon further investigation, she explains that she recently moved to CangLin City and got lost trying to locate the Emergency Department.",
  ["6040701_5"]="You'll find a map at the entrance of the hospital.",
  ["6040701_6"]="If I remember right...",
  ["6040701_7"]="The Emergency Department is at the rear of this building.",
  ["6040701_8"]="The ciziten expresses her gratitude and presents a gift.",
  ["6040801_1"]="The city's iconic lotus leaves drifted gently across the surface of the water tank. The water, much deeper than I had imagined, concealed a strange cerulean figure, veiling its depths.",
  ["6040801_2"]="Is it just my imagination?",
  ["6040801_3"]="Why does it feel...",
  ["6040801_4"]="There's something down there.",
  ["6040801_5"]="I suppressed my unease and plunged my hand into the murky depths of the water tank.",
  ["6040901_1"]="After dealing with the mosquitoes, I finally realized what had caught my attention earlier—a damaged locked box, from which the mosquitoes had been swarming out.",
  ["6040901_2"]="There could be something useful inside. Try cracking it open.",
  ["6050101_1"]="Besides the clean water, there are other supplies on the truck, and you assist the driver in unloading them.",
  ["6050102_1"]="Following that, the driver appears puzzled by a stack of unfamiliar crates. It seems he has never handled crates like these before and is clueless how to open them.",
  ["6050102_2"]="I know how to open them.",
  ["6050102_3"]="Let me give you a hand.",
  ["6050103_1"]="Upon opening the crates, you find them packed with supplies.",
  ["6050103_2"]="These supplies include items meant for the driver, who generously shares them with you.",
  ["6050201_1"]="Due to beast attacks, a portion of the cargo being transported was abandoned along the route. Help them in transporting it.",
  ["6050201_2"]="Look around carefully, as there might be other similar crates nearby.",
  ["6050302_1"]="Upon opening the box, you are swarmed by a pack of frenzied mosquitoes affected by the Cerulean Water.",
  ["6050302_2"]="After dealing with the mosquitoes, a worker arrives, apologizing for the trouble and handing you paper towels to wipe off the water stains.",
  ["6050302_3"]="The worker clarifies that it's actually a mosquito bait box. Outdoor work often involves dealing with mosquitoes. The bait box, filled with warm water, effectively attracts mosquitoes, thus aiding the workers.",
  ["6050302_4"]="He apologizes for the accident that happened to you.",
  ["6050302_5"]="Don't worry, it's okay.",
  ["6050302_6"]="You really should place a warning sign here.",
  ["6050302_7"]="As a gesture of apology, the worker compensates you.",
  ["6050401_1"]="There's a box placed next to the apartment building, with a note seemingly attached to it.",
  ["6050401_10"]="Xin carefully folded the note and tucked it into her pocket.",
  ["6050401_2"]="Hmm? What's this? Let me take a look.",
  ["6050401_3"]="Xin picks up the note but struggles to read it. Soon, she looks puzzled and embarrassed.",
  ["6050401_4"]="Let me handle it.",
  ["6050401_5"]="I'll read it for you.",
  ["6050401_6"]="The note reads, \"Thank you, patrolling sister! I often see you running around helping people! Here are some gifts for you!\"",
  ["6050401_7"]="It's just work, nothing special. I didn't do anything extraordinary, really.",
  ["6050401_8"]="Although Xin denies her efforts, I can tell she's quite pleased with the outcome.",
  ["6050401_9"]="We took the comfort items from the box.",
  ["6050501_1"]="The box seemed to be lost cargo box, stamped with a food label boasting a shelf life of ten years.",
  ["6050501_2"]="Though the shelf life seemed almost unbelievable, they promised the taste would always be guaranteed.",
  ["6050501_3"]="\"Even in the toughest situations, good food makes everything easier—how can you solve problems on an empty stomach?\" That's what a truck driver in Qian once told me.",
  ["6050601_1"]="The lost cargo box, marked with a food label, appeared to be packed with instant meals specifically meant for truck drivers.",
  ["6050601_2"]="Instant noodles, instant rice, instant porridge, instant soup, even instant hotpot... everything was designed for convenience. Qian's people always made sure they could enjoy a warm meal, no matter where they were.",
  ["6060401_1"]="This Tianli resident seems to be preparing a tea that's a specialty of the region, and when he saw us outsiders, he warmly invited us to join him in making it.",
  ["6060401_2"]="Let me give it a try.",
  ["6060401_3"]="I love good tea.",
  ["6060402_1"]="With the resident's guidance, we swiftly prepare the tea. The fragrance fills the air, blending aromas from various ingredients including ginger, peanuts, and glutinous rice. It differs from typical milk tea.",
  ["6060402_2"]="A sip reveals a rich aroma and a complex blend of flavors, giving a refreshing aftertaste.",
  ["6060402_3"]="After drinking the tea, the Tianli resident kindly gave us some souvenirs.",
  ["6060601_1"]="A red paper notice was posted at the temple's entrance, listing the names of kind-hearted donors as a gesture of gratitude for their contributions. Beneath the notice, neatly arranged supplies awaited distribution, likely from previous donations.",
  ["6060601_2"]="Due to the current situation, the temple is temporarily unable to distribute supplies to those in need. Please feel free to take what you need from the donations.",
  ["6060601_3"]="We dropped some cash into the charity box nearby and began selecting the supplies we needed.",
  ["6060801_2"]="There is a trace of disturbed moss on the ground, suggesting that a crate was once placed here before someone forcefully dragged it away.",
  ["6060801_3"]="Upon closer inspection, traces of animal fur seem to cling to the ground.",
  ["6060801_4"]="A sudden sense of unease washes over me—the same feeling I had back on the Tianli catwalk.",
  ["6070501_1"]="There's a hidden secret here. If someone skilled can restore the link, the true essense will be revealed.",
  ["6071301_2"]="Ouch, my back! Can any kind soul lend me a hand…? I'll make it worth your while!"
